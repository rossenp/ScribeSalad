00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>This episode of what if discussed is brought to you by manscaped.</v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.940
<v 1>Obviously people are in different situations.</v>

3
00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:11.660
Some people have a really terrible time. They're living in Palm,

4
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:15.380
Greek at living where there are a lot of people around it, close quarters.

5
00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:19.610
And for them it's a very scary time. People have lost their jobs.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.200
People are dealing with all kinds of very difficult circumstances,

7
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:26.600
maybe have lost, loved ones or friends,

8
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.130
even for those people who haven't suffered the worst of COVID.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.833
It's a challenge.

10
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.520
<v 0>So Peter, I've asked you this before,</v>

11
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.410
but sort of a different time. So I'll ask you again,

12
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.330
how are you doing? You mean in terms of a pandemic and my,

13
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.200
my mental acuity while it's kind of a loaded question in these times,

14
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:07.460
I guess all things considered I'm doing all right. At least outwardly facing.

15
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.050
Um, but you know, the pandemic's been tougher on some people more than others.

16
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.070
Yeah. I mean, it's, it's eight to nine months into what's. Uh, you know,

17
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:20.540
it's almost a cliche now to say unprecedented times what it is. Um,

18
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.840
but now as you know, many people,

19
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.920
depending on where you live in the world are also facing sort of second waves,

20
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.540
you know, uh,

21
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.860
new lockdowns sort of starting to re you know,

22
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.140
reacclimate themselves to what potentially could be a, a tough winter, right.

23
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.120
Uh, with lockdowns isolation.

24
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.940
But it depends who you are because you have heightened anxiety about your

25
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:47.240
health, about your family's health, about your, about your financial situation.

26
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.520
There's a lot going on. It's tough. Yeah.

27
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.950
I'm getting a little bit anxious knowing that, uh, you know,

28
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:53.150
we're heading into about,

29
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.870
I don't know that we're necessarily heading into a lockdown in this city,

30
00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:01.790
but we're certainly heading into six months of winter where

31
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:05.060
I'm going to be inside. Not speaking with a lot of people face to face,

32
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.110
and we already have heard over the last X amount of years, I don't know, five,

33
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.680
10 years is kind of when I remember the word starting or the acronym,

34
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.960
sad, seasonal affective disorders. That is, yeah. That's what it stands for.

35
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.740
So that's something we've started to understand more so again,

36
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.000
without getting too in-depth about it. I mean, essentially,

37
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.090
it's kind of what happens when the days get shorter,

38
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:32.840
but also you don't get outside more. Oh, the days are getting shorter. My gosh.

39
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.500
Yes. And then the sun, although interestingly breaking news,

40
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:40.250
hopefully something we can report, uh, here in the coming weeks,

41
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:45.140
there is the contemplation of not putting the clocks backwards or

42
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:47.330
forwards canceling daylight savings,

43
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:51.590
which I have been a proponent of for the last 25 years. Well, if not now,

44
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:55.670
when yeah, exactly. This is so yes, this is the time to do it.

45
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.080
I could almost see like people revolting if they don't do it, but it's a,

46
00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:03.040
it's a tool in the toolbox that governments should seriously consider. Uh,

47
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.740
but seasonal effective disorder is something that, again,

48
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.640
depending on who you are and you know, some people suffer more than others,

49
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.000
but now as you enter a specific time where you're like, okay, wait a sec,

50
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.970
seasonal affective disorder, plus I'm going to be in lockdown a lot.

51
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.940
This recipe for a lot of people is pretty scary.

52
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.220
<v 2>Sunlight loss of vitamin D. And now a lot of people are saying, you know, what,</v>

53
00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:26.910
if we're in lockdown throughout the winter, how challenging would that be? Well,

54
00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:27.720
it's an understanding.

55
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.300
<v 0>One more question. And it's one I've had,</v>

56
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:33.600
I've been in conversations where people are literally asking that like, man, I,

57
00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:35.370
this is, this is really freaking me out.

58
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.600
So obviously when we're faced with a situation like that,

59
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:43.980
we'd like to obviously be able to use science and also be able to

60
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:47.670
provide hopefully some helpful guidance to people when possible.

61
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.540
And in this particular case, I think we probably, I mean,

62
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:55.650
we literally are bringing on today, the person who not only coined the term,

63
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.370
a seasonal affective disorder, uh, sad,

64
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.480
but also literally wrote the book on the subject. Um,

65
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.630
Dr. Norman E Rosenthal.

66
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.110
<v 2>Dr. Norman E Rosenthal is a world renowned researcher and</v>

67
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:18.090
psychiatrist who led the team who first described seasonal affective disorder

68
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.890
or sad. He's also a sought after public speaker and a bestselling author.

69
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.370
Who's known for his innovative research and inspirational writings.

70
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.230
He's currently the clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown university

71
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:35.730
school of medicine and is listed as one of the best doctors in America.

72
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.370
Dr. Rosenthal has written over 200 scholarly articles and authored or

73
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.090
coauthored eight popular books, including winter blues,

74
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.580
the New York times bestseller transcendence,

75
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.720
and the Los Angeles times bestseller the gift of adversity.

76
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.860
Dr. Rosenthal, thank you for joining us today on what if.

77
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.380
<v 1>Oh, it's a pleasure to be here. So we wanted to have you on, well, we want to.</v>

78
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.680
<v 0>No, I have you on for a couple of reasons. Uh, you know,</v>

79
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:06.540
one is that many people,

80
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:11.430
these days are wary of what looks like at least in the West, uh,

81
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.010
a long-term lockdown possibly a couple of months possibly

82
00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:17.970
into the spring.

83
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.340
So you combine that with the winter months and you have people

84
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.030
concerned about how that could affect people, could have a mental health crisis.

85
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.100
So you are the person who literally coined the term seasonal affective disorder

86
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.660
or sad you and your team.

87
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.920
And you're also somebody who writes a lot about how to deal with it and how to

88
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.870
inspire the ability of many people to feel better during

89
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:47.100
these times. So, first of all, let's start with sad. What is sad?

90
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.571
<v 1>Well,</v>

91
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:53.550
it is a condition where the days are getting shorter and darker

92
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.000
and some people are very susceptible behaviorally and emotionally to

93
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:03.050
those changes may begin to feel a low energy level.

94
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.390
They have a hard time waking up in the morning.

95
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.580
Everything seems to lose that special luster that it had in the summertime.

96
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.230
They lose enthusiasm, and sometimes it gets even worse than that.

97
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:19.730
They over eat that oversleep and they can lose their ability to

98
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:21.980
function. Optimally, it works,

99
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:26.750
suffers their personal relationships suffer and they can end up feeling very

100
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:28.550
down and depressed and anxious.

101
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.360
So there's a spectrum ranging from the mild to the severe.

102
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:36.170
I've given you a more severe picture, but that is the full blown,

103
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.390
seasonal affective disorder or sad.

104
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.650
<v 3>How does it differ from just regular depression?</v>

105
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.380
Is it just that it's in different seasons or is there something else to it?

106
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.530
<v 1>Sunlight, et cetera. Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.240
Since it's clue is that it occurs seasonally as you, our,

108
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.890
we are now entering the autumn.

109
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.970
So if somebody's been very well through the summer and they suddenly begin to

110
00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:01.090
feel not so well, all the things I've described,

111
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.920
then they may think that they have seasonal affective disorder. And then I said,

112
00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:08.860
think back, how did you feel last Thanksgiving?

113
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.660
How did you feel at Christmas time?

114
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.420
If you weren't the life and soul of the party,

115
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:18.220
if you just resented all those Christmas tours and didn't enjoy

116
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.780
all the things that we are supposed to celebrate at that time of the year,

117
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:27.100
maybe you have seasonal affective disorder and not just regular depression.

118
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.300
Hmm.

119
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.910
<v 3>Uh, you've been treating people for over three decades now,</v>

120
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.270
30 years and been on the cutting edge of research in the field of mental health,

121
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.660
um, suffice to say you are tapped in to the collective psyche.

122
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.610
What are your patients telling you these days about these unprecedented

123
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:43.444
times?

124
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.310
<v 1>Well, even before the seasonal affective disorder kicked in,</v>

125
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:52.690
and now I'm hearing from my patients that they're beginning to feel it certainly

126
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:55.840
here in the mid Atlantic region up North,

127
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.690
they've probably felt it for a while and down South.

128
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:02.050
They probably aren't feeling it yet. But, um,

129
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.610
what I hear and have heard is that there are tremendous

130
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.360
emotional stresses involved in the COVID story.

131
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.530
And obviously people are in different situations.

132
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:17.230
Some people have a really terrible time.

133
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.540
They living in congregate living,

134
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.600
where there are a lot of people around a close quarters.

135
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:27.220
And for them it's a very scary time. People have lost their jobs.

136
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.660
People are dealing with all kinds of very difficult

137
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:35.920
circumstances may be, have lost, loved ones or friends. Uh,

138
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.780
but even for those people who haven't suffered the worst of COVID, uh,

139
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.610
it's a challenge, uh,

140
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.630
because we've lost a lot of the things that we came to love and depend upon

141
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.520
eating out, traveling, hacking our children,

142
00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:56.400
our grandchildren dating, if we're single, um,

143
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.020
you know, the idea of romance, all of these things as a style,

144
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.520
as our style has been crimped in regard to all of these things.

145
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.530
And, um, you know,

146
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:12.150
a lot of people are sort of throwing caution to the wind and having

147
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:16.920
these connections in groups closely connected with each other.

148
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:21.450
But then a lot of them are coming down sick and we've heard the plaintiff, uh,

149
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.820
messages on TV. I wish I'd listened. It really is worse than you think.

150
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:30.570
And then, you know, it's, it's a very variable illness.

151
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:34.560
Some people hardly get ill at all, and that can fool you.

152
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:36.450
And some people get very, very ill.

153
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.010
So it's an unexpected thing that we're dealing with.

154
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:42.510
We don't know what we're dealing with.

155
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:45.870
And so there's fear and anxiety and deprivation.

156
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.410
That's what we're dealing with on top of the seasonal affective disorder.

157
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.090
<v 0>A lot of the work that you are doing these days is,</v>

158
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:58.880
is obviously focused around helping people deal with the times we

159
00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:02.510
find ourselves in. We talked about sad already.

160
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.550
We talked about the potential of a real mental health challenges

161
00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:08.930
going into the winter months.

162
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.550
What are some of the things or anything specific that you're

163
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.650
telling people tips wise to help them cope with, uh,

164
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.810
the challenges that they're facing right now?

165
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.930
<v 1>Well, I think that as, uh, the revered, uh,</v>

166
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.480
psychiatrist, Victor Frankl said,

167
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.550
you can take anything away from the person accused or her

168
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.200
choice to view a situation. And in his or her own way,

169
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.780
how you view a situation makes all the difference to how you deal with it.

170
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:50.000
So I think that if you look at what you have your

171
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:54.680
circumstances and say, okay, this is reality. I have to accept it.

172
00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.050
It's no point saying, well, I wish there weren't an epidemic.

173
00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:04.880
I wish there were not a pandemic. You know, that doesn't help anybody.

174
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.990
It's much better to say, look, this is the situation we're dealing with.

175
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.790
How can we do the best job of it? And then once you faced up to that,

176
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.020
then there are several things that I have found to be really helpful.

177
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.290
The first is to maintain, structuring your day.

178
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.190
You're going to bed and waking up, do it on time,

179
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.680
make your bed in the morning. Lecture place look lived in and decent,

180
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:33.440
not like a college dorm. Um,

181
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.020
and then exercise is fantastic because it's part of the body's way

182
00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:43.970
of tuning itself up, eat properly. And, um,

183
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.590
I meditate.

184
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.940
I find that meditation is an amazing tool to help me get through.

185
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.920
And then I use lights, lights in the morning and dark in the evening,

186
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.770
or two fives, your circadian rhythms,

187
00:11:56.771 --> 00:12:00.340
those daily clock clock processes that go on

188
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.170
unconsciously in our bodies. Every cell has a little cluck in it,

189
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.460
and there's a master cell in the brain that orchestrates all these cells and

190
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:13.660
they make our sleeping awaking as efficient as possible.

191
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:16.720
So work with your circadian rhythms and lightened,

192
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:21.160
dark powerful stimuli, that curiosity, Caden rhythms.

193
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.130
So once you're doing all those things,

194
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.790
you keeping your structure normal that's step number one.

195
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.250
<v 0>Um, in your book, the gift of adversity, it's a, it's subtitled,</v>

196
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:36.630
the unexpected benefits of life's difficulties, setbacks, and imperfections.

197
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.320
How would you say this applies to the times we find ourselves in now?

198
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.900
<v 1>Well, it's a great question. What is it that we cannot do now? We can't go out.</v>

199
00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:50.100
We can't eat out. We can socialize. We're pretty much stuck.

200
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.000
So in my own case, for example,

201
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.340
I've wanted to write a book for a long,

202
00:12:56.341 --> 00:12:59.430
long time on the healing powers of poetry.

203
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.140
It's just love of mine all my life, and I never really got round to it.

204
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.690
But now with all the time that I have in terms of not doing

205
00:13:09.691 --> 00:13:11.190
the things I just mentioned,

206
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.080
it's the first time I've actually knuckled down and I'm nearly done with that

207
00:13:16.081 --> 00:13:20.670
book. So, uh, that is an example, but everybody's going to be different.

208
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.830
Um, I talked recently to a woman who was

209
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.380
supposed to have her child get to teaching online and

210
00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:34.920
the teaching fell through for the day and she thought, well,

211
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.760
why don't we bake cupcakes? So they baked cupcakes.

212
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.500
And so little mini example,

213
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.750
but these are just two tiny examples of an infinite variety

214
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:49.710
of things that we can do. It. We're created my clients.

215
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:54.120
Some of them are starting to paint. Some of them are learning to sing.

216
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.630
All of these things, incidentally can be facilitated online.

217
00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.760
One of them is making jewelry.

218
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.720
The opportunities for a creative and

219
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.530
inventive person are endless.

220
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.060
So I would say don't just see it as an unmitigated

221
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.923
disaster.

222
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.790
Think about it as an opportunity to do things that you may always have wanted to

223
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:20.190
do, but never actually got around to.

224
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.060
<v 0>Going to be a lot of fallout, legacy, collateral damage.</v>

225
00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:27.480
However you want to term it of this particular period that we're in and

226
00:14:27.481 --> 00:14:28.950
especially in your field,

227
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:33.900
in the area of psychiatry and helping people deal with whether it's

228
00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:35.820
PTSD, whatever that is,

229
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.370
this feels like there'll be even new areas of study post

230
00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:45.360
COVID and perhaps pre other things down the line.

231
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.350
What do you anticipate some of those new fields of study might be?

232
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:50.431
<v 1>Well,</v>

233
00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:55.310
I think all kinds of new opportunities are going to come out of this pandemic

234
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.781
or example.

235
00:14:56.781 --> 00:15:01.220
We know that a lot of people are realizing that they can work very well from

236
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:02.054
home.

237
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.370
So I know a colleague who runs a large company and

238
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.320
70% of their people say they don't want to go back to work after the

239
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.970
COVID is over. And I think a lot of people are feeling that way.

240
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:17.900
And then of course,

241
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:23.060
a lot of corporations are licking their lips at the idea of not having to

242
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.470
retain so much real estate with people working at home.

243
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.240
And then of course,

244
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.370
that then creates a challenge for people who are holding that really state.

245
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:39.170
So the whole society has this ripple effect going through it based on

246
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:42.680
these new discoveries. Um, for example,

247
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.610
my own practice is now gone totally virtual online.

248
00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:50.240
I hope that someday sooner, rather than later,

249
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.820
I will be able to see clients in my own office.

250
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.860
But I think that all kinds of possibilities are opening up that weren't there

251
00:15:57.861 --> 00:15:58.694
before.

252
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.570
<v 3>I agree. I think it's a necessity is the mother of invention.</v>

253
00:16:01.571 --> 00:16:05.440
I think though the world is going to change possibly a lot of the ways for the

254
00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:09.550
better, because we have to figure out how to navigate this time. Dr. Rosenthal,

255
00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:13.600
you're also sought after as a motivational speaker to inspire people around the

256
00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:17.050
world. What are some inspiring words you might be able to leave us with today?

257
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.670
<v 1>Well, I would say stay connected, reach out to friends,</v>

258
00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:26.650
reach out to family. How are you doing, how you feeling, um,

259
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.470
be connected. We, we, uh,

260
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.890
know that loneliness is a very toxic state.

261
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.800
One thing I'm finding for example,

262
00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:40.600
is people with addictions of all kind can now attend their

263
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.170
12 step meetings or other meetings virtually online.

264
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.720
So it makes it very easy,

265
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.890
but you don't have to have an addiction in order to access a group,

266
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.320
find a group of people who resonate with you and with whom

267
00:16:56.321 --> 00:17:00.340
you can actually make connections. I think that's such an important part. We,

268
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.990
humans are not meant to be alone. We're meant to walk.

269
00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:08.140
Primates are meant to grow and evolve in groups in

270
00:17:08.141 --> 00:17:11.380
societies, do something creative,

271
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.340
do something innovative, do something fun, fun.

272
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.040
Don't squeeze all the fun out of your life.

273
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.010
That's what I told a client of mine recently,

274
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.070
who's working so hard day and night. I said,

275
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.350
you're squeezing all the fun out of your life.

276
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.600
And that leaves us with a feeling of deprivation that we need to replace with

277
00:17:31.601 --> 00:17:32.434
something.

278
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.660
So just have fun into an unusual gift to

279
00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:42.040
somebody that you thinking about or that you care about. Um,

280
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:46.840
I think we have to invent ourselves, invent our lifestyles,

281
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:51.870
invent our relationships in new ways. So spend a little time being creative.

282
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.520
And of course it's become a buzzword now gratitude,

283
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.830
uh, but it truly is a wonderful state of being,

284
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.880
uh, just checking in with yourself. Some people write a formal

285
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.300
gratitude checklist every day.

286
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.140
I just keep reminding myself that I'm alive.

287
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.210
And part of this amazing pageant that is the 21st century

288
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.070
with all its Horace and all its nastiness and none the less

289
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.540
fascinating place to be in a fascinating time. So

290
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.580
accepts that carnival to the extent that you can. Hmm.

291
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.721
<v 0>So you, don't your,</v>

292
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:38.360
your prescription isn't Doritos and Netflix necessarily occasionally perhaps,

293
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.230
um, uh, great words and, and inspiring.

294
00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:44.570
And I think important for people to hear and hear again.

295
00:18:44.571 --> 00:18:48.530
And I think the idea of reinventing yourself taking the opportunity,

296
00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:53.120
but in the end, it's really about first step is, is, is seeing it, uh,

297
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.110
as, as something that can be constructive versus destructive. Uh,

298
00:18:57.111 --> 00:18:59.750
we really appreciate, can you stick around, uh,

299
00:18:59.751 --> 00:19:03.140
we have a few more questions that, uh, we'd like to get to on the audio version,

300
00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:06.350
but first, um, where can people find your work?

301
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.050
<v 1>This place is my website,</v>

302
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.790
Norman rosenthal.com and the website will access all my social

303
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:18.110
media, the Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,

304
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.540
Instagram, et cetera.

305
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:25.580
And these are all places you can find me and read about

306
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.220
things that I love and things that I know about.

307
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.490
I've got a lot of blogs up there and, uh,

308
00:19:31.491 --> 00:19:34.730
so please check me out.

309
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.260
<v 0>And yes, you can purchase the books there as well. Um, uh,</v>

310
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:43.010
we'll be back with Dr. Rosenthal on the other side, please sit tight, uh,

311
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.750
Dr. Rosenthal and Peter, and I will sort of take care of some business and,

312
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.940
uh, and, and review the first part of the show, uh, for people who want to,

313
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:57.560
who want to get the audio version, uh, click on the link below, right?

314
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.220
That's right. We'll uh, if you're already listening to the audio version,

315
00:20:01.221 --> 00:20:02.540
you're going to look around, but, uh.

316
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.380
<v 1>For video, I don't know if I have one, one or two minutes more,</v>

317
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.070
but I failed to mention transcendental meditation,

318
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.900
which is the kind of meditation that's been quite transformative in my life.

319
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.580
And I recommend very, very highly I've written two books on that subject,

320
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:24.980
transcendence and Superman. And of course I have a book called winter blues.

321
00:20:24.981 --> 00:20:29.450
That's the standard for seasonal effective disorder and the gift of adversity.

322
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.670
So these are some things that may provide people with some comfort, inspiration,

323
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.680
and new ideas at this time.

324
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.870
<v 0>Some tools for people looking to deal with difficult times, but not necessarily,</v>

325
00:20:41.871 --> 00:20:44.870
depending on your attitude, negative times.

326
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.760
It's ultimately about your perspective, Dr. Rosenthal sit tight.

327
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:53.350
We'll be back after this. Thanks. Thank you. So, Peter,

328
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:57.790
I believe it's Einstein who once said that the definition of insanity

329
00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:58.624
is.

330
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.820
<v 3>Equals MC squared. That.</v>

331
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.360
<v 0>I think that's something else that's relative.</v>

332
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.970
<v 3>Insanity is, uh,</v>

333
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.810
performing a repetitive task over and over and expecting a different.

334
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.530
<v 0>Correct. So we sat here, I dunno, a couple of weeks ago, I believe.</v>

335
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.970
And, uh, the people at home were treated to you figuring out that,

336
00:21:17.971 --> 00:21:22.110
you know what, maybe not shaving for three months with my Methuselah,

337
00:21:22.111 --> 00:21:26.100
like clay off beard was not the way to go. And you.

338
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.930
<v 3>Of course, we're saved by,</v>

339
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.680
I was saved by the lawnmower 3.0 for manscaped.

340
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.260
I shaved everything. Right. I mean, it wasn't that long.

341
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.071
I was just sitting here.

342
00:21:35.071 --> 00:21:39.690
I do keep it quite trim like this and just shaved the big pile of yuck right

343
00:21:39.691 --> 00:21:40.860
there. I'm sorry to discuss.

344
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.410
<v 0>Better. Thank you. You felt better.</v>

345
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.140
<v 3>Uh, yeah, I did feel better and I do feel better.</v>

346
00:21:46.141 --> 00:21:50.700
And I'm going to use this lawnmower 3.0 from manscape to probably keep it trim

347
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.670
and maybe even shave the whole thing off.

348
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.780
<v 0>Well, as we go into another period of isolation and lockdown,</v>

349
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.120
and we did talk to Dr. Rosenthal today,

350
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.170
there's plenty of things around structure and sort of keeping your life normal

351
00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:07.110
in a way that's going to help you deal with the challenges.

352
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.920
One of those things is definitely not, uh, not showering,

353
00:22:10.921 --> 00:22:15.240
not shaving getting into the sweats and not getting out of bed that literally

354
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.740
not only will you look better with the old lawnmower 3.0 and a clean shave

355
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.350
you'll feel better. You'll feel better and manslaughter.

356
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.150
<v 2>As changed the grooming game with their perfect package. 3.0 essentials kit.</v>

368
00:23:12.811 --> 00:23:16.020
What if 20 that's? What if that's,

369
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.140
what if 20 all one word well done? Well said. Thank you.

370
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.350
<v 0>Um, and it is interesting. It's an easy segue, because again,</v>

371
00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:25.890
we're talking about, you know, most of the, at least the Western world is,

372
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:31.110
is going into two things, one probably a second extended lockdown, potentially,

373
00:23:31.111 --> 00:23:32.040
however that works.

374
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.930
And however long that might be too combined with the wind the fall months,

375
00:23:36.931 --> 00:23:39.150
and then the winter months, which can be challenging.

376
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:41.970
As we talked about with Dr. Rosenthal already,

377
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.160
for people that deal with seasonal effective disorder. Now they're staring down.

378
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.610
<v 3>Six. I mean, we're depending on what hemisphere you live in.</v>

379
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:52.700
And we live in a colder one where we're looking at six,

380
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.600
seven more months of cold, not to, not to depress anybody. No.

381
00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.340
<v 0>But I mean, it is, but again, back to what Dr. Rosenthal talked about,</v>

382
00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.810
it's avoidance, isn't gonna work either, right? So, um,

383
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.230
attitude is everything. And I know when, when you're,

384
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.500
when you're suffering and I've dealt with mental health issues, you know,

385
00:24:11.501 --> 00:24:13.780
I don't know a lot of people these days who haven't,

386
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.840
it can sometimes almost bother you to hear somebody say, ah,

387
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.610
just turn the frown upside down. Right. But in this particular case,

388
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.230
the good news is it's also accompanied by not necessarily

389
00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:29.590
regulatory health tips, because a lot of these you're like, wow,

390
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.750
they all make sense. But in this particular case,

391
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.820
they don't just make sense for your physical health.

392
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.680
They make sense for your mental health.

393
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.910
<v 3>Yeah. And I think you bring up a good point. I think we should not, uh,</v>

394
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.980
nobody should be stigmatized by mental health.

395
00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.560
I think we're getting to this point in the world now that, uh,

396
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:49.270
mental health is health and people should be able to talk about it and

397
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.970
admit that they're a, that they're having a hard time.

398
00:24:51.971 --> 00:24:56.050
So I don't think anybody should be going through these times and be afraid to

399
00:24:56.051 --> 00:24:59.800
mention what's going on or be ashamed, especially in sure. Especially now.

400
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.890
<v 0>Was real serious stuff. Yeah. And he,</v>

401
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.700
and that sort of dovetails into something else he talked about. Um,

402
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.970
have you heard of blue zones? Uh, I don't know.

403
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.630
There are these areas of study. I recently read about that.

404
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.810
<v 3>No, I do know like Japan is a blue zone. Yeah, of course.</v>

405
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.370
<v 0>It's in Japan, Italy where these people live to like 110,</v>

406
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.640
like I'm exaggerating here. But so of course,

407
00:25:24.641 --> 00:25:26.800
when they started to see this over decades, they were like,

408
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.620
we got to study these people, what's in the water over there. Like,

409
00:25:29.621 --> 00:25:33.430
why are they whatever they seem to be. So of course they study these people.

410
00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:37.120
I think there's pockets in Italy, there's pockets in Japan, to your point.

411
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.330
There's other places, even some, some rural parts of China,

412
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.460
some parts of South Africa. But again,

413
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.660
the one thing they had in common was that people lived longer and happier,

414
00:25:46.661 --> 00:25:51.280
healthier lot. So of course was diet important. Yes.

415
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.990
Was it the number one? No. Was exercise important? Yes.

416
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.090
Was it the number one? No.

417
00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.860
The number one determinant of these long happy healthy lives, Peter was what.

418
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.220
<v 3>Uh, well, I'm going to say mental health, but there's probably a,</v>

419
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.520
you can probably narrow it.

420
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.130
<v 0>From connection and social interaction, social interaction. Okay.</v>

421
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.460
As he talked about, like when people feel dis people don't feel,

422
00:26:15.461 --> 00:26:20.140
they have people care about them who need them, who, uh,

423
00:26:20.141 --> 00:26:22.630
you know, it, it translates into, you know,

424
00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:25.510
what do I have to live for and what they have found again. And again,

425
00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:29.470
this is the science proves that social interaction is very important to our,

426
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.140
to our overall health and long and happy, healthy laws.

427
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.800
We're of course not in a period where we're going to be able to do that the way

428
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:40.180
we used to do it in person going to concerts, going to games,

429
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.580
going to bars, going to restaurants, friends, places.

430
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.320
But as Dr. Rosenthal talked about, it's not the same,

431
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.910
but making sure that you make it a part of each day to connect with people,

432
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:53.540
even if it's through zoom can be a big part.

433
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.830
<v 3>Yeah. And also to, uh, you know, get creative,</v>

434
00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.170
don't stop using your brain. Like use this time. Don't just sit there,

435
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.260
pull the covers over your head,

436
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.850
like get out of bed and do something like learn poetry.

437
00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:12.080
<v 0>Write a book as, as, as Dr. Rosenthal talked about. And again, I know there's,</v>

438
00:27:12.081 --> 00:27:14.090
some people will say, yeah, easy for you. Uh, you know,

439
00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:17.000
I have these certain whatever everybody's situation is different.

440
00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:18.320
So you don't want to be, you know,

441
00:27:18.321 --> 00:27:21.290
sort of putting out like a one size fits all solutions.

442
00:27:21.291 --> 00:27:25.520
But the one thing that we can control are some of these things, exercise,

443
00:27:25.521 --> 00:27:27.320
how you eat, connecting with people.

444
00:27:27.321 --> 00:27:32.000
The other thing that I prescribed to people schedule laughing in your day,

445
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.780
meaning.

446
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.870
<v 3>Like real laughing or just like that fake laughing where people just go,</v>

447
00:27:35.871 --> 00:27:38.020
ha ha people do do that. Yeah.

448
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.060
<v 0>Talk about, I've been in yoga classes where people do that.</v>

449
00:27:41.061 --> 00:27:45.530
I was filled with rage. Now that's my own personal problems.

450
00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:47.030
Probably a little too much information.

451
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.760
It doesn't necessarily work for everybody, but for me,

452
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.740
whatever I'm going to be doing, whether it's working,

453
00:27:51.741 --> 00:27:54.470
whether it's doing these other things as part of your regimen,

454
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.010
I also schedule like watch whatever it is, something that, you know,

455
00:27:58.011 --> 00:28:02.090
is your go-to that you're going to laugh for half an hour, some stupid show,

456
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.250
dumb videos, whatever it is,

457
00:28:04.251 --> 00:28:08.360
but make sure you get that sort of going because it's actually literally,

458
00:28:08.361 --> 00:28:10.070
as they say, laughter is the best medicine.

459
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.210
<v 3>It is. And if you want to hear more of our conversation with Dr. Rosenthal,</v>

460
00:28:14.211 --> 00:28:17.510
and you're watching the video podcast on YouTube,

461
00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.600
maybe you're switching back and forth from a bunch of funny cat videos to get

462
00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:22.520
your laughing. Um, well,

463
00:28:22.521 --> 00:28:26.660
what you can do is you can click on the link below and go to the extended audio

464
00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:30.620
version. Now, if you're already listening to the audio podcast, uh,

465
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:31.401
we'll stick around.

466
00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:34.010
We're going to be back with more about health risks of isolation.

467
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.090
And we'll talk about your emotional intelligence with Dr. Rosen, salt Rosenthal.

468
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.550
So, um, don't touch that dial. Uh,

469
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.470
if that is all the time you have for us today. Well,

470
00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:45.050
thanks for watching and we hope you learned something.

471
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.640
<v 0>And we really do hope and we know it's tough. So obviously reach out to the,</v>

472
00:28:49.641 --> 00:28:52.190
what if discuss community on Facebook? Also,

473
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:54.350
there's a bunch of other people there. I mean, whoever,

474
00:28:54.351 --> 00:28:55.430
as he talks about whoever,

475
00:28:55.431 --> 00:28:58.430
whatever you got to find in terms of some group to sort of support you,

476
00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:59.773
you know, now's the time.

477
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.100
<v 3>Yup. Perfect. Thank you very much for watching. What if discussed?</v>

478
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:09.530
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
