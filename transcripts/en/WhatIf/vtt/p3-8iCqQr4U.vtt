1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.040
<v 0>Volcanic eruptions can last for weeks, months,</v>

2
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.660
or even years.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.130
This violent event is terrifying.

4
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:18.780
But what if another storm say a tornado

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.110
or a hurricane combined with a volcanic eruption?

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.660
Could it really happen?

7
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.290
How long would it last?

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.270
And if a volcano and a tornado combined,

9
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.120
what could it throw at you?

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.120
This is what if,

11
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.950
and here's what would happen if a tornado hidden active volcano

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.220
tornadoes only form during giant thunderstorms called super cells.

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.650
And according to George Karuna's storm chaser and host of angry

14
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:02.190
planet, super cells are already frightening.

15
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.640
<v 1>So the biggest storms on planet earth there,</v>

16
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.820
I've seen ones that have been twice the height of Mount Everest.

17
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.240
All of that energy rotating around produces torrential flooding,

18
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.780
hail to the size of baseball or larger vicious lightning.

19
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.200
And that rotation can come all the way to the ground and produce massive.

20
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:19.034
Tornadoes.

21
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.110
<v 0>Could one of these massive tornadoes strike an active volcano.</v>

22
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.810
Let's back up a bit. Before we get into the details,

23
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:34.280
we need to visit the basics for a tornado to happen.

24
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.770
You need just the right ingredients.

25
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.200
<v 1>When you're trying to forecast a tornado,</v>

26
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.940
you have to try and make a three dimensional picture of the atmosphere from the

27
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:48.170
ground all the way up, almost a space, the moisture humidity,

28
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.080
wind patterns, wind shear, all of these different ingredients.

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.880
And if something is off just ever so slightly, it just wrecks the whole recipe.

30
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.870
<v 0>So what are those ingredients? Well,</v>

31
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.580
first you need an updraft which can happen when cold air comes in and

32
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:07.310
shoves, warm air, higher into the atmosphere.

33
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.650
Then you need winds to change direction at different atmospheric Heights.

34
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.670
As the warm air rises, it starts to spin.

35
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.950
If there's enough spin,

36
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.590
then that column of air rotates until it makes contact with the ground.

37
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.990
And now you have a tornado

38
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.690
volcanoes form when magma escapes from Earth's core through a

39
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.170
crack in Earth's crust, in some volcanoes,

40
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.070
the magma is too thick and traps gas bubbles.

41
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.710
Eventually this creates so much pressure that the volcano blows its top.

42
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.470
But according to George, there is a lot less unknown about the earth score.

43
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.300
<v 1>If you were to shrink the earth down to about the size of an Apple,</v>

44
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.710
the crust portion would be about as thick as the skin.

45
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.020
And we have never gone deep enough to do more than even just scratch the surface

46
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.010
of that skin.

47
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.660
<v 0>Usually these two natural phenomenon don't happen in the same</v>

48
00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:20.010
geographical location.

49
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.760
There aren't many volcanoes in tornado alley after all,

50
00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:28.590
but there are places where the possibility of the two colliding become

51
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:29.670
more of a reality.

52
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.640
<v 1>Italy surprisingly gets quite a few tornadoes. As a matter of fact,</v>

53
00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:38.430
one was reported there just the other day.

54
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.320
So we've got a place you're in Europe,

55
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:45.120
where they get tornadoes from time to time and they also have

56
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.140
active volcanoes. Mount Etna is active all the time. Mt.

57
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:51.180
Stromboli is erupting today,

58
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.540
erupts every single day and has been doing so for 2000 years.

59
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.001
<v 0>All right.</v>

60
00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:01.860
So let's say that the largest tornado ever documented is going to hit

61
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.810
Mount Vesuvius, which is the volcano that destroyed the city of Pompei.

62
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.140
What would this catastrophe look like?

63
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.440
<v 1>So if you had a tornado that big,</v>

64
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.560
as strong as tornadoes get between 250 to 300 plus miles an

65
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:20.394
hour,

66
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.070
air starts to basically starts to act like a solid it's

67
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:27.600
so powerful.

68
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.320
So you take that and you combine that with a volcano.

69
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.090
<v 0>This tornado would pick up fire smoke and Ash from the volcano,</v>

70
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.940
creating a spinning vortex from hell.

71
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.680
<v 1>We've got sulfur gas. You have volcanic Ash,</v>

72
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.880
which is microscopic shards of assaulted glass,

73
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.860
just the Ash alone,

74
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.260
being whipped at those speeds would sand blast your skin completely

75
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:00.210
off of your body in seconds.

76
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.180
It's a level of destruction that is difficult for the human brain to

77
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.014
comprehend.

78
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.660
<v 0>But what about the lava lava is melted rock</v>

79
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.250
and it's three times denser than water. So it's quite heavy.

80
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.470
Different kinds of volcanoes. Eject lava have different thicknesses.

81
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.250
Mount Vesuvius is a straddle volcano,

82
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.960
which means it's made up of many layers of hardened, magma, volcanic,

83
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:35.460
Ash and material created from volcanic eruptions called TEFRA

84
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.850
strata. Volcanoes have slow moving lava that hardens before it spreads very far.

85
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.440
Unfortunately,

86
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.670
straddle volcanoes also tend to erupt violently.

87
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.100
<v 1>Through the eruption of the Soviets. Back in, back in Roman times,</v>

88
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.100
it was a plenty interruption was a style of rupture where you have these massive

89
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.240
explosions. You have rocks, you got chunks of lava.

90
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.520
Now they're being whipped around by 300 mile per hour winds.

91
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.620
So we're talking the worst place in the world to be.

92
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.430
<v 0>And that's not all like a fire tornado. Uh,</v>

93
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:25.600
love a NATO would spread hot Ash and magma over the surrounding area,

94
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.250
setting it a blaze golf ball sized hail debris and

95
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.270
hardened lava could rip through trees, buildings, cars,

96
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.910
its core could reach temperatures of 1093 degrees

97
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.090
burning. Anything. It touches to a crisp.

98
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.450
<v 1>Is possible that a tornado could strike a volcano. Like this would be this big.</v>

99
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:53.020
The odds are infinitesimally small, but it's not zero.

100
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.990
<v 0>Well that's good news. But what about a volcano? Creating its own tornado?</v>

101
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.780
Volcanoes are so powerful that they can create their own weather

102
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.730
as a volcano spews, hot gases and molten lava.

103
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.540
The surrounding temperature increases rapidly.

104
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.580
This forces cold air to rise and stretch out into a column,

105
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.550
creating a massive cloud formation.

106
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.010
Something similar happened in 2020 and the California wildfires.

107
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.330
I'll let George explain.

108
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.820
<v 1>During the California wildfires,</v>

109
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:35.590
we had an interesting situation where the fire was so intense

110
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.320
that the heat coming off of fire created an updraft that formed what we call a

111
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.570
pyro Cumulus cloud. The cloud grew so big. It turned into a thunder storm,

112
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:50.590
a pyro cumulonimbus cloud, and then it started to spin.

113
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.020
So now we had this super cell funder storm that was literally created

114
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.340
by the wildfire and that storm produced.

115
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:02.020
And do you have three tornado?

116
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.110
<v 0>So hypothetically something similar could happen over a volcano</v>

117
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.180
as it creates its own weather.

118
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:16.000
And if the wind over a volcano suddenly changes direction and

119
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.440
increases in speed,

120
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.510
the column of colder air could begin to rotate creating a

121
00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:26.800
tornado. Thankfully,

122
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.660
this destructive storm has a short lifespan like a normal

123
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:35.920
tornado. The lava NATO would only last around 20 minutes.

124
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.380
It would also have a limited range because it's created by the unique

125
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:45.910
weather hovering over a volcano. It wouldn't be able to travel very far.

126
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.610
Once the Lavin NATO moves away from the volcanoes hot gases,

127
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.140
it would start to break up,

128
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.090
but the fires had started would still be raging.

129
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.830
Okay. We've talked a lot about tornadoes and volcanoes,

130
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.300
but what would happen if a hurricane hit an active volcano,

131
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.210
hurricanes are much larger and longer lasting than tornadoes with a

132
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:17.070
horizontal reach of over 1600 kilometers and wind speeds up to

133
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:19.680
252 kilometers per hour.

134
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.900
It's much more likely that an active volcano and a hurricane would combine,

135
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.560
but surprisingly not much would happen other than the normal

136
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:33.330
destruction caused by hurricane.

137
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:38.100
That is because a hurricane is so much larger than a volcano.

138
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.980
They would have very little effect on each other.

139
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.290
If the active volcano is large enough and we're talking massive here,

140
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.630
it could make the hurricane bigger and stronger and the

141
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:56.340
hurricane could spread the volcanoes dangerous, volcanic Ash, further away,

142
00:09:56.341 --> 00:10:00.540
but that pales in comparison to the effects of a love of NATO.

143
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.390
There are about 1500 active volcanoes on earth and each of them

144
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.180
could create 11 NATO during an eruption.

145
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.270
And what's even more dangerous than a volcano creating a

146
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.580
lava NATO, all those volcanoes erupting at the same time.

147
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.720
But that's a story for another. What if

148
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:38.900
[inaudible].
