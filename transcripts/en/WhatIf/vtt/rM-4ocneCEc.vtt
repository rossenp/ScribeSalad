00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.030
<v 0>Is it a meteor shower space debris?</v>

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.740
No, it's something much, much worse.

3
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.210
Our nearest neighbor is a full moon. No more.

4
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.230
The moon exploded and splintered into millions of fragments.

5
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.040
Enormous lunar rocks are hurling toward earth.

6
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.700
Could this wipe us off the face of the planet?

7
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.630
How could the moon explode in the first place?

8
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.780
And if we do survive,

9
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.130
how would losing the moon change life? As we know it,

10
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.010
this is what if,

11
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.090
and here's what would happen if the moon exploded.

12
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.621
Okay.

13
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:56.480
So how on earth did the moon blow up a blast?

14
00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:00.050
Mining operation, gone wrong, a nuclear blast,

15
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.070
a collision with a rogue planet, whatever.

16
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.350
Cause this catastrophe you'd have to be packing some serious fire power to blow

17
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.300
up the moon guns,

18
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.820
the largest nuclear bomb ever built.

19
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.770
The SAR Bomba had the energy of over 57 million

20
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:25.640
tons of TNT. Think that's strong enough.

21
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.680
It's just a drop in the ocean compared to the amount of force you need to blow

22
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:35.630
up. The moon you'd need the power of over 600 billion

23
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:40.100
SAR Bombus to destroy the moon with anything less than that,

24
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.470
the moon would just crack into pieces and its gravity would pull it back

25
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:46.304
together again.

26
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.950
But if someone or some thing managed

27
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:53.090
to explode the moon,

28
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.200
it would spell bad news for us.

29
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.810
The moon debris would scatter across the solar system,

30
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.880
some into the abyss of outer space and some

31
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.860
headed straight for earth.

32
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.070
Earth's gravitational pull would immediately start to attract the moon rocks.

33
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.340
As the moon's remains, start to pick up speed.

34
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.280
They would come crashing down into the atmosphere.

35
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.290
Luckily most of the smaller debris would burn up before it reaches us

36
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.120
any larger pieces that got through would be traveling much slower than a similar

37
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:36.320
sized asteroid. The damage they'd cost wouldn't amount to much,

38
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.760
but is it just me or is it getting a little hot in here?

39
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.790
The moon chunks aren't causing much damage,

40
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.740
but the endless barrage of debris on our atmosphere would start to heat up the

41
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:53.210
earth. The whole world would start to get hotter and hotter.

42
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.860
Eventually getting to the point of incinerating all life.

43
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.730
Talk about a way to go. Oh,

44
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.960
and if you're thinking about trying to evacuate earth, you better do it.

45
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.520
As soon as possible. The moon debris combined with all the satellites,

46
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.350
it would destroy in space would make any trip out nearly impossible.

47
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.720
But what if you did manage to get out of Dodge or hunker down in the

48
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:24.580
deepest parts of the earth? What would life be like in the aftermath?

49
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.780
Well, for some of us, it wouldn't get any cooler.

50
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.830
The moon helps stabilize the Earth's actual tilt.

51
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.420
It's what gives us seasons with a new tilt.

52
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.900
Some parts of the earth could be constantly exposed to the sun.

53
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.700
In the worst case,

54
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.650
the polar regions could start rapidly melting raising sea levels

55
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.080
and drowning out parts of the world.

56
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.240
As the debris settles, the skies could look a little different.

57
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.990
The remaining moon rock might cluster around the earth,

58
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.210
forming a giant ring like Saturn,

59
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.970
but don't stop and stare too long. Every once in awhile,

60
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.790
some of the debris could rain down onto the earth

61
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.820
over billions of years,

62
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:17.320
the moon's gravitational pole slowed down the Earth's rotation,

63
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.580
giving us our 24 hour days without the moon,

64
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.860
the earth would start to rotate faster and faster. We'd have shorter

65
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.580
and stronger winds,

66
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.490
bird and insects would have a tough time surviving the harsh winds.

67
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.980
Not only that ocean tides would start to die down into tiny little

68
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:45.000
waves. The moon's gravity helps create tides on earth,

69
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.160
bummed out that you can't rip some gnarly waves anymore. Well, dude,

70
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.720
there'll be a much bigger problem.

71
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.390
It would wipe out all of the sea creatures that rely on the tides and ocean

72
00:04:57.391 --> 00:04:58.590
currents for survival.

73
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.790
Our whole world would be literally flipped upside down.

74
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.930
The earth would burn up. Our days would be shorter.

75
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.950
And the moon wouldn't be there to light up the night sky.

76
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.170
Now that we know how devastating it would be. If the moon exploded,

77
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.030
what if instead of having no moon, we had to,

78
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.910
well, that's a story for another. What if.
