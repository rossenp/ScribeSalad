00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.940
<v 0>Trickling water might seem harmless, even peaceful,</v>

2
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.030
but in the polar regions sound is a sinister

3
00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:24.350
warning of an event that could swallow up the Arctic landscape.

4
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.310
What would happen to the climate?

5
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.060
Why couldn't you eat fish anymore?

6
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.580
And how much carbon is stored in the Arctic?

7
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.630
This is what if,

8
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.340
and here's what would happen if the Arctic turned into a mega slump,

9
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.550
we've really done it. Now we ignored all the warnings.

10
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.050
We ignored science. We thought we had more time,

11
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.540
but now the permafrost in the Arctic is melting at an abrupt

12
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:06.770
thought, which means it's happening fast.

13
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.920
As it melts this formerly frozen layer of [inaudible] plant

14
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:17.390
debris will release a massive amount of carbon into the atmosphere.

15
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.490
And now, because of all that carbon, our time is yup.

16
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.580
Covers an area about twice the size of the United States.

17
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.920
It's created when Tundra plants like grasses and mosses die

18
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.240
instead of decaying and releasing organic carbon,

19
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.860
the plant matter is frozen into a layer of soil trapping,

20
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:49.280
the carbon dioxide and methane that would have been released.

21
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.830
If this important layer in the Arctic disintegrates,

22
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.780
it would be catastrophic

23
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.960
as permafrost melts the ice buried beneath the soil also melts

24
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.880
the draining water carries heat, spreading the dangerous stuff.

25
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.770
Tunnel and air pockets are created.

26
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.930
And the ground sinks into the newly empty caverns below Meltwater

27
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:21.470
and rain fill the dents, expanding them into lakes.

28
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.420
If hundreds of these happened at the same time they could merge.

29
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.970
This would create one giant mega slump where the Arctic landscape

30
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.833
used to be.

31
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.420
The more than 13 million people who live in the Arctic would have to flee

32
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.400
immediately 1500 billion,

33
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:46.130
tons of carbon would be released into the atmosphere.

34
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.070
That's three times the amount stored in the plant it's forest.

35
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.480
This is bad enough, but unfortunately,

36
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.800
we're now in a positive climate loop.

37
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.240
Ice only increases the amount of heat. The earth surface absorbs,

38
00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:08.100
which then melts more ice.

39
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.700
And this warms the planet.

40
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.750
Since the industrial revolution, humans have been releasing increasing Oh,

41
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.220
it's of carbon into the atmosphere and the positive feed back loop amplifies

42
00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:26.580
that effect as the ice melts,

43
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.660
the sea levels will rise, wiping out whole coastal cities.

44
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.100
And even if you don't live in the Arctic or on the coast,

45
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.290
you'd still have a lot to worry about climate change would come fast and

46
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:44.460
fiercely droughts would dry up someplace as well.

47
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.400
Others would face an increase in precipitation.

48
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.360
Storms would rip through the cities that are left

49
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.870
mercury from the melted permafrost would enter the oceans wetlands and food

50
00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:58.704
systems

51
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.740
wouldn't be able to eat fish anymore because they would have such high levels of

52
00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:05.850
this dangerous chemical

53
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.430
and the Arctic mega slump would never stop growing

54
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.380
more and more of the Earth's ground would become unstable

55
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.650
four people to flee South to higher ground.

56
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.120
According to the 2018 Arctic report card,

57
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.310
the Spanish flu smallpox and the plague could still be held in

58
00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:36.330
permafrost layers with the permafrost melted.

59
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.070
These diseases would be released and would spread rapidly among

60
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:45.600
densely packs cities. Like I said, in the beginning,

61
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.870
if the permafrost melts our time is up

62
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.270
in reality, mega slumps don't form overnight,

63
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:58.350
but while you might not wake up to one new giant mega slump,

64
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.270
they are happening.

65
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.310
The largest slump is in Barrigada in Siberia.

66
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.600
It's known as the gateway to the underworld.

67
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.720
It measures it's more than 900 meters wide and it's continuing to

68
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:16.554
expand.

69
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.180
And since the Arctic's temperatures have increased twice as fast as the global

70
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:28.440
average, these slumps are more likely to happen. Yeah.

71
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.230
Can we do to stop more mega slumps from?

72
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.380
Well,

73
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.760
our best option is to limit the amount of greenhouse gas released into the

74
00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:45.780
atmosphere while capturing carbon dioxide.

75
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.410
If we fail to do this,

76
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.600
then we'd better find a way to rephrase the Arctic before it's too late.

77
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.350
That's a story for another.
