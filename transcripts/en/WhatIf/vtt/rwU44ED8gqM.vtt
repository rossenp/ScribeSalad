<v 0>For over half a century,</v>

2
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.050
we've searched for radio signals from extra terrestrial,

3
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.220
civil [inaudible], but it's been well

4
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.220
, a little quiet. Are they ignoring us or have aliens already made contact without us knowing it? The truth could be hiding in plain sight. How has technology helped us look for extra terrestrial life? Could bacteria 

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.220
contain

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.220
 secret alien messages and whatever aliens already live among us? This is what if, and here's what would happen if we've already made first contact with aliens since the 1960s scientists at SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence have had their ears to the skies, listening for signals that could prove the existence of 

7
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.220
extraterrestrial

8
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.220
 life. Recently, bizarre and intermittent fast radio bursts were detected coming from a spiral galaxy like the Milky way, 500 million light years from earth. Some scientists wonder if these pulsating signatures from space are the result of 

9
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.220
mini black holes or pulsars or even alien mega structures, but could the

10
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.220
 signals actually be aliens trying to communicate with us scientists at Harvard 

11
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.053
theorized that the energy needed to send a radio signal to a disengage.

12
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.600
Aloxi would require a planet twice.

13
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:04.430
The size of earth covered in energy collectors while

14
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.510
it is possible.

15
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.010
Scientists have found an easier way for aliens to talk to us.

16
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.070
And according to Robert Zubrin,

17
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.380
it could involve teeny tiny stellar light sales.

18
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.290
This idea has been gaining enough ground that the breakthrough Starshot

19
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:28.610
project is working on nano spacecraft someday.

20
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.500
They hope to beam them all the way to alpha Centauri while

21
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.560
tiny spacecraft could travel great distances.

22
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.580
Bacteria could potentially survive the journey as well.

23
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.590
This is because it's easy for a bacterium to duplicate itself.

24
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.260
And as micro organisms,

25
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.560
they are small enough to overcome the gravity of stars,

26
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.090
making it possible for them to travel interstellar distances.

27
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.800
Hypothetically,

28
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.950
a microbial could be beamed from earth and travel a distance

29
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.300
of one light year,

30
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.020
every 10,000 years in 50,000 years,

31
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.970
it could reach nearby stars,

32
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.680
but why would aliens be sending us bacteria?

33
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.060
Well, the answer is in DNA.

34
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.130
Just one gram of bacteria could be encoded with about

35
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.280
900 terabytes of DNA data.

36
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.430
Imagine a 200 page book.

37
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.210
Now imagine 2 billion of these books.

38
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.750
That's how much data. In fact,

39
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.880
micro biologists think that alien messages may already

40
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.600
exist hidden in DNA here on earth,

41
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.340
waiting to be decoded.

42
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.980
Researchers suggest these messages could be found by determining which

43
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:58.240
bacteria could survive the conditions of space. In fact,

44
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.070
some astrobiologists on the ISS have experimented to see

45
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.780
if all life on earth could have come from extra terrestrial microbes.

46
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.780
This theory known as panspermia suggests that microbes

47
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.110
may have hitched a ride on comments that crashed into earth.

48
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.560
So like maybe where the aliens.

49
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.341
Okay. Okay.

50
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:28.080
But are we really alone while microbial alien

51
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:29.460
messages could exist?

52
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.080
We're still not sure what these alien messengers might look like.

53
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.180
We're mostly familiar with terrestrial life where all living beings are made

54
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:43.920
from cells using molecular machinery with most life here on

55
00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:48.630
earth being carbon-based. We might just be looking for the wrong kind of life.

56
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.610
Many biochemists suggest that Silicon based life forms could exist.

57
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.980
In fact, some scientists,

58
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.250
including British chemist in astronaut Helen Sharman,

59
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.310
suggest that aliens could exist in a place we cannot see or

60
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:08.520
study known as a shadow biosphere.

61
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.830
These invisible aliens could exist at a microscopic level

62
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.840
beyond our comprehension with recent UFO sightings being

63
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.610
declassified by the Pentagon.

64
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.470
Many people believe that aliens have already visited us

65
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.960
maybe in the not too distant future with the help of SETI

66
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.880
will finally prove we're not alone.

67
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.200
We're more on this tune into our,

68
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:45.150
what if disgust podcast this week we talked to Dr. Andrew Siemian

69
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.500
astrophysicist and director of the Berkeley SETI research center.

70
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.870
He'll join us for a deeper dive into the subject and update us on settees

71
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:59.100
progress in its comprehensive search for alien communication.
