1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>This substance may look like a liquid or gas,</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.630
but instead it's a solid,

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.240
this is Aero gel. The world's lightest solid,

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.670
this incredibly rare.

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.570
So [inaudible] has been used in spacecraft as an insulator,

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.680
but instead of using Aero gel for something useful,

7
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.550
why don't we fill up an entire pool with this stuff?

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.090
And then have you jump into it. One is Aero gel made out.

9
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.250
What would it do to your skin?

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.700
How much would this cost? This is what if,

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.530
and here's what would happen if you fell into a pool of Aero gel

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.530
before we fill a pool up with it,

13
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:55.370
we should figure out what Aero gel is. Exactly.

14
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.110
The Aero gel will be dealing with today is silica based.

15
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.250
Silica is made up of a variety of different chemicals,

16
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.080
which then make a gel.

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.390
And that gel is then put into a chamber where all the water is

18
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:16.100
extracted. And now we have our Aero gel,

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.380
but how much would we need to fill up an entire pool?

20
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.030
Well,

21
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.830
one of the scariest parts of this scenario is what making this much Aero gel

22
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.510
would do to your bank. Account.

23
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.880
Aero gel is made up of many different chemicals using various machines,

24
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.520
and it also takes a long time to produce because of all this it's

25
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:42.260
incredibly expensive.

26
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.050
The cost of Aero gel is about $11,500

27
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:52.280
per kilogram. That's more expensive than gold.

28
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:55.700
So if you want it to fill an entire pool with Aero gel,

29
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.550
it would cost you around $66 million.

30
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.590
And this is if you were to get it right on the first try,

31
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.970
after all making Aero, gel is a delicate process.

32
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.050
Part of the reason why it's so expensive and quantities are so low,

33
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:14.510
is that it's very difficult to make,

34
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.130
not to mention making this much Aero gel could take months,

35
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.350
depending on how much equipment you have for reference this small

36
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:29.000
brick of Aero gel took a week to create. So yeah,

37
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.190
expect to be pretty patient and rich to get all of this done

38
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.240
in a timely fashion.

39
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.300
And after weeks have gone by you'd finally have all the Aero gel

40
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:46.220
you'd need to fill up your pool since it would be even more expensive to

41
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:48.590
make one massive brick of Aero gel.

42
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.940
We opted for smaller chunks of the material. Okay?

43
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.900
Now that we have our pool full of Aero gel, it's time to jump in.

44
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.800
As soon as you jumped our pool,

45
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.930
it would feel like you're landing on something similar to a sea of styrofoam

46
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:06.550
peanuts. Remember,

47
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.560
although Aero gel might look like a liquid or a gas, it's really a solid.

48
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.030
This means you wouldn't be able to easily swim in this stuff,

49
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.830
but that doesn't mean you'd be completely stuck with all these blocks of Aero

50
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:21.730
gel in the pool.

51
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.960
Every movement you make would crush it into even smaller bits.

52
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.610
And it wouldn't take much effort to grind it up. Either Aero,

53
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:35.530
gel strength before it breaks is equivalent to crushing a piece of cereal

54
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.060
with your fingertips. Oh, Hey,

55
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.600
really grinding this stuff. It's pretty stale.

56
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.850
No chance of crushing it between my fingers.

57
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.510
I wanted to take a second to tell you about the sponsor of this video.

58
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.230
Hover hover is a great place to find a domain name.

59
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.640
They have over 400 domain name extensions. Sure. You can get.com,

60
00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:58.680
but how about.mom

61
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.250
or.beer or.football or.pizza?

62
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.940
I'm looking at setting up a website for my beef jerky business,

63
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.320
but I don't see dot jerky anywhere

64
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.400
yet. If you're building an online presence,

65
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.340
your online brand is important for its development.

66
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.020
You can get a great domain name and personalized email that matches your domain,

67
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:24.330
making the address that much more memorable.

68
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.050
Hover is so easy to use with it's clean user interface.

69
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.460
You don't know what you're doing. Well.

70
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.070
They feature a best in class customer support team.

71
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.210
There's never any upsells and best of all, you're not tied down.

72
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.250
You decide what to do with your domain.

73
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.850
You get the freedom to connect to any web host or site builder.

74
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.700
Check out hover.com/what if and get 10% off your first domain name.

75
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.430
So as you move through this pool, you'd be crumbling up the arrow gel.

76
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.650
The longer you stayed in, the more pieces would be pulverized. Luckily,

77
00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:02.430
while you perfect your backstroke, you'd be absolutely fine.

78
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.220
Aero gel. Isn't known to be toxic,

79
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.430
but try not to breathe in too much of the dust.

80
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:11.040
You'd be leaving in your wake just to be on the safe side.

81
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.100
Instead of going into your lungs, the Aero gel dust could stick to your skin.

82
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.870
And after some relaxing in the pool, you'd be totally covered in it.

83
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.940
Now would be the time to get out.

84
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.100
As you're taking a shower and trying to get the Aero gel dust off,

85
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.660
you notice that the water isn't touching your skin. Yeah,

86
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.400
your entire body would now be waterproof. Although you couldn't see it,

87
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.530
the Aero gel would be an invisible barrier between your body and the water,

88
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.020
but eventually some soap and some scrubbing would get your skin back to normal.

89
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.570
Jumping into this strange material might seem like a bad idea,

90
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:57.030
but the only long-term consequence,

91
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.930
it would be the damage it would do to your bank account. Finally,

92
00:06:01.931 --> 00:06:04.060
a scenario where you don't die,

93
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.050
but let's raise the stakes here a bit.

94
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.970
What would jumping into a pool full of stomach acid, be like,

95
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.670
well, we'll leave that story for another. What if.
