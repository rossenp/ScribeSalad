1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 0>I define myself as a cyborg because, um,</v>

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.390
am a cybernetic organism. Biologically,

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.810
I am merged with technology or with cybernetics. Uh,

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.370
but also because I feel that technology is part of my identity. So I,

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.740
I feel that I am technology.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.690
So I am psychologically United to cybernetics and also biologically United to

7
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.050
cybernetics. So I identify as a cybernetic organism.

8
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.410
<v 1>How would it feel to control objects with your mind</v>

9
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.900
or hear colors or maybe even live

10
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:48.740
forever? Well, if you want to find out,

11
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.340
all you have to do is become a cyborg.

12
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.870
How would being parked machine affect us?

13
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.640
Would it cause a greater divide between the rich and the poor?

14
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.110
And is this the next step in human evolution?

15
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.300
This is what AF wait to call this a,

16
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.280
what if is a bit misleading?

17
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.710
It's more of a when F because cyborgs are already among

18
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:23.450
us. And according to the world's first cyborg, Neil, Harveson,

19
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.280
they're not going anywhere.

20
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.590
<v 0>We will be able to decide which Oregon's or census we want to have as a species.</v>

21
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:35.300
And then whenever someone that has modified more

22
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:39.470
herself decides to have children, then we might stay the burst of

23
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.570
babies with sleep organs or census that their parents had.

24
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.580
So I'm sure we are of the very critical

25
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:52.250
moment of this century, where we'll start seeing this happening.

26
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.000
It's already happening by emerging with technology, but whenever we do this,

27
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.170
biologically, it will be a much stronger change.

28
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.700
<v 1>And that's not the only change we can expect with this technology.</v>

29
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.990
Artificial intelligence is becoming more advanced by the day.

30
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.270
Within the next 50 years, AI will be replacing most of our jobs.

31
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.330
They'll simply be better at them than we are.

32
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.850
Elon Musk thinks that for humans to avoid being reduced to the usefulness of a

33
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:27.620
house cat we'll need to augment ourselves to compete with

34
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:32.480
robots. Although according to our resident, cyborg Neil,

35
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.880
instead of fighting the inevitable robot takeover, we should embrace it.

36
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.880
But before we get to that, let's start making you a cyborg.

37
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.270
The first decision you'll need to make is what kind of changes do you want to

38
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:51.260
make to your body?

39
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.660
Do you want cybernetic eyes that allow you to see in black and white or CPI?

40
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.100
What about a chip in your hand that starts your car for you?

41
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.920
Or if you want to get crazy,

42
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.170
you could change your entire bone structure to be carbon fiber.

43
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.680
The possibilities are practically endless.

44
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.850
When Neil Harbisson decided to become a cyborg,

45
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.350
he wanted to view the world in a way it had never been seen before.

46
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.241
<v 0>Well,</v>

47
00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:25.200
I have an antenna implanted in my head that allows me to extend my perception of

48
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:25.710
color.

49
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.210
So the antenna allows me to sense from infrared to ultraviolet the

50
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:32.070
vibrations of color, enter the antenna,

51
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:36.080
and then the vibration of the color goes inside my spouse.

52
00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:40.500
So I feel color. I feel the vibrations of color, not only the visual spectrum,

53
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:45.120
but the infrared and ultraviolet, then there's also internet connection.

54
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:47.430
So I can also receive calls from other parts of the world.

55
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:49.470
So there's people that can send colors to my head,

56
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.470
or I can commit to NASA's international space station,

57
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:54.210
and then I can send colors from space.

58
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.060
So you aren't going to have internet connection,

59
00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:00.690
which I use to extend my perception beyond my body.

60
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.540
<v 1>Human augmentation will allow us to be better at almost anything that we do</v>

61
00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:07.350
now,

62
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.300
both physically and mentally imagine having mechanical arms,

63
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.320
you'd be shooting three pointers more consistently than Steph Curry.

64
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.720
You'd have a harder punch than Mike Tyson and a faster serve than Serena

65
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:22.554
Williams.

66
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.630
That's because your arms will be programmed to be more consistent and just

67
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.610
overall better than human components could ever be with two

68
00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:36.570
bionic arms. You'd be one of the greatest athletes ever to live.

69
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.420
Although if everyone had these arms sports might be more boring,

70
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.370
but don't forget. These arms can be used for several things.

71
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.930
Most importantly,

72
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.010
they may help us outwork robots in factories and other lines of work.

73
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.100
Many of us are afraid of the inevitable takeover of artificial intelligence,

74
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:02.670
but maybe we're just watching too many science fiction movies.

75
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.750
<v 0>Um, I don't think we should be scared of AI. I mean,</v>

76
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.050
if I ever becomes more intelligent than humans,

77
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.980
the mostly intelligence thing will be, they will probably,

78
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.840
AI will probably ignore us.

79
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:23.010
It won't either many people are scared that AI will kill us.

80
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.410
Killing us is something very human.

81
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:29.280
So killing humans is something that we already do so that wouldn't be more

82
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.080
intelligent than then human.

83
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.220
So AI ever becomes more intelligent than humans. I don't think they'll,

84
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.020
it will be dangerous.

85
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.910
<v 1>If you really want to see how this whole rise of the machines thing will play</v>

86
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:45.420
out. Maybe you can modify yourself to become immortal.

87
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.850
If you have a failing body part,

88
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.410
you could simply replace it with a mechanical one. And after it fails,

89
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.390
you could replace it again and again,

90
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.250
extending your life far past its expiring date.

91
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.730
But at this point you may barely be human.

92
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.230
The only organic part of you that might remain could be your mind.

93
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.730
Is it too late to go back? Unfortunately it is.

94
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.660
Once you become a cyborg, there's no turning back.

95
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.600
Even if you don't get any invasive surgery,

96
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.790
let's say you get an ear enhancement that allows you to hear as well as a bat.

97
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.630
If it somehow got damaged or fell out of your ear,

98
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.960
you wouldn't be able to hear it all. Why?

99
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.040
Because your brain would have adapted to hearing with your enhancement.

100
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.870
Once it's gone, you wouldn't know how to hear without it. Oh,

101
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.430
and don't forget about the chance of your body parts being hacked and then

102
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.970
losing control of them. Not only that,

103
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:49.610
but who will be able to get these enhancements.

104
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.090
Some people fear that they would only go to the rich causing further class

105
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:57.470
divide in our society.

106
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.880
But what if it's the complete opposite?

107
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.880
<v 0>People say that rich people will become sign, but it's not happening.</v>

108
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.770
It's the poor people that are becoming sidewalks.

109
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.890
Everyone that I know that has merged with technology is not rich.

110
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.220
They are students, uh, or they like myself. I, I did,

111
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.920
I had no money. I did it with friends. And really I'm not.

112
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.290
If you look at rich, people are not cyborgs. Uh, I believe, I don't know.

113
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.670
I can't think of anyone reached becoming a sideways it's people who are not

114
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:34.150
afraid of merging with technology that are becoming cyborgs.

115
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.040
And that has nothing to do with money.

116
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:40.840
You can become a sidebar for 20 cents and 20 cents. You can create, uh,

117
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.190
uh, infrared with a bit of, um, with a Matar and this,

118
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:49.120
we can install it at the back of your head and then you'll have retrocession,

119
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:51.250
you're getting a sense of what's behind you, but you're not.

120
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.310
I was thinking about money to gain a sense.

121
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.880
I think in most cases you can also have chips that, uh,

122
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.070
your cat or dog has. You can have it implanted, and it's not, uh, it's not,

123
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.040
it's not about money at least now.

124
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.460
<v 1>Instead of focusing on the potential negative consequences of becoming cyborgs,</v>

125
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.410
maybe we should start looking on the bright side as Neil harvest and explains

126
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.160
cybernetic modifications could help us save the planet.

127
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.290
<v 0>What we now call diversity has nothing to do with the diversity.</v>

128
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:29.020
We will see in society in the next few decades.

129
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:32.170
So we will see a diversity of species.

130
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.180
So we will be able to decide which organs and senses

131
00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:40.960
we want to have. And this will create a diversity, uh,

132
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.170
that we, uh, we have never experienced.

133
00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:47.350
So you will meet people with organs and senses that have nothing to do with

134
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:51.610
yours. And they'll have perception of reality that is different from yours.

135
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.950
But I think that's a thing that we should all start focusing on.

136
00:08:55.951 --> 00:09:00.240
We need to start changing ourselves instead of changing the planet.

137
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.140
We've been a species that for thousands of years have been changing the planet

138
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.400
and designing the planet in order to live better. And this hasn't been any good.

139
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.320
We've been destroying the planet this way. Instead of creating light bulbs,

140
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.100
we should have focused in creating night vision so that we don't spend so much

141
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:18.870
energy creating artificial light,

142
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.100
or if we could control our own temperature and find a way of controlling our own

143
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.400
temperature instead of creating heaters and air conditionings,

144
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:27.870
this would be much better for the planet.

145
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.090
We wouldn't change the temperature of the planet.

146
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.710
We would change our own temperature. So we need it.

147
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.720
We need to focus on designing ourselves if we want to continue living

148
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.230
in the planet without destroying it. And also whenever we do this,

149
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.240
we'll be able to do also live better because we have not

150
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:47.460
been able to adapt ourselves in our own planet.

151
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:50.550
So I think we need to start focusing on designing ourselves.

152
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.760
<v 2>Now, if we really want to reduce our impact on the planet,</v>

153
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:01.250
why don't we leave our bodies behind and upload our brains to the cloud?

154
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.280
Well, because that sounds like a story for another.

155
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:08.743
What if

156
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:18.800
[inaudible].
