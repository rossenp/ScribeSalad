00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>It can swallow entire Gazelles turtles and</v>

2
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:10.200
even lions. This is the Nile crocodile,

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.320
the most dangerous crocodile in the world.

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.000
It normally preys on animals found in Africa,

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.060
but now it's coming for you.

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.220
How easy would it be for this crocodile to swallow you?

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.400
What secrets lie in the crocodile stomach and

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.160
how would its heart help digest you?

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.220
This is what F and here's what would happen if you were swallowed

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.440
by a crocodile. If you think something like this is impossible.

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.240
Think again, crocodile attacks are more common than shark attacks,

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.850
and these attacks are responsible for nearly 1000 fatalities

13
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.713
a year.

14
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.280
So what would happen if you were one of these attacks,

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.680
would you be able to survive first?

16
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.520
Let's get to know a little bit more about this creature who's coming after you.

17
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.050
The Nile crocodile is typically found in Africa,

18
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.680
but has also been seen in Florida in the United States.

19
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.230
These crocodiles are incredibly aggressive and are responsible for over

20
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:26.810
300 attacks on people every year.

21
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.680
What might make it so aggressive is its size.

22
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.750
The Nile crocodile can grow up to six meters long and weigh up to

23
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:38.090
550 kilograms.

24
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.220
All this combined makes it the most dangerous crocodile on earth.

25
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.760
And now it's coming to swallow you whole

26
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.630
you'd first get attacked by the crocodile somewhere along a river.

27
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.980
And it's likely this would happen between December and may.

28
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.570
Since that's the crocodile's breeding season. As you're walking along the river,

29
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.130
the crocodile would stock you waiting for the perfect opportunity to

30
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:10.850
attack. You probably wouldn't even notice the crock.

31
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.600
And even if you did, it might be hard to get away from it.

32
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.460
As the Nial crock can run up to 18 kilometers per hour on land.

33
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.150
And as it caught up to you, it would strike it.

34
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:25.220
Your leg with its massive jaw,

35
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.640
applying 3,500 kilograms of pressure.

36
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.200
This would break your leg, preventing you from getting away.

37
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.810
And now the crocodile could drag you into the river where it likes to

38
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:39.860
do the rest of its eating.

39
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.530
Now that you're in the water with the crocodile biting into your leg,

40
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.110
it would begin to roll you around the water.

41
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.950
This is it attempting to disorient and drown you.

42
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.470
And at this point you'd be passed out. And now that you're not moving,

43
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.480
the Nile croc would swallow your body. Whole,

44
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.540
you would pass through the crocodiles esophagus and into its stomach.

45
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.243
<v 1>But wait.</v>

46
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.020
<v 0>This is a lot of food and not every animal would be able to eat something like</v>

47
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:18.220
this. So how can the crocodile, well,

48
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.830
the crocodile's stomach is unique.

49
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.780
That's because these creatures swallow rocks to help break up their food.

50
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.850
And that's why the crocodile didn't need to chew you while you're inside the

51
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.750
crocodile stomach. You'd be slushed by all these rocks.

52
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.400
And with that,

53
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.350
your body would be broken up into smaller chunks and rocks.

54
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.190
Aren't the only thing that would help the crock digest you inside the

55
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.570
crocodiles. Body is a heart valve that they control with their nerves.

56
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.240
Instead of this valve, going to the crocodiles lungs, it goes to the stomach.

57
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.310
This allows the crocodile to produce 10 times more gastric acid

58
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.970
and most other animals over the course of a week,

59
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.120
your body would be getting crushed up by all these rocks.

60
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:11.710
And you'd be getting dissolved by all the stomach acid, skin,

61
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.750
bones, hair, and all.

62
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.990
Then the crocodile would poop out your remains and go hunting for its

63
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:20.824
next victim.

64
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.590
So the next time your nearest swampy river watch out for crocodiles.

65
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.640
If you're not careful, they can be pretty dangerous,

66
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.200
but you know,

67
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:37.120
what's even more dangerous than a Nile crocodile terror Crocs,

68
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.610
but we'll leave that.

69
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.510
<v 1>Story for another. What if.</v>
