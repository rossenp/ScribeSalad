00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.970
<v 1>The titanosaur is no longer</v>

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.140
As the largest animal to roam the earth.

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.880
You think such an impressive presence would be almost invincible.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.370
How did this Titan of a creature finally meet its demise?

5
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.350
It seems even the mightiest.

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.393
<v 0>In fall.</v>

7
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.280
<v 1>Is a titanosaur.</v>

8
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.100
How did they end up on every continent?

9
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.010
And why did they disappear?

10
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.790
This is what if,

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.650
and here's what would happen if Titanic sores never went extinct.

12
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.020
Titanosaurs were part of a diverse group of dinosaurs called sauropods from the

13
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.700
Greek, meaning lizard foot.

14
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.500
Their enormous skeletal remains along with immense lizard.

15
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.900
Footprints have been found all over the world.

16
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.630
This global domination is both imposing and incredible.

17
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.210
So how did they end up on every continent? Well,

18
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.640
their extraordinary geographical distribution had to do with the splitting

19
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.500
of the subcontinent gun Dwana that took place at the end of the Cretaceous

20
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:34.334
period.

21
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.780
These long neck giants hitched a ride when this enormous landmass parted

22
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.260
and they lumbered onward to new Terrafirma.

23
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.960
The largest titanosaur was discovered in Argentina in 1987

24
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.280
appropriately dubbed the Argentina Saurus for this location.

25
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.310
They lived about 100 million years ago.

26
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.010
They were estimated to weigh up to 100 tons with a length ranging

27
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:03.260
between 30 and 40 meters,

28
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.450
and as tall as 15 to 20 meters, for some comparison,

29
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.630
picture the towering height of a seven story building,

30
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.760
or the great Sphinx of Giza throw in the mass of 12

31
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.490
Asian elephants or 2200 kilograms.

32
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.330
That's more than a Boeing seven 37 maximum takeoff weight.

33
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.610
And even the lengthy stretch of an official NBA basketball court at 29

34
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:32.570
meters would only hold three quarters of the creature's body

35
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.030
because of their massive size.

36
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:39.170
They were able to cover a lot of ground without moving excessively and expending

37
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:41.480
too much energy with top speeds,

38
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.740
averaging only around eight kilometers per hour, a social bunch.

39
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.450
They traveled in small hurts and needed to continuously be on the move to fuel

40
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:54.620
their gigantic appetites. So how did they die out?

41
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.880
Well,

42
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.760
their fate was sealed at 66 million years ago when asteroid struck the earth,

43
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.180
not only was this the end of the Titanic source,

44
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.050
but it also wiped out 75% of life on earth.

45
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.850
Yet if these Titans managed to write out changing times,

46
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.050
they would have needed to overcome several catastrophic global extinctions.

47
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.740
First they'd have to sidestep the asteroid that wiped them out.

48
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.420
Originally then persevere when global warming spikes global

49
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.670
temperatures, 55 million years later,

50
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.290
and also plow through the ice age 2.6 million years ago,

51
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.330
if they were here present day consuming so much plant life,

52
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.060
where would that leave us humans on the food chain,

53
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.940
evolving Titanic sores could deplete the ecosystem of vegetation

54
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.830
entirely and might be forced to become carnivores and adapt to their

55
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.780
ever-changing environment. Well, they may not become pure meat eaters.

56
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.610
They could become omnivores.

57
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.980
And if they developed a taste for meat who would be on the menu,

58
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.653
you and I,

59
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.150
this could create a scary ripple effect in the food chain and possibly cause

60
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:14.230
many species to die off. Since it's possible,

61
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.970
we could be considered prey. We would be forced to live in the tree tops,

62
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.590
maybe in a magical kingdom like indoor, maybe not.

63
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.890
Our new form of transportation could be the vines swinging from tree to

64
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:34.240
tree, like Tarzan to avoid the treachery if the open jaws below.

65
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.610
But what if humans were able to tame the tight

66
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.830
picture, happy, helpful. Titanosaur on a construction site,

67
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.340
working the ground look familiar,

68
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.500
or you could see them being useful and marching into battle like the heritage

69
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.090
rims on giant elephants and the Lord of the rings,

70
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.310
taking out everything in their path and imagine how many

71
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:07.230
mouths one of these giants could feed the titanosaur could become

72
00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:10.440
a source of food for humans and solve world hunger.

73
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.540
This might force them to flee land and head to the water,

74
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.370
living off a plethora of underwater Marine life plankton. Wait,

75
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.600
could it be possible that titanosaur is actually alive today,

76
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.100
hiding in the murky depth, Suffolk coast of Inverness, Scott,

77
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.350
perhaps sharing the water with another prehistoric behemoth,

78
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.560
the Moses Saurus. Well,

79
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.190
that's a story for another. What if.
