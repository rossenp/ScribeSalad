00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.190
<v 1>Energy drinks have a spectrum. There's this stereotypical energy drink.</v>

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.050
The one that people usually think of, which is high caffeine, high sugar,

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.730
and then there's the other end of the spectrum, which is green P E vitamins,

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.040
natural sweetener. And that's it.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.780
So it's very difficult to say all energy drinks are healthy or unhealthy.

8
00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:32.660
You have to look at the specific ingredients and the caffeine.

9
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.293
Peter.

10
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.570
<v 0>My name is Richard Garner and I am an energy drink</v>

11
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.433
alcoholic.

12
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.060
I was the youth always start off the show very dramatically with something like

13
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.400
that. I wasn't sure, uh, what was going to happen today,

14
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:07.880
but apparently today we're in the middle of an intervention is that I'm only

15
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.050
half kidding. I mean,

16
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:12.260
and I certainly don't want it to seem like I'm making light of the 12 step

17
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.240
program work, where people in a real, uh, you know, AA meetings,

18
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.510
whatever it, because the truth of the matter is by all definitions,

19
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.140
I would be considered addicted to energy drinks.

20
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:28.940
My day starts like starts when you say starts means like wake

21
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:32.780
up and like, I have literally crack a,

22
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.980
a monster red bull whatever's really on sale, to be honest.

23
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.640
Like there's no difference in taste two. There is, there is a different a taste,

24
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:43.080
but it tells you, it's not about the taste at the end. It's about this,

25
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:46.220
about the getting Jack does that, what were you saying? Well, it's about,

26
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.600
it's about yes, but waking up, I would say that is out of the ordinary.

27
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.830
And from all I've heard about energy drinks is a,

28
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.940
I've never had one myself. Wow. For years and years,

29
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:02.150
and years or cease to amaze, you had a single one you're waking, wake and bake.

30
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.050
Basically quick bake is a whole other show by the way.

31
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.240
But I would say if I was saying, I, I woke up and had a coffee right away,

32
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:13.460
you wouldn't think that's crazy. I wouldn't.

33
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:16.670
And I know what you're getting at because coffee is caffeine is a drug and

34
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.120
that's obviously, uh, you know, not necessarily good for you either,

35
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:24.560
but it's just a widely accepted coffee, tea, even beer and spirits.

36
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.220
It is. And we live in a world where again, it's,

37
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:31.520
it's not always just because it's legal, that it's right,

38
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.100
or just not a lot of people have studied this,

39
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:39.020
but thankfully our guest today has studied this because this is an area

40
00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:43.760
that I think is just emerging as something we need to understand more about, uh,

41
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:44.720
whether it's fatigue,

42
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:47.870
whether it's how people sort of manage stimulating themselves,

43
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:51.440
whether they should be at all. But that is why we were welcoming today.

44
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.970
Danielle Robertson, wrath, caffeine, scientist, author speaker,

45
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.340
and really one of the only people I know that studied this area as much as

46
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:01.420
pretty much anybody out there,

47
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:05.440
the author of are you a monster or a rockstar?

48
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.770
Danielle Robertson, wrath. Welcome to what if discussed?

49
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.220
<v 1>Thank you so much for having me.</v>

50
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.380
<v 0>So, I mean, I guess it's a,</v>

51
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.220
it's a fair question off the top because I think most people like Peter,

52
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.640
they default to energy drinks are bad. Yeah.

53
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.380
And most of the studies or articles you read, reflect that.

54
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.760
So they, they, they, but they usually are sort of combined with,

55
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.180
you know, if you're having six or seven a day or so,

56
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:36.930
let's just get started on that. Um, first question,

57
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.580
where do you fall on whether they're sort of healthy or not healthy energy

58
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:42.414
drinks?

59
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.990
<v 1>Well, that is a very tricky question.</v>

60
00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:50.400
It's tricky to say energy drinks are healthy or they're unhealthy for the same

61
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:50.791
reason.

62
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:55.710
It's tricky to say cereal is healthy or unhealthy on one side of the spectrum,

63
00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:58.290
you have lucky charms on the other side of the spectrum,

64
00:03:58.291 --> 00:03:59.580
you have raising brands.

65
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.300
And so energy drinks have a similar spectrum.

66
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.220
There's this stereotypical energy drink. The one that people usually think of,

67
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.440
which is high caffeine, high sugar.

68
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.150
And then there's the other end of the spectrum, which is green tea, B vitamins,

69
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.400
natural sweetener. And that's it.

70
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.140
So it's very difficult to say all energy drinks are healthy or unhealthy.

71
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:25.380
You have to look at the specific ingredients and the caffeine content.

72
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.840
<v 0>So as Richard, so helpfully pointed out off the top of caffeine, uh,</v>

73
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.970
from coffee, maybe, uh, just as bad, but, uh, you know,

74
00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:38.790
you mentioned green tea as being a good one. That's full of caffeine as well.

75
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.750
And coffee is the drink of choice for most people that I know at least on this

76
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:46.500
continent. Um, how did the two stack up energy drinks and coffee?

77
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.190
<v 1>Well, there's a lot of differences,</v>

78
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.500
which we probably don't have time to get into here,

79
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:56.220
but there's three key differences between coffee and energy drinks.

80
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.360
The first is that the caffeine content, isn't what you'd expect.

81
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.640
People that love their coffee sometimes look down on or worry

82
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:07.560
about people that have their energy drinks,

83
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.570
but a Grundy brew coffee from Starbucks is equal to

84
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:15.180
three red bulls grenade.

85
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.860
Coffee is the caffeine content of three red bulls. I'll give you another one.

86
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.730
One grand,

87
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:25.620
a pumpkin spice latte is about one can of monster energy

88
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.300
or one and a half red bowls.

89
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.350
So you really have to look at the caffeine content and not be focused on,

90
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:36.060
is it a coffee with a healthy halo or an energy drink with its negative

91
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.140
stereotypes? So that's the first difference the caffeine content.

92
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.790
The other thing is that energy drinks are really good about telling you how much

93
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:48.060
caffeine is in the container. That's part of their best practices.

94
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.870
It's really hard to know how much caffeine you're getting with coffee,

95
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.710
because it's a natural product. They don't have to label the amount of caffeine.

96
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.670
So it's very difficult to know how much caffeine you're getting.

97
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.350
And then the third key difference between coffee and energy drinks is what other

98
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:07.520
people are in that party. It's called the food matrix. So with coffee,

99
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:12.140
you're just getting caffeine and water and antioxidants with energy

100
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:16.310
drinks, you might be getting tarring B vitamins, glucuronolactone,

101
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.340
other ingredients. So you have to look at the whole picture.

102
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.960
You have to look at the whole food matrix and coffee because it's simpler

103
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.760
is often, but not always healthier because there's fewer things.

104
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.640
But if you're adding cream and sugar, that might not be true.

105
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.430
You have to look at every, every piece of the puzzle.

106
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.000
<v 0>Well like most things on the show or otherwise a little more complex than</v>

107
00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:41.170
initially thought,

108
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.760
we're going to continue with Danielle Robertson wrath, uh,

109
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.910
after the break more on what if discussed?

110
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.650
<v 2>What if disgust is brought to you today by keeps, you know, as guys,</v>

111
00:06:53.651 --> 00:06:56.140
so much of our identity is wrapped up in our hair.

112
00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:59.680
That's why as we get a little older and start noticing the first signs of hair

113
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:00.011
loss,

114
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:04.780
it definitely feels like panic time facing no guy is ever ready to go bald.

115
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:09.340
So thankfully there's now there's keeps the simple and easy way to keep your

116
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:09.910
hair.

117
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.000
<v 0>Yeah, the numbers are actually a little more startling than we might think.</v>

118
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:17.830
Two out of three guys experienced some sort of male pattern baldness

119
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.170
by the time they're 35 Pete.

120
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:23.080
So it's something you have to get on while you still have the hair.

121
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.150
<v 2>Well, you can get treated from home.</v>

122
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.910
You used to have to go to the doctor's office for your hair loss prescription,

123
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:32.260
but now thanks to keeps. You can visit a doctor online and get hair loss,

124
00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:34.210
medication delivered right to your home.

125
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.070
They deliver your medication every three months.

126
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:40.180
So you can say goodbye to pharmacy checkout lines and awkward doctor visits.

127
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.420
<v 0>And it is a long process,</v>

128
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.730
four to six months before you really start seeing the results.

129
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.390
But there's plenty of testimonials of people that are super happy with that and

130
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:50.470
are happy. They did it,

131
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.990
but you've got to get started because the sooner you start,

132
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:55.630
the more hair you keep for lack of a better.

133
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.860
<v 2>No, I love that. If you're ready to take action and prevent hair loss,</v>

134

136
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.260
<v 0>Welcome back to what if discussed. We are with Danielle Robertson, wrath,</v>

137
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.090
the author of, are you a monster or are you a rock star?

138
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.070
Is that right? Is that, did I get the title right? Daniel?

139
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.540
<v 1>Yes. Yes. Are you a monster or a rockstar guide to energy drinks?</v>

140
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.270
<v 2>And so it is a title by the way, it is.</v>

141
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.890
<v 0>Title, but it's also a helpful book in,</v>

142
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:34.990
in that this is an area that a lot of people don't really understand.

143
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:38.260
There is information out there. There's not tons of studies. Uh,

144
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.840
there's articles. You, you know, you talked off the top of,

145
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.000
most of them skew towards, they're not good,

146
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.190
but not surprisingly most articles about coffee skew towards that's good.

147
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.840
And we talked with Danielle in the first part of the show about, well,

148
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:56.910
some of that's also misleading more on that,

149
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.920
um, in the end, their, their delivery systems, right? I mean,

150
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:04.830
that's the one thing we haven't really talked about. It's whether it's coffee,

151
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.180
whether it's caffeine pills, uh, whether it's energy drinks,

152
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.280
these are systems that are designed to sort of deliver caffeine. Um,

153
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.830
does the science in the end support long-term moderated

154
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:21.780
caffeine use as healthy?

155
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.470
<v 1>Yes. Yes, it does. In fact, there was a giant,</v>

156
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.800
giant research paper. I mean, 50 bases,

157
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.690
a systematic review published in 2017 in the journal of food,

158
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.400
chemistry, and toxicology.

159
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.470
And they looked at decades worth of research on caffeine from

160
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.850
all different sources, coffee, tea, energy, drinks, food with caffeine.

161
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.890
They concluded what papers before them have concluded that if you stay

162
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.100
under 400 milligrams of caffeine per day,

163
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.570
then there's no increased risks for things like

164
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.860
cardiovascular effects, behavioral effects, reproductive effects,

165
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.880
or developmental effects. So that 400 milligrams is like the,

166
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.000
what do you call it? The pivot point on a Seesaw.

167
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.830
If you say below that the benefits of caffeine outweigh the side

168
00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:16.460
effects.

169
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.930
If you go over 400 milligrams of caffeine and you start having more side effects

170
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:22.040
than benefits.

171
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.940
<v 0>Interesting. Now,</v>

172
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.200
th this is ultimately probably more of a conversation about energy,

173
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.500
specifically stimulation is we're, we're all looking for stimulation.

174
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.370
And you know, this may come under the category of that's a story for another.

175
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:38.180
What if, but give us a, give us a picture about, uh,

176
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.190
the epidemic of fatigue.

177
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.490
What's what is your research told you about why we're so tired all the time?

178
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.790
<v 1>Well, there's two major causes of this increase in fatigue.</v>

179
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.960
The first one is our screens. We're looking at our screens all the time,

180
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.310
so that is messing up our circadian rhythm. That's the biggest,

181
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.510
the biggest reason.

182
00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:03.860
But the second reason is that as more and more products come out in the

183
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:07.550
marketplace with caffeine people aren't drinking,

184
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:12.530
or aren't consuming caffeine as strategically as they can. For example,

185
00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:14.480
we've been drinking coffee forever.

186
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.360
So the average person knows that coffee is good.

187
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.460
They know they drink it in the morning, it's fine,

188
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.810
but they might not be thinking about how that cup of coffee is sabotaging their

189
00:11:23.811 --> 00:11:28.340
sleep. And so they drink caffeine at 3:00 PM. They don't sleep well.

190
00:11:28.341 --> 00:11:32.540
They wake up tired, they need more caffeine. And it just it's a vicious cycle.

191
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.380
So I believe that that is what's happening. And in fact, um,

192
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.780
in Michael Poland's books, caffeine,

193
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.350
he makes the same exact mistake that a rookie might make.

194
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:46.700
He goes from having no caffeine whatsoever to having this very strong coffee,

195
00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:48.290
with extra shots of espresso,

196
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.970
that's equivalent to not working out for three years and then signing up for,

197
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.370
or for a marathon.

198
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.260
Like you need to be more strategic with how much caffeine you have,

199
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.250
how quickly you drink it and what time of day you're drinking it.

200
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:06.610
And I don't think enough people are doing that, which is why I do what I do.

201
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.690
<v 0>I enjoy a nice espresso after supper.</v>

202
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.090
I know espresso's got a little bit of less caffeine in it,

203
00:12:12.091 --> 00:12:15.180
but is that ill-advised like you're saying after 3:00 PM,

204
00:12:15.181 --> 00:12:18.810
I heard you say is that, is that sort of the cutoff time for drinking caffeine?

205
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.820
<v 1>That's what I recommend. Assuming that you have a normal schedule,</v>

206
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.560
you're not working night shift or anything,

207
00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:29.160
assuming that you go to bed around 10:00 PM or midnight,

208
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.310
you want to cut yourself off from caffeine around three,

209
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.930
because it takes three to six hours for half of that caffeine to leave your

210
00:12:36.931 --> 00:12:37.764
system.

211
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.790
So you want to give that caffeine enough time to be metabolized before you try

212
00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:42.624
and go to sleep.

213
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.830
And 3:00 PM is a good cutoff point for caffeine to leave your system.

214
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:47.791
<v 0>Well,</v>

215
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:52.500
a lot more to talk about a lot more to dive into pros and cons of energy

216
00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:56.580
drinks and caffeine use, uh, the management of it. Also,

217
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.970
I'd like to get into a little more about the brands themselves, you know,

218
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:04.770
which ones are quote, unquote, better, healthier if any of them are, um,

219
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.960
Danielle, can you stick around for a little more?

220
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.240
<v 1>So.</v>

221
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.410
<v 0>We are going to continue with Danielle Robertson, wrath talking, caffeine,</v>

222
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:17.550
talking energy drinks. Um, but, uh, for the,

223
00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:21.270
we'll talk a little bit about sugar too, and yeah, the, which is actually a big,

224
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.330
you know, sugar free or not sugar is also a big part of this is a good point.

225
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.710
Uh, but for the YouTube viewers, uh, where can they go? Well,

226
00:13:28.711 --> 00:13:31.860
if you're watching us on YouTube right now, there's a link right below.

227
00:13:31.861 --> 00:13:34.650
You can see you click on that and you can, uh,

228
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.190
get the extended audio podcasts where we'll have more with caffeine,

229
00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:40.530
scientist and author, Daniel Robertson, wrath.

230
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.220
If you're listening already on the podcast, there's nothing for you to do,

231
00:13:44.221 --> 00:13:48.540
just stay tuned. Um, and you'll hear the rest of us, but if you are leaving,

232
