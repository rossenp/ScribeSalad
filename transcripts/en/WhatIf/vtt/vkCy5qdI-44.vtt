00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>Is alien life really out there.</v>

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.900
Humanity has wondered about it for decades.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.480
And according to scientists,

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.600
it might finally be a reality.

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.380
Astronomers have discovered there could be life on Venus.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.610
Does this mean we finally meet aliens?

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.690
Could this help us discover other aliens?

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.280
And what does this discovery mean for us?

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.370
This is what F and here's what would happen if there's life

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.570
on Venus,

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.540
Venus might not be as alien as you think the

12
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:51.120
planet is roughly the same size as earth.

13
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:55.080
And its gravity is 91% of our planets.

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.220
We always talk about Mars being a potential home for humans,

15
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:01.830
but we shouldn't count out Venus either.

16
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.800
And if there is life on the planet,

17
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.630
could this speed up our process of making it our new home.

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.870
First let's look into why exactly scientists think there might be life on

19
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:20.070
Venus. It all has to do with phosphine.

20
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.290
This is a colorless, flammable and explosive gas.

21
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.060
That's also pretty stinky.

22
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.800
It smells like a mix of garlic and decaying fish.

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.180
This gas can be found on earth and it's dangerous to everything that uses

24
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:40.590
oxygen to survive.

25
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.400
It used as a chemical weapon during world war one and is a by-product of cooking

26
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.380
methods. Yeah,

27
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.210
this gas is not very pleasant and it can be extremely deadly,

28
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.860
but now astronomers have found that phosphine might

29
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:59.930
be in Venus's atmosphere

30
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.230
at first glance.

31
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.460
This might seem like a terrible thing because this gas kills anything that

32
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.623
breathes oxygen,

33
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.850
but that doesn't mean that life can't exist just because

34
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.200
something doesn't require oxygen doesn't mean it's completely lifeless

35
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.780
inside Venuses clouds of phosphene. There could be anaerobic bacteria.

36
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.580
These are organisms that don't require oxygen to survive.

37
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.680
They could be living on Venus producing this phosphine gas.

38
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.850
Keep in mind that all of this is not fully verified yet,

39
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.620
but astronomers have been keeping an eye on Venus for nearly all of 2020.

40
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.080
And this is what they think they've discovered.

41
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.260
So if this type of alien life really did exist on Venus,

42
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.360
what would it mean for us humans? Well,

43
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:58.490
when you first hear about alien life,

44
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:03.490
you think about Martians with big heads and us being able to shake their

45
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.900
hands, but that wouldn't be possible with these life forms on Venus,

46
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.550
as it stands right now,

47
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.780
we wouldn't be able to see any of the life on Venus with our naked eye.

48
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.690
It's all bacteria and microbes.

49
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.230
And with all that potential phosphene on the planet,

50
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.610
it makes visiting Venus more dangerous for humans than ever.

51
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.440
So will we be meeting this life form anytime soon?

52
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.600
Probably not.

53
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.320
Is this discovery still incredibly exciting? Absolutely.

54
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.380
And sure. It's discouraging that we haven't found Martians yet,

55
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:49.320
but try not to be too disappointed when discovering potential

56
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.160
alien life,

57
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.930
we should remember to expand our ideas about what exactly these

58
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.460
alien life forms could be.

59
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.620
They don't necessarily have to be something with two or four legs that humans

60
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:06.120
are able to interact with the possibilities for potential alien life

61
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.960
are endless things we can't even imagine yet.

62
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.840
And who knows what this current life form could turn into. It may start small,

63
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:17.670
but in millions of years,

64
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.230
we might see Venus bloom into a planet full of organic life

65
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.350
and life on Venus might not be limited to organisms living in phosphine

66
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:28.741
gas.

67
00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:33.630
Either experts think that due to all the extreme climates on the planet,

68
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.330
life could form almost anywhere.

69
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.110
And that goes for the rest of the solar system too,

70
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.740
with scientists discovering potential life on Venus,

71
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.840
who knows what else is out there?

72
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.410
Researchers will just have to keep searching to find out.

73
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.990
Speaking of researchers,

74
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.970
one of the lead scientists who made this exciting venous discovery is on this.

75
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.530
Week's what if discussed?

76
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.870
We sit down with Dr. Sarah Seager to talk about how she found this potential

77
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:08.670
life on Venus and what exactly it means for other life in the solar

78
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:10.440
system. Check it out.
