00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>Hundreds of meters underground</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.560
enough to house tens,

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.690
to hundreds of thousands of people and walls strong

4
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:15.230
enough to withstand the force of a nuclear blast.

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.690
These are some of the world's deepest and largest bunkers,

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.870
but even in an apocalypse,

7
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.850
you wouldn't be completely safe in one of these earth,

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.470
penetrating weapons, like the 1.2 mega ton B eight,

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.120
three warhead can demolish bunkers 300 meters deep.

10
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.860
What would it take to build a deeper bunker?

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.820
What would life be like inside it?

12
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.700
And why can living underground be dangerous?

13
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.520
This is what if,

14
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.600
and here's what would happen if we built the world's deepest box,

15
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.370
the deepest hole in the world,

16
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.410
the Cola super deep borehole penetrates about 12 kilometers

17
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:13.760
deep into the earth surface in comparison,

18
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.590
underground bunkers are usually built at much shallower depths.

19
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.440
One of the deepest bunkers in the world,

20
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.420
the Cheyenne mountain complex is only about 610 meters

21
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.480
deep. So what's the problem.

22
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.780
If we can dig thousands of meters into the earth,

23
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.500
what's stopping us from making a bunker just as deep.

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.620
The truth is we do have the tools and technology to build the world's deepest

25
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:43.454
bunker.

26
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.410
The only other things we'd need are lots of time and money,

27
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.450
lots and lots of money.

28
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.230
As we dig deeper and deeper,

29
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.350
the soil pressure will continue to increase.

30
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.420
It'll become expensive and difficult to keep the hole from collapsing.

31
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.254
In on itself,

32
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.720
we could use sheet pile walls to support the soil pressure they're

33
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:13.370
commonly used in construction and excavation, but the deeper we dig,

34
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.250
the harder it is to construct the walls.

35
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.980
Another way we could work around this is to dig narrower and narrower.

36
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:23.840
As we reached the bottom of the hole,

37
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.290
it would look similar to an open pit mine.

38
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.920
The soil would be stable without the need of any support.

39
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.080
Then all that's left is to build the bunker right in the middle of the hole and

40
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:39.410
fill it back up afterwards. Sure. It'll be safer,

41
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:43.130
but ridiculously pricey and time consuming.

42
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.380
Some of the most expensive bunkers cost millions of dollars to build.

43
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:52.880
So it's safe to say that building the deepest bunker could

44
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.650
easily cost a fortune,

45
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.090
but what if we had the money and resources to build the bunker?

46
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.430
What would life be like if we had to stay down here

47
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.940
now don't be expecting a five-star bed and breakfast.

48
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.280
You'll be surrounded by thick, tightly sealed concrete walls.

49
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.390
So no gas, water or radiation can get through.

50
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.880
And before you get settled in,

51
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.260
you'll need to make sure that the bunker has a reliable power source

52
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:28.200
underground, a good filtration system,

53
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.650
and an ample supply of food and water.

54
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.380
The food down below in the bunker,

55
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.660
wouldn't be much different than what astronauts eat up above your

56
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:43.980
diet would consist of dehydrated or freeze dried foods to prevent

57
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:48.600
spoilage and to save space that is until hydroponic

58
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:49.650
farms can be built.

59
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.050
This is what farming could look like in an underground bunker instead of

60
00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.370
soil and sunlight.

61
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.590
Some hydroponic farms use nutrient rich water and artificial light to grow

62
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:03.540
plants. Not only that,

63
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:08.310
but by using aquaponics fish and plants can be farmed

64
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.173
together.

65
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.980
Even indoors eating fish can help provide us with an essential

66
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:17.190
nutrient that will definitely be lacking underground.

67
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.090
Vitamin D sadly, if you're living underground,

68
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.600
you won't be able to get under the sun and work on your tan,

69
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:28.530
but there are much bigger problems. You're going to have to worry about.

70
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.760
Most of the vitamin D we get is from the sun.

71
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.110
We need this vitamin to keep our bones strong and healthy

72
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.900
ultraviolet a and ultraviolet B rays from the sun are also essential

73
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:45.780
so that we can make vitamin B in our bodies.

74
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.000
It helps boost our immune system and it keeps us happy and energized.

75
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.070
Ooh, a lack of sunlight can cause other health problems too.

76
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.250
It can cause seasonal affective disorder,

77
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.470
a type of depression that occurs in fall and winter when there's less light.

78
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.970
The sun also helps to keep our circadian rhythm and check

79
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.310
it's the body's internal clock and helps to regulate our sleep

80
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.530
patterns. Without the sun.

81
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.600
People in isolation have slept as much as 48 hours at a time.

82
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.630
Maybe we could use led lamps to provide artificial sunlight and

83
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.340
a diet with a lot of vitamin D rich foods. Okay?

84
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.800
Now that everyone has enough food and light,

85
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.930
there's one more important thing that we'll need to take care of the

86
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.400
community with everyone's lives confined to the bunker.

87
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.940
Staying connected will be ever so important.

88
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.650
You'll need to rely on other people. As you adapt to this new lifestyle,

89
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.090
creating a normal life in the bunker where kids go to school,

90
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.800
adults go to work and each person has their own room.

91
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.960
Can help everyone adjust building the world's deepest bunker might keep you

92
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.300
safe from what's happening on the surface,

93
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:13.220
but making sure everyone is healthy underground is just as important.

94
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.721
All right,

95
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.230
now that you know what it would be like in the world's deepest bunker.

96
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.600
What if we built the world's tallest tower one that reached

97
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.540
outer space? Well,

98
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.440
that's a story for another. What if.
