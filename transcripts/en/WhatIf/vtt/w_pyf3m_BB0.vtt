1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Would you go to space? If you had a chance,</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.000
would you still do it? If the spacecraft was an air balloon,

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.690
I'm talking a really big one.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
What kind of training would you need to complete before you went up there?

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.840
How high into the atmosphere would you get and what are

6
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:28.320
the chances of getting whisked into space?

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.230
This is what if,

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.150
and here's what would happen if you wrote a balloon to space

9
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.490
travel three times faster than normal

10
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.210
helium also makes air balloons float up in the air.

11
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.300
It's kind of a big deal because of how rare and nonrenewable

12
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.380
this gas is.

13
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.330
That's why the air balloon that would take you to space.

14
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.670
Wouldn't be filled with helium. It would be fueled by another gas,

15
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:17.490
with a similar effect, hydrogen,

16
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.000
and it would be the experience of a lifetime.

17
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.151
<v 1>But in essence,</v>

18
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:28.040
what we do is take a capsule up with a balloon and big enough to float on

19
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:32.990
top of the Earth's atmosphere and then float there for a few hours

20
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.410
and then gently float back down, uh,

21
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.310
and splash down in the ocean to get picked up. Uh,

22
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.770
just likes up like the space X capsule bus.

23
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.410
<v 0>Okay. Wait, I didn't know. You could get to space so easily,</v>

24
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:52.940
but that's the concept that's being developed by a company called space

25
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:57.410
perspective and we've got their founder and co CEO

26
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.060
Taber MacCallum on the line.

27
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.110
<v 1>So space perspective is developing spaceship, Neptune,</v>

28
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.550
which will take eight people and a pilot to sort of the,

29
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.290
essentially the edge of space,

30
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:14.240
about 30 kilometers or 20 miles up using a huge

31
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.580
balloon, the size of a football stadium.

32
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.580
<v 0>I don't know about you, but I'm sold.</v>

33
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.910
If you've always dreamed of seeing the North pole,

34
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.300
this might be your chance to take a cruise above it,

35
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.740
or maybe you've always wanted to look at clouds from high above.

36
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.020
Take a good long look.

37
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.490
Maybe you'll see the world's number one cloud business system.

38
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.630
Hey everyone, I'm Peter. And this is Richard and we're on the set of our,

39
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:43.070
what if discussed podcast?

40
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.910
Because we want to bring you a message from our friends@netsuite.com. Yeah.

41
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.270
If you're a business owner, it doesn't matter what type of business necessarily.

42
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:51.104
I mean, you could be,

43
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.650
could be flying people to the stratosphere and a balloon balloon to the

44
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.350
straightest ship. We're not going to tell you how to run your business,

45
00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.800
cause we're not business experts and this isn't business show.

46
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.460
But what we can tell you is you might be making it harder on yourself than it

47
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:04.900
needs to be. Yeah, that's right.

48
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.650
So don't let QuickBooks and spreadsheets slow you down anymore.

49
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:10.540
It's time to upgrade to NetSuite,

50
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.050
stop paying for multiple systems that don't give you the information you need

51
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:18.760
when you need it. Like Pete said, it's 20, 21. Get rid of the old spreadsheets,

52
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.010
get rid of the old school, outdated software,

53
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.770
upgrade to NetSuite by Oracle.

54
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.640
It's the world's number one cloud business system. Yeah.

55
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.810
NetSuite gives you control and visibility over your financials,

56
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.070
your HR,

57
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:37.540
your inventory e-commerce and more it's everything you need all in one

58
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.100
place instantaneously,

59
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:42.790
whether you're doing a million dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars in

60
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:46.630
revenue, save time and money with NetSuite. Yeah. And it's tried and true.

61
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:48.070
It's not sort of out of the blue,

62
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:52.480
there's already 20,000 people on the NetSuite cloud. So you won't be alone.

63
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.760
It's not brand new. It's been around for a long time.

64
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.510
Let NetSuite show you how they'll benefit your business with a free product to

65
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.140
her@netsuitedotcomslashwhatifscheduleyourfreeproducttourrightnowatnetsuite.com

66
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.830
slash what-if that's netsweet.com/wooded.

67
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.660
All right, let's get back to our balloon adventure.

68
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.940
Before stepping into this craft, you'd want to know all the ins and outs.

69
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.750
And we're about to tell you how this would play out

70
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.310
three hours before the flight you'd arrive at the launch site and get a

71
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.200
training session with your instructor.

72
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.060
So no excruciating workouts prior to the launch,

73
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.210
not even a diet change, nothing.

74
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.780
<v 1>There's very few physical requirements. Uh,</v>

75
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.200
there may be an age limit for minors, um,

76
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.280
but we haven't found a practical upper age limit. Uh,

77
00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:54.930
we had some questions about an 86 year old woman a little while ago.

78
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.370
And, uh, our, our doctors said she's good to go. Uh,

79
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:02.880
so if you can do a commercial airline flight, you can do this.

80
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.930
<v 0>Pew. That's some good news from Mr. McCallum.</v>

81
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.020
That's a level of preparedness I could handle.

82
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.920
And while you're walking around in excitement,

83
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.270
the launch team would take their positions and perform the final checks.

84
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.000
The launch team would unfold a giant deflated balloon on a protective

85
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:29.940
mat. I know it would be hard to resist,

86
00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:33.360
but try not to touch the balloon just to see how it feels.

87
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.610
You don't want to accidentally scratch it.

88
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.750
The crew would initiate inflation.

89
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.760
They'd be pumping in one ton of hydrogen gas into the balloon.

90
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.460
This would take awhile. Finally,

91
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.560
you'd step into the pressurized cabin of the space ship Neptune and the

92
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:58.910
200 meter tall. What lift off.

93
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.650
<v 1>You fly a wrong pocket to orbit.</v>

94
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.240
Then you're going so fast that you essentially keep missing the earth.

95
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:10.210
So you're always sort of flying around the earth.

96
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.350
If you go up on a Virgin rocket or a blue origin, rocket,

97
00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:18.160
you go up and then sort of parabolically fall back down.

98
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.160
And what we do is we go up and then sort of float there slowly and then

99
00:06:24.161 --> 00:06:25.570
gently come back down.

100
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.940
So a big part of that experience is actually the slowest scent and slow

101
00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:35.740
decent. So when do you talk to like a pilot or even an astronaut?

102
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.890
You know, the, the getting into orbit part are they getting into space?

103
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:40.120
Part is so fast.

104
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:44.830
You don't really have time to understand sort of mentally grasp what's going

105
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:49.720
on, but we take two hours to get up there. We're going at 12 miles an hour.

106
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.320
And this is like bicycling speed to the edge of space.

107
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.060
<v 0>You wouldn't be alone on this oversized hydrogen filled balloon.</v>

108
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.590
You cheer the cabin with a pilot and seven other passengers,

109
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.050
and you'd be riding in luxury. The cabin would feature huge windows,

110
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:12.010
comfortable seats bathroom. And of course a bar,

111
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.230
it could be the perfect romantic getaway with a great view

112
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.460
at 19 kilometers an hour, some two hours later,

113
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.260
the balloon would take you to the altitude of 30 kilometers above the earth

114
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:33.160
surface. You'd cruise around for the next couple of hours.

115
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.600
Take in the sights from the stratosphere. It would look gorgeous up there,

116
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:40.510
but that's not exactly going to space.

117
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:43.480
Is it stratospheric balloons?

118
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.420
Like the one carrying you aboard the space ship?

119
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:50.410
Neptune can only reach Altitude's of up to 50 kilometers.

120
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.960
That's only halfway to the point where technically space starts.

121
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.440
<v 1>The way buoyancy works is that, um,</v>

122
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.540
the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the earth is higher than the

123
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:06.610
atmospheric pressure, a foot above it,

124
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.580
which is higher than the atmospheric pressure, a foot above it.

125
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.730
And so as you go higher, the atmospheric pressure gets lower.

126
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.460
If you make a balloon and you,

127
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.440
and you make that volume less dense than the

128
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:22.630
atmospheric pressure around it, that says,

129
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:25.420
so we do that by filling it with helium or hydrogen,

130
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.220
essentially what's happening is the atmospheric pressure at the bottom of the

131
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:35.200
balloon is pushing it up because it's less than atmospheric pressure at the

132
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:36.160
top of the balloon.

133
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.500
<v 0>But this big balloon could only get so high before it becomes</v>

134
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:46.450
heavier than air and its buoyancy wouldn't be enough to push it

135
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:47.290
up. Any higher.

136
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.660
That limit would be somewhere around this Mark where it's too high for

137
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:56.550
commercial airplanes, but way too low for rockets and satellites.

138
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.210
It might not be outer space yet,

139
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.130
but it would be high enough to see the earth magnificent curvature

140
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.113
in all its beauty.

141
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:14.340
After a few hours of enjoying the view, you'd start to descend back to earth.

142
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.180
Your pilot would begin slowly releasing the hydrogen.

143
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.400
After two more hours,

144
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.990
the crew would deploy a parachute and safely splashed down into the ocean.

145
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.730
Shortly after the landing, a ship would pick you up. Oh,

146
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.320
and that would cost you $125,000.

147
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.560
<v 1>The market demand looks so huge that I think we're going to be operationally</v>

148
00:09:39.561 --> 00:09:43.010
limited for all space companies together,

149
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.960
but we are looking at ways to bring that price down

150
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.820
over time. I think, you know,

151
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:53.540
certainly getting to half that price in time is possible.

152
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.790
And then it's becoming sort of a lifestyle change question for a lot of people,

153
00:09:58.791 --> 00:10:02.210
you know, do I get that new car, that bigger house,

154
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.800
or do I decide to go?

155
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.940
<v 0>If you were determined to ride a balloon all the way into space,</v>

156
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.450
you could bring jet fuel hijack the spaceship,

157
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.130
Neptune and use rockets to launch the balloon from the stratosphere all the way

158
00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:23.150
up to space. Well,

159
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.270
you wouldn't make it very far into outer space.

160
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.160
It's not that easy to break free of Earth's gravity and leave the earth orbit.

161
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.750
So no danger of that happening, but if your rocket suddenly malfunctioned,

162
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.720
you'd be toast. You know,

163
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.730
there are other ways you could travel into space without jumping into a rocket,

164
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.890
but that's a story for another. What if.
