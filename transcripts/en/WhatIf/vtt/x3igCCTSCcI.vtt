00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 0>Forget everything you know about the United States of America,</v>

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.200
it's not United anymore,

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.910
but divided into several independent nations.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.620
No, this isn't the result of a divisible election.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.580
This is what America's borders would look like.

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.240
If it were never stumbled upon by Christopher Columbus,

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.780
what would this mean for the indigenous populations that already lived there?

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.620
Could they have become a global superpower?

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.720
And how would this impact the development of Europe?

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.690
This is what if,

11
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
and here's what would happen if Columbus never discovered America

12
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.053
in school,

13
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.260
most of us are taught that Christopher Columbus discovered America in

14
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.530
1492, but in reality,

15
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.630
there's evidence that the Vikings and the Polynesians were there hundreds of

16
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.720
years before. And most importantly,

17
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.910
we can't really say he discovered anything when there were already millions

18
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:15.900
of people living there,

19
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.630
but Columbus arriving in America did spark massive amounts of

20
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:26.400
exploration and colonization that led to the world as we know it.

21
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.870
So if he never arrived in America,

22
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.170
would colonization still have happened

23
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.920
before we go too far down the alternate history route,

24
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.340
let's set a few real historical facts straight.

25
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.980
First off before Columbus arrived,

26
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.650
the Americas were not just sparsely populated Wildlands with tribes

27
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:58.590
wandering through them. Instead,

28
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.300
there were actually more people in the Americas living in complex and highly

29
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:06.060
organized societies than there were in Europe.

30
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.970
All of the communities had rich and mature cultures and established

31
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:12.804
languages.

32
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.880
There's even some evidence that indigenous populations of North and South

33
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:22.740
America occupied the region for about 20,000 years before

34
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:26.280
Columbus arrived. Since time immemorial,

35
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.230
they had diversified so greatly in terms of culture that they spoke

36
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:34.170
approximately 300 different languages,

37
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.450
but that all changed when Columbus and the European colonizers

38
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.284
arrived.

39
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.670
A study from England university college London found that the European

40
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:52.530
colonization of the Americas indirectly contributed to the deaths

41
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.430
of 56 million people by the year 1600,

42
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.990
the study attributes to the deaths, two factors, including introduced disease,

43
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.850
such as smallpox and measles,

44
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.360
as well as warfare and societal collapse.

45
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.800
If the Americas had never been colonized by the Europeans,

46
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.740
not only would many lives have been saved,

47
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.850
but also various cultures and languages through

48
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:23.230
colonization, the indigenous populations were labeled as Indians.

49
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.090
They were enslaved and they were forced to abandon their own cultures and

50
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:32.920
convert to Christianity. If it worked for this oppression,

51
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.630
the indigenous nations would have continued to develop and progress.

52
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.700
Modern day, California would be the most densely populated region,

53
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:49.990
but the entire continent would be divided into different nations,

54
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.640
much like Europe and Asia,

55
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.950
smaller tribes would get swallowed up by larger ones and borders would continue

56
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.300
to change throughout history.

57
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.880
But one group that may have emerged as a dominant culture over the

58
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.980
others would be the Iroquois.

59
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.110
They were known as one of the strongest nations due to their successful

60
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.700
agricultural practices and their ability to invade other nations.

61
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.260
If Columbus hadn't brought colonization over to the Americas,

62
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.240
then the Iroquois would probably have continued to grow their nation

63
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.590
and surround much of the great lakes area and the Mississippi river

64
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.920
and our geographical borders.

65
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:35.950
Wouldn't be the only things that would look different in this alternate

66
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:36.784
timeline.

67
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.010
Our diets would to wheat would not have been a staple in the American

68
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:46.960
continents as this is something introduced from Europe and

69
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.910
American foods like corn,

70
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.990
tomatoes and potatoes would not have been introduced to the Europeans.

71
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.950
But in all honesty, even if Christopher Columbus didn't sail,

72
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.300
the ocean blue America would likely have still been invaded.

73
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.450
The age of exploration beginning in 1450 had many nations

74
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:14.170
looking for new lands to conquer and goods to exploit.

75
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.220
So eventually someone would have stumbled upon it.

76
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.210
Nowadays, the only new worlds to be discovered are in outer space.

77
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.150
If we find one we can live on,

78
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.510
let's take a lesson from our history here on earth.

79
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.710
If someone already lives there, let's just leave them alone.

80
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.500
But that's a story for another. What if

81
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.680
[inaudible].
