00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>Coca Cola can do some pretty strange things.</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.680
And the ingredients inside of it might be even more bizarre.

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.920
Just imagine what it's doing inside your body after you drink it.

4
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.130
Now, let's take that one step further and imagine only drinking

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.320
Coca-Cola for the rest of your life.

6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.540
What affects does Coca Cola have on your body?

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.600
What would this do to your teeth and how

8
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.690
bad would replacing water with Coke?

9
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.730
Be this is what F and here's what would happen

10
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.710
if you only drank Coca Cola, believe it or not.

11
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.660
Someone has done something like this before a woman in Monaco

12
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.860
stopped drinking water and only drank Coca-Cola for

13
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.900
16 years straight.

14
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.930
Did she survive doing this to her body?

15
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.520
And what would happen if you did the same?

16
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.570
Doctors recommend that people shouldn't drink anywhere from three to four liters

17
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:19.490
of water a day. So instead, we're going to replace that with coconut Cola,

18
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.760
a single can of Coke has 39 grams of sugar to get

19
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:27.380
your daily fluid intake.

20
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.460
You'd need it to drink over eight cans of Coke each day,

21
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.600
that's 312 grams of sugar.

22
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.970
It would be like eating six chocolate bars for

23
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:41.690
reference.

24
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.400
It's recommended that people consume less than 40 grams of sugar every

25
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:48.290
day. So, yeah,

26
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.210
this would be a lot of extra sugar not to mention the extra

27
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.920
calories your coconut take alone would be nearly an

28
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.650
extra 8,000 calories a week,

29
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.270
but that wouldn't be all the extra calories. You'd find soon.

30
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.910
This sugary drink could also cause you to eat more as well.

31
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.180
And with all these extra calories,

32
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.000
it would lead to some serious weight gain.

33
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.670
As you drank more cope, tooth decay would also be a severe issue.

34
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.030
Each sip of Coke would cook your teeth,

35
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.600
tongue and gums for hours after you finished your soda,

36
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.520
unless you stuck to an incredibly strict toothbrushing schedule,

37
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.150
the sugars would slowly break down your enamel.

38
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.040
This could eventually lead to your teeth, completely rotting.

39
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.790
And once you're done drinking your sodas for the day,

40
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.490
expect to be going to the washroom a lot.

41
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.750
The caffeine and Coca-Cola is a natural diuretic,

42
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.630
meaning that you're going to be peeing a lot more,

43
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.940
but the caffeine would be the least of your worries.

44
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.400
One of the main ingredients you'd need to worry about is the high fructose

45
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.900
corn syrup. That's because our bodies don't metabolize it.

46
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.080
And this could lead to a fatty liver

47
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.430
dumps of a fatty liver include fatigue and pain in the upper right

48
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.660
abdomen. As you continued to drink Coca Cola,

49
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.660
you would experience even more health issues.

50
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.180
You might have frequent fainting spells and have a potassium deficiency

51
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.590
due to all the sugar, caffeine and other chemicals.

52
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.350
You'd also experienced problems with your heart rate,

53
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.420
but the issues won't stop there as time goes on.

54
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:49.830
You'd also have a massive risk of getting type two diabetes

55
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.710
and loads of vitamin deficiencies.

56
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.050
And if all these issues continued and you decided to ignore them,

57
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.420
you could develop proteinuria, which could then lead to kidney problems.

58
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.900
And after years of only drinking Coke,

59
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.240
you'd eventually be 600 pounds with a huge list of health

60
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:13.074
issues.

61
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.090
You'd take your final sips of Coca-Cola and then die due to a heart

62
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.600
attack, kidney failure or other health-related issues.

63
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.260
But it doesn't have to be like that.

64
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.070
Remember the woman who drank Coca-Cola for 16 years,

65
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.720
she had a lot of the same issues you had with fainting and weight gain.

66
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.200
But after 16 years of only drinking Coke,

67
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.910
she decided to stop.

68
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.160
And her body bounced back to a relatively healthy state in a short period of

69
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:44.994
time.

70
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.430
So you might be able to do this for over a decade without experiencing any

71
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:51.780
severe repercussions,

72
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:56.370
but although drinking only Coke for a week a month or

73
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.870
even a year, wouldn't kill you. It doesn't mean you should do it.

74
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.850
Another thing you shouldn't do jump out of an airplane without a parachute,

75
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.050
but luckily with our new show, how to survive,

76
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.310
we'll show you the perfect way to make sure you get out of it alive.
