00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>Monday Tuesday, Wednesday,</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.220
Wednesday, Wednesday, again, Wednesday.

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.470
I feel like we've done this before Wednesday.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.580
Does anybody else notice this Wednesday? How do I break this time?

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.493
Lou,

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.130
could you tell if you've been living the same day all over again,

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.300
how many times did today really happen?

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.130
And if you were trapped in a loop, how would you get out of it?

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.070
This is what if,

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.420
and here's what would happen if you got stuck in a time loop,

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.500
you know, that feeling of deja VU,

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.540
when you just know you've seen this happen before now,

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.660
imagine if your entire day is a big deja VU moment and then

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.510
tomorrow, and then the day after tomorrow,

15
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.380
nobody seems to notice it, but you,

16
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.750
what would you do to break the cycle and what would happen

17
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.920
if you died? I understand you've got a lot of questions,

18
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:11.570
but before we start,

19
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.530
I'd like to introduce you to some mind blowing science

20
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.150
as weird science theories often do this.

21
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.050
One starts with Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.

22
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.260
Basically the idea is that the three dimensions of space and a dimension of

23
00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:34.790
time are joined together in a continuum called time.

24
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.840
Gravity can bend this spruce,

25
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.980
which theoretically makes time travel possible.

26
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.920
That is if you have access to a big enough black hole or to a time

27
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:53.660
machine, like a tickler cylinder, we included instructions on how to build one.

28
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.620
In another video,

29
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.790
you might want to check that out without getting into too much detail,

30
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.080
a time machine,

31
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:04.700
like a tickler cylinder could create a closed timelike curve.

32
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.300
In this system. A particle could go back in time to where it started.

33
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.060
We don't understand quantum physics enough to know if these closed timelike

34
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:21.650
curves could or couldn't exist. But for the sake of this scenario,

35
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.840
we'll assume they are possible and are a result of time folding

36
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:31.280
upon itself. What would this mean for you?

37
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.450
Well, for one thing,

38
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.340
you could travel back into yesterday and start your day all over again.

39
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.530
In that case reliving the same day. Again, wouldn't be surprising to you.

40
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.520
You'd be in control of when to go back to the future.

41
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.240
And if you die during one of those travels,

42
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.340
you wouldn't wake up in your bed the morning before that would be the real

43
00:02:58.341 --> 00:02:59.174
end for you,

44
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.940
but you wouldn't be restricted to only going back to yesterday.

45
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.360
You could travel back to the time when you were born.

46
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.940
Take a heck of a trip down memory lane,

47
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.910
no matter how far in the past you went, you wouldn't change it in any way.

48
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.640
You wouldn't create any paradoxes like killing your yesterday's self or

49
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.140
whatever else you might come up with. Ironically,

50
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.960
what's preventing you from creating any time.

51
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.560
Paradoxes is called a predestination paradox

52
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.210
in a closed timelike curve. When you travel to the past,

53
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.410
you've always been part of that past your presence. Wouldn't change a thing

54
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.320
at the same time. If you find yourself reliving yesterday,

55
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.030
that could mean that somebody put you in a time machine and sent you one day

56
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:56.530
back. In that case, you should just go on with your day till it's over.

57
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:59.290
And the next day you'd be living in tomorrow.

58
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.480
If you want to geek out on time-traveling, here's some food for thought,

59
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.100
maybe closed timelike curves, aren't closed at all.

60
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.170
What if instead,

61
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.340
an alternate timeline would appear every time you traveled to the past,

62
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.100
then you'd continue living in an alternate universe and you wouldn't be able to

63
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:25.780
go back to your original one unless you open some kind of portal to a

64
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.670
parallel world. But that's a story for another one. If,

65
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.650
and if you want to learn more about time loops and closed timelike curves,

66
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.600
check out our, what if disgust episode, where we welcomed Danny Rubin,

67
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.100
the screenwriter of the ultimate time loop movie Groundhog day.
