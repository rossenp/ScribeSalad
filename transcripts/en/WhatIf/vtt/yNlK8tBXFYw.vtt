00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.030
<v 0>[Inaudible] do you hate spiders?</v>

2
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.100
<v 1>Oh, the baby's coming out of it. Oh,</v>

3
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.220
their legs, their eyes and, um, men,

4
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.770
their webs. Well,

5
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.990
it turns out that they don't like you much either imagine that you've stumbled

6
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.790
into the belly of the beast. And now you're trapped in the sticky,

7
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.210
horrifying webs of a giant spider.

8
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.210
Just how strong is this stuff?

9
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.360
Do you have any chance of breaking free or are you

10
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.120
going to become the spiders next meal?

11
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.240
This is what if,

12
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.770
and here's what would happen if you got caught in a giant spider web,

13
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.090
it looks like you've gotten yourself into a sticky situation.

14
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.170
Spider's webs are not something to take lightly,

15
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.660
especially if you're caught in one.

16
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.780
Each strand of spider silk is 1000 times thinner than a strand of

17
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:15.614
human hair.

18
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.570
And each strand of silk is made up of thousands of nano

19
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:25.550
strands, which are 10 to 20 millions of a millimeter in diameter.

20
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.300
And they're very, very strong.

21
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.400
I know what you're thinking. 1000 times thinner than hair.

22
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.773
<v 0>Please.</v>

23
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.430
<v 1>Laugh it up now because if we extrapolate this information to a human</v>

24
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:53.810
sized spider, a big enough web could snack a jetliner.

25
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.440
Talk about ordering delivery. Spiders,

26
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.710
use their silk for making webs, protecting their offspring.

27
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:05.060
And as a way to escape predators and above all for

28
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.370
catching and wrapping up their prey,

29
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.160
orb webs contained several different kinds of silk and make webs that are

30
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:14.360
strong and rigid.

31
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.640
The silk is produced in different glands and has different characteristics

32
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.640
depending on what the spider needs. For example,

33
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.770
if the spider wants some building material,

34
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.450
it will use its major ambulant plan for capturing food.

35
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.110
It would use its flagella forum silk glands to build the trap.

36
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.220
The spider then covers it with a sticky glue, like coating.

37
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.500
The glue is both viscous and elastic and very,

38
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:45.170
very hard for food to escape from.

39
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.420
And I'm sorry to say that in this case, the food is you.

40
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.330
So let's break this down on a scale of spiderweb to,

41
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.430
Oh no, I'm going to be spider food.

42
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.850
Let's say you only got an arm stuck in a massive web. Well, in this case,

43
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.320
you're very likely to escape. This is because you can just cut your arm loose.

44
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.230
If both of your arms get stuck,

45
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.480
we hope you're flexible enough to use your legs to separate at least one hand

46
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.314
from the web.

47
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.210
It's also worth noting that now would be a good time to lose your jacket shoes.

48
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.120
And even your pants. If they're attached to the web,

49
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.540
Don't want to wait around and see what's coming.

50
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.170
But what if you weren't so lucky?

51
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.860
What if you managed to get completely snagged?

52
00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:42.030
And the homeowner of this web of death is lurking nearby.

53
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.660
Well, you're not going to like this next bit of advice,

54
00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:48.450
but you got to trust me on this. I mean,

55
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:50.190
it's not like you have many other options.

56
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.440
You want to make a fuss and attract the spider over to you. Wait,

57
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.980
don't go hear me out. I know it sounds insane,

58
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.110
but it may just save your life.

59
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.990
If you're wrapped up like a pig in a blanket,

60
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.580
you'll want to wiggle scream and essentially have a tantrum. Now,

61
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.650
the spider is going to notice this as their webs are basically built with motion

62
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:14.484
sensors,

63
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.440
your goal would be to make yourself seem like they're too big or too dangerous

64
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:23.730
to be spider food. And if the spider thinks that you're not worth the trouble,

65
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.450
it'll cut you loose. This plan is based on research.

66
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.400
Showing that putting up a fuss is the only way to escape scientists

67
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:33.840
at the university of long duress.

68
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.670
Say that staying active is the best way to get free from a spider's web.

69
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.650
This is why we see some daring escape artists in the world of insects.

70
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.930
Well, that's the plan anyway, because it may backfire.

71
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.880
If the spider thinks you look tasty well, it'll just wrap you up even more.

72
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.230
This will completely restrict your movement and well,

73
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.690
things won't work out for you.

74
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.450
You're either going to be eaten or die of dehydration or starvation from

75
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.780
being in the web for so long. Thankfully,

76
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.280
we live in a world where natural spider webs aren't capable of catching a human

77
00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:15.870
being. That is,

78
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.060
unless we artificially engineer sound or find ourselves with

79
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:23.190
a sudden case of giant spiders.

80
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.060
But what if the roles were reversed?

81
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.660
What if you didn't get stuck in a spider's web,

82
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.780
but a spider got stuck in you.

83
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.020
What if a spider crawled into your body? Well,

84
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.830
that's a story for another. What if.

85
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.030
