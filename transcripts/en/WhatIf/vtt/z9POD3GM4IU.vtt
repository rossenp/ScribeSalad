00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.860
<v 0>On average,</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.990
100,000 Americans are wounded by guns. Every year,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.300
scientists have developed something that could prevent gunshot injuries from

4
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:15.180
happening Bulletproof skin.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.740
What if you replaced your skin with this material,

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.910
what is Bulletproof skin made of?

7
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.290
What do goats and spiders have to do with this?

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.240
And could this be the solution to gun violence?

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.300
This is what if,

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.830
and here's what would happen if your skin were Bulletproof?

11
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.830
It's no secret that bullets are incredibly powerful and dangerous.

12
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.270
A bullet can move up to 2,500 feet per second.

13
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.070
With this speed,

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.230
it can make its way through walls metal and of course human skin.

15
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.400
So if we wanted to make ourselves Bulletproof,

16
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.560
what exactly would we need to do? Well?

17
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.020
Let's take a look at the scientists who made the.

18
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.140
<v 1>First Bulletproof piece of skin.</v>

19
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.090
A Dutch research team created the skin using spider silk.

20
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.820
Well sort of since.

21
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.830
<v 0>Spiders don't produce a lot of silk, it's incredibly difficult to farm it.</v>

22
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.690
So instead,

23
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.850
these scientists use CRISPR technology to make goats produced Sprite.

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.863
<v 1>Your silk.</v>

25
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.130
<v 0>They spliced the spider silk gene with goat DNA.</v>

26
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.650
And when that goat had a baby,

27
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.050
that goat was able to produce milk containing the spider silk proteins.

28
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.180
And with that, the researchers were able to produce enough spider silk,

29
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.220
which they combined with human cells to make Bulletproof skin.

30
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.860
They found that this piece of skin could stop a bullet,

31
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.790
but only if it wasn't traveling at full speed,

32
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.440
it's all thanks to the incredible strength of the spider silk.

33
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.930
This protein is three times stronger than Kevlar and five

34
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:19.280
times stronger than steel.

35
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.850
So although these initial Bulletproof skin tests didn't stop a bullet at

36
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:26.750
normal speeds,

37
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.450
let's assume that they've improved the technology and it can stop bullets

38
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:33.284
with ease.

39
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.670
What would happen if it replaced your regular skin?

40
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.980
This Bulletproof skin might not feel much thicker than your regular skin

41
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.710
that's because spider silk is 1000 times thinner than a strand

42
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:52.790
of human hair. And when combined with our human cells,

43
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.450
this new skin would feel just like your normal skin,

44
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.870
but it would definitely act differently with Bulletproof

45
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:05.860
skin. Our bodies wouldn't be able to be penetrated by firearms.

46
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.540
If all humans had this kind of skin, this would prevent thousands.

47
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.120
If not millions of deaths worldwide,

48
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.400
if this type of skin became a normal genetic modification,

49
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.010
it would most likely be given to the rich and powerful. At first presidents,

50
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.340
Kings and Queens would all have this type of skin,

51
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.760
keeping them safer from assassination attempts.

52
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.700
Next on the list would be military and police officers with Bulletproof

53
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:41.350
skin. They no longer need to wear Bulletproof armor or protective equipment.

54
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.270
This would save millions of dollars and it would make them more agile on the

55
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:50.380
battlefield injuries and death for soldiers could be

56
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.030
significantly reduced,

57
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.160
but that doesn't mean that Bulletproof skin would be perfect.

58
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.460
Sure. Your skin would be impenetrable,

59
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.400
but you'd still feel the impact of the bullet.

60
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.950
Getting hit by a bullet would at best feel like the hardest punch you've ever

61
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:13.600
felt. And at worst, it could easily break your bones.

62
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.540
So don't go running around thinking you'd be invincible.

63
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.260
And with this in mind,

64
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.670
Bulletproof skin probably wouldn't affect gun violence either.

65
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.380
In fact, it might make it worse. Instead of shootings,

66
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.300
there could be an increase in bomb attacks and who's to say

67
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:39.190
that manufacturers wouldn't just make more powerful guns to be more deadly.

68
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.170
They could develop weapons, powerful enough to penetrate Bulletproof skin,

69
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.600
making it completely pointless.

70
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.890
Bulletproof skin might sound like a great idea,

71
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.610
but it wouldn't make much of a difference when it comes to violence.

72
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.340
Maybe being a single worldwide country could help us find peace.

73
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.770
Well, that's a story for another. What if

74
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.300
before you go onto your next hypothetical adventure,

75
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.560
I want to show you something we're really excited about this. My friends is the,

beautiful printing paper.
