00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>What has Joel McHale done?</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.280
Now? I feel like you're accusing me of murder.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.360
You're saying something like that.

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.460
<v 1>What have you done?</v>

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.550
<v 0>Hey everybody. It's me. Joel McHale. Today.</v>

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.100
I'll be doing the wired autocomplete.

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.360
<v 1>Sweet interview.</v>

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.980
<v 0>Here we go. Guys. Why Joel McHale.</v>

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.990
Why? Joel McHale tiger King. Why not?

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.980
Well that fell into my lap because Ted Sarandos, basically, it was just like,

11
00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:38.570
do you want to host the up special?

12
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.550
The tiger King and COVID it was just as though it was like the week after it was

13
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:45.860
all locked down, you know, it was when you thought, well,

14
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.000
if I look at someone weird,

15
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.640
they're going to get COVID or maybe I'm going to get COVID if I look at them too

16
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:50.420
long, I don't know.

17
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.210
So I got to host that thing and it's it's I know it's a part of the actual

18
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:56.690
series, but I had nothing to do with it. I barely, I showed up,

19
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.500
I hadn't recorded somethings. I did talk to those people for a very long time.

20
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:04.310
So even though that special is like 33 minutes long or something,

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.720
I talked to each of them for like two hours. It was, it was exhausting.

22
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.700
I don't know how I do it. I don't know. We almost got Joe exotic,

23
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:17.780
but the prison or the jail he was in, uh,

24
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.170
got a COVID scare. So that went away very quickly.

25
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.720
Why is Joel McHale famous?

26
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.930
That is a good question.

27
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.760
Why is Joel McHale podcast? Why,

28
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.960
why do we do a podcast? Uh, Ken is one of my good, good, good friends.

29
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:39.740
If not one of my great friends, you know, I'm joke, but he's a real doctor.

30
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.981
I mean,

31
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.130
he really knows what he's doing and I would call him and ask him about the

32
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.410
virus. And he, we kind of were like, Hey,

33
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:47.030
we should do a podcast and talk about this.

34
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:51.680
And then we'll talk to our friends after that. And so that's how that started.

35
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.290
And Ken knows what he's talking about.

36
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.450
I just read articles and then pretend to know what I'm talking about. Uh,

37
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.850
some publicist called me and be like, um,

38
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.740
we would like to put our client on your podcast.

39
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.410
Can you please give us the name of your Booker? And I'm like,

40
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.430
you're talking to them and, uh, and, or Ken, or where are the bookers?

41
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.260
So Ken's been, you know,

42
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.890
on the most successful shows on TV right now with the masked singer and I can

43
00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:20.720
see your voice and all the other ones. Uh, and, uh, so now I think he,

44
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:24.680
that has kind of like he's he's he's, uh, he's got a little more free time.

45
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.090
How Joel McHale, here we go.

46
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.170
How tall Joel McHale.

47
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.620
Well, I think everybody knows I'm eight foot one,

48
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.400
but that's just the lower half. It's very long. I am six, four.

49
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.660
How old is Joel McHale? I am 48 years old.

50
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:49.280
So I could be your dad in a lot of cases. Your granddad. So, yeah.

51
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.240
So you know, let's see some respect 48. Yeah.

52
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.950
Not for much longer next week. No, two weeks. I'm 49. I'm 49. Uh,

53
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.060
how does Joel McHale

54
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.680
stay in shape? Thanks for saying that. That's right.

55
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.720
I'm doing an AB workout right now. So I do like 40 minutes a day.

56
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.810
Sometimes if I got a little more free time, I'll do an hour,

57
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.680
but I try to carve out and was like, dude, you take days off. I'm like,

58
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.320
I do not. I try to get it in every day.

59
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.610
Somehow I want to eat spaghetti carbonara for every meal.

60
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.100
But if you operate at a caloric deficit, you'll not even stay in shape.

61
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.050
You'll look like you're in shape. Thank you.

62
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.440
How much does

63
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.500
Joel McHale make for card

64
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.640
sharks? How much money do I make for card sharks? Oh, well, yeah. Well,

65
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:48.760
that's how I might get paid. I have to play the game myself.

66
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.000
So some weeks I'm making like over him,

67
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.810
half a million dollars other weeks gift certificate. So,

68
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.180
but I just have to go out there and turn the cards over myself.

69
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.630
And then the producers always, you know, like, come on, dude, keep going.

70
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.960
You're you, you gotta, you gotta for up there. It's gotta be higher.

71
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:09.280
And then like, Oh, we're so sorry. We're so sorry. We're so sorry.

72
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.680
And now a kombucha break. I'm kidding.

73
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.500
This is chilled red wine. Does Joel McHale. There we go.

74
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.070
Does Joel McHale leave community? No,

75
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.900
I mean, I did. I stayed with it all six years. Other people left. Um,

76
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.800
but I certainly didn't. Wait. Did I? And it's still going.

77
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.530
Is that what happened? Does show still on?

78
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.510
Does Joel McHale have lions? Yes. Um, um,

79
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.370
because I was paid in big cats for the tiger King special.

80
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.570
Does Joel McHale have a brother? No, I don't.

81
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.220
I have two brothers. Ooh. And people like,

82
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.990
Oh, um, are you the oldest? And I'm like, no, the youngest, no. I'm like,

83
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.090
I'm the middle. And they'll go like, totally. It's why I became an actor. Right.

84
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.520
Cause you,

85
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.060
you just needed the attention and he doesn't mean you're the middle man.

86
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.310
What are you talking about? Yes, because if I had been the youngest one,

87
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.760
I would have to have been a pilot. Their names are Chris and Steven.

88
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.150
We look alike. Okay. Uh, does Joel McHale

89
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.150
play accordion? It's not play the accordion.

90
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.350
It's play accordion. I do not play the accordion. I don't play any instrument.

91
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.330
Bang. Joel, these are all blanks. This is Joel McHale.

92
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.370
And then just blanks. Joel McHale. The soup. Oh,

93
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.070
takes you back. Doesn't it? Yeah,

94
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.570
that was the thing that helped me get the audition for, you know,

95
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:51.310
like a zillion. Like I, um,

96
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.300
I did not expect that I was going to be a host at all in my career.

97
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.020
I think everyone thought I was the next, you know, Joel Edgerton. No. Um,

98
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.320
I stumbled into that job and got very lucky because a couple of,

99
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.700
a couple of executives that he decided to take a shot and it, we, boy,

100
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.140
that's 2005. Geez. I didn't have a child then or no, no.

101
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.550
He didn't even have a child then. Yeah.

102
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:17.650
Those were the days I got to do that for 12 years. A really fun Joel McHale,

103
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.600
drag race. Wow. Oh yes. I loved being a judge.

104
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.830
I think Michelle wanted to rip my head off Michelle and I are friends. Okay.

105
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.230
We had a very fun time that show's amazing.

106
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.120
And the amount of work the performers put in is staggering.

107
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.030
And like the changes they have to make. It is remarkable. Joel McHale,

108
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.750
Joel McHale dog, no three, three dogs. I got a French bulldog,

109
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.360
a pug and a thing called a [inaudible]

110
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.360
. The French bulldog is a maniac and an alpha male apex predator. And then our pug, I got him on the great indoors, which was a 

111
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.360
short-lived

112
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.360
 show. There was a scene that required this guest star to be holding a baby pug, the person in charge. Let me talk that dog. And that dog is here now. And he's the sweetest boy. And in the show, the dog's name was Jonathan and the dog, the puppy's name was cowboy. So I brought 

113
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.360
him

114
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.360
 home. And at that point, my kids were like 11 and eight. And I was like, well, the dog's name is 

115
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.360
a cowboy. And um,  the name of the dog on TV was Jonathan. And, but

116
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.193
 I was like, you can name the dog, whatever you want.

117
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.570
And they looked at me like I was crazy. They were like,

118
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.380
the dog's name was cowboy Jonathan and I went, okay.

119
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.910
It is Joel McHale, knife collection, correction,

120
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.990
knife, come up. Sword and weapon collection. Yeah.

121
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:45.880
I don't know what's wrong with me. It's just,

122
00:07:45.881 --> 00:07:50.770
I've always collected knives and like nunchucks and Billy

123
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:54.790
clubs and throwing knives. I don't know why.

124
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:57.520
And it's we people like, it's weird. I'm like, yeah,

125
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.630
I just was always obsessed with them. And I ha like, I,

126
00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:05.320
it's hard for me not to go into a knife store. If I'm walking by one,

127
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.770
I blow like on Instagram, I follow a bunch of knife companies, you know,

128
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.220
to keep up. And my wife was like, can you just put all those away?

129
00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:15.310
And I was like, yeah. And then I never do last one on this page.

130
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.500
Zodiac sign Scorpios,

131
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.740
which means we have tails that are poisonous

132
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.800
is Joel McHale is Joel

133
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:31.600
McHale. Oh, here we go. Nice. Yeah.

134
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.140
Uh, what are you looking at? Is Joel McHale related?

135
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.340
Ryan Seacrest. His pile of money goes all the way to the clouds.

136
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.450
So he's very nice successful, man. We are not related.

137
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:50.500
We worked at EA forever or as I like to call it the network.

138
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.670
So I would see him in the hallways and I would just, uh, uh, he would just,

139
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.320
he was so busy counting his money that, so I didn't, you know,

140
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.860
I don't want to interrupt that. Um, very nice guy. And now he has a beard.

141
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.550
Copied me is Joel McHale.

142
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.500
Left-handed Oh, wow. Would you ask? It's weird.

143
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.390
I'm left-handed for writing and like brushing my teeth and fine

144
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:20.930
motor skills. And I am right-handed for gross motor skills.

145
00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:24.140
So throwing balls and golfing and batting,

146
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.430
I could become a professional athlete if all my talent was in one arm,

147
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.670
but the last it's not,

148
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.750
we all have crosses to bear and I would bear mine on my right shoulder.

149
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.250
Is Joel McHale, a lawyer? Um, no,

150
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.020
not even close.

151
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.490
I'm super dyslexic and cheated my way through high school and college and

152
00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:50.150
everything. I played one and it made it, I said words out loud.

153
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:52.640
That sounded like I was one kind of, but, um, no,

154
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:57.320
I would be a terrible lawyer where Joel McHale. Okay.

155
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.030
Where is Joel McHale from? Yeah, it was my hometown. So,

156
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.600
uh, that's. That's where I'm from. And as everybody know, uh,

157
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:08.240
I started a little coffee company called Starbucks,

158
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:10.610
a little computer company called Microsoft and some,

159
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.940
I helped start an online shopping thing called Amazon.

160
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.800
I can't remember the name of it. Anyway.

161
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.380
Did Joel McHale go to college? Oh, thank you.

162
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.490
I went to the university of Washington go Huskies.

163
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.890
Has Joel McHale been? What have I been,

164
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.790
where have you been? I feel like I'm constantly doing interviews like this,

165
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:37.430
so you don't have to ask that question. Where have you been,

166
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.710
I've been trying to get your attention this whole time.

167
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.360
Where have I been on card sharks on ABC Sunday nights at 10 o'clock,

168
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.230
nine central last ones. Pressure. Here we go.

169
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.990
Where did Joel McHale meet his wife? Uh,

170
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.880
that's a good question. Well, I met her twice. First time.

171
00:10:55.881 --> 00:11:00.260
I was a freshman and she was a senior, Ooh, older woman.

172
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:04.490
She's only one year older because I entered college as an older person.

173
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:08.750
And she was very young for college and I met her and I, and I was like,

174
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.460
that's a very pretty woman.

175
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.350
And then I did not see her again for like three years. And then, um,

176
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.420
I was shooting a movie,

177
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.360
a crazy movie in Seattle and her mom was an extra and her brother

178
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:27.620
was a production assistant and he reintroduced us and she was like, yeah,

179
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:29.060
I know who he is. I don't need to see him again.

180
00:11:29.061 --> 00:11:31.070
And that's when she fell in love with me. No,

181
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.380
I called my friend Kim and I was like, Hey,

182
00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:36.380
do you think you could put a good word in for me with Sarah Williams?

183
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.210
And she was like, ah, good luck.

184
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.560
But Sarah took pity on me and allowed me to take her out.

185
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.030
And uh, and then I,

186
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.870
I wore her down and she then eventually agreed to marry me.

187
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.940
Thank God that was almost 24 years ago. And she's regretted it ever.

188
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.710
Well, that was very fun. Um, thanks for having me.

189
00:11:56.711 --> 00:12:00.010
And this is the part of the show where people would say, thank you, wired,

190
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.740
and then they'd throw the board, but I'm not going to do that.

191
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.930
I'm going to throw those little things. I'll see you later.

192
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.870
I'm off camera, right?
