00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>This is an example of a suspension bridge,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.090
and this is a capable state of bridge and an arch bridge,

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.400
a beam bred sprint delever, brandable bridge.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.650
There are a lot of different kinds of bridges,

5
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.360
but they all serve the same thing.

6
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.330
<v 1>So a bridge is a structure that's designed to be able to carry movable</v>

7
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:20.300
loads from one side to another.

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.100
It needs to be able to traverse or span a distance,

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.590
whether it's caused by a body of water or another road that's beneath.

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.450
<v 0>This is the guy who decides what kind of bridges to make.</v>

11
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.490
<v 1>My name is Dr. Nehemiah Maybree. I am a structural engineer and educator.</v>

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.440
<v 0>And what is a structural engineer?</v>

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.420
<v 1>Structural engineer is an engineer that specializes in designing</v>

14
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:48.020
structures or any types of stable bodies.

15
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.320
That's able to resist loaves or weights of any kind.

16
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.710
<v 0>So why are there so many different types of bridges.</v>

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.730
<v 1>Bridges are designed from the top down,</v>

18
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.610
but they're built from the ground up. And so we,

19
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:08.690
as engineers began to think how much load or what type of weight this is

20
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.130
Brittany to carry, and how would this deck then transfer that weight,

21
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.930
whether it's a moving truck or a resting care pit or concrete

22
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:18.560
divider.

23
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.900
<v 0>How do you decide what kind of bridge to build?</v>

24
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.110
<v 1>Right. So there's a couple of things we look at when we want to design a bridge.</v>

25
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.210
So you look at skew angle,

26
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.390
you're going to look at stationy or work points.

27
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.330
You also going to look at what we call a typical section,

28
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.560
which is what is it gonna look like if once we slice this bridge in half,

29
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.830
what do we want that typical section to look like? And then from there,

30
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.700
once we get that,

31
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.560
it's a matter of calculating the loads that the various lists of girders or

32
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.540
various length of materials that are necessary.

33
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.530
We're going to also look at the material that we want to use to then be able to

34
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.990
produce that typical section that we desire.

35
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.030
There are primarily two main forces that each component each member of a bridge

36
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:03.920
is going to experience is either a tension force or a compression force.

37
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.690
Attention for us is basically a force that will attempt to try and stretch

38
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.870
the member or stretch the component of the bridge.

39
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.790
And a compression for us is a force that will attempt to shrink the member

40
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.440
or the component of the bridge.

41
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.270
And so those are the two main forces that any member of the bridge will have to

42
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:26.870
experience. Some members will have to experience both at the same time.

43
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.600
For instance, if you have a beam now,

44
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:33.980
a beam is a long member that is meant to span from one support to the other

45
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.780
support. In many typical cases,

46
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.670
the beams are supporting the loads transfer from the deck. Well,

47
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:41.900
in the middle of the span,

48
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:46.400
these beings are often bending or experiencing a

49
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:50.810
stresses or a force that causes a bend. Well, in this case,

50
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.490
you're going to have the bottom of the beam.

51
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.960
That's going to be tempted to be stretched. That is attention for us. However,

52
00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:00.700
the top of the beam as it bends is to be experienced in a compression force

53
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.990
because at the top,

54
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.860
it's going to be shrinking an example of a component experiencing maybe just

55
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.440
compression would be the columns.

56
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.870
This is a member of a part of the substructure,

57
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.440
which is connected directly to the foundation as the loads from the beam.

58
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.970
Rest on the columns,

59
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.960
the columns are going to be experiencing compression more specifically,

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.570
axial compression along the lift of the column.

61
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.030
Another case where attention may be the only thing,

62
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.880
given a case of a suspicion bridge.

63
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.080
These are bridges where you see a draping cord or cable going from one support

64
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:32.650
to the other,

65
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.730
and then hanging from those raping cables are additional cables that are then

66
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.160
attached to the deck to hold up the deck. Well,

67
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.730
these particular cables are experiencing pure attention because it is

68
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.610
experiencing a forest that is stretching those cables.

69
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.540
<v 0>So here's a bunch of different bridge types.</v>

70
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.860
<v 1>The suspension bridges,</v>

71
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.600
they are typically supports or towers connected by a draping

72
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.560
cable. And from those draping cables on both sides of the bridge,

73
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.640
there are vertical cables that then connect to that draping cable down to the

74
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:06.480
deck. And the way that the deck is then resisted by those vertical cables.

75
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:10.650
And Tenten connected to the draping cables that then transfer the load to these

76
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.550
towers.

77
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.100
<v 0>What's the best example of a suspension bridge.</v>

78
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.350
<v 1>The most recognizable example,</v>

79
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.680
particularly in the United States is the golden gate bridge.

80
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.470
The golden gate bridge is that bright red,

81
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.510
beautiful landmark out West that has these two very strong draping

82
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:31.860
cables going from the North to the South tower. And from those cables,

83
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.060
they're typically made of steel wires wound and compacted together,

84
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.260
which make them very, very,

85
00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:41.340
very strong intendant draping vertically from those main cables down to the

86
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:42.120
deck.

87
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.780
What's so great about this suspicion bridge is that it's in a region that is

88
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:50.010
known to experience earthquake being that they are supported by cables.

89
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.150
For the most part, there is the ability for bridges like this,

90
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.950
to be able to have some sort of gift and not be so stiff and be able to

91
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:02.910
move even at the ground shakes without severely damaged in itself.

92
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.970
The North and South ends of a suspension bridge,

93
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.440
particularly the golden gate bridge are referred to as peers.

94
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:13.170
And these peers act as the substructure,

95
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.030
which needs to resist those forces that is being applied to it by these

96
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:18.864
main cables.

97
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.950
And so these big peers need to be extremely reliable because they are

98
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.070
essentially resisting half of the bridges weight.

99
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.373
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

100
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.870
<v 0>What's another type of bridge.</v>

101
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.700
<v 1>The similar or cousin I like to think of to the suspension bridge is a cable</v>

102
00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.350
Staybridge. And this case,

103
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.250
this is similar in that they are towers primary supports that then connect to

104
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:50.820
the ground. But instead of having two main draping cables,

105
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.060
the cables are then attached directly from those towers,

106
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:55.890
from those peers to the deck,

107
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.290
each side of the sort of acts as a counterweight to the other side.

108
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.040
And so this is not only helpful in the way that the bridge remains in

109
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:04.880
equilibrium,

110
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.810
but this is also something that many have used to their advantage throughout

111
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.640
construction of those bridges as well,

112
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.610
by coating things in place as things are being built.

113
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.650
What it allows you to do is use cables to then act as a resisting

114
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:23.600
force to the suspended or a hanging deck because the deck in

115
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.480
and of itself is not required to have anything beneath it.

116
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.340
Your cables are able to go much,

117
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:32.300
much longer than you could fabricate anything else to serve as a soup.

118
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.820
<v 0>So cable stayed would be really useful for longer toll bridges.</v>

119
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.810
<v 1>Yes. So the Milan buy it up is actually the tallest bridge in the world.</v>

120
00:06:40.811 --> 00:06:45.640
Being that you have each peers that is about the height of the AFA tower itself.

121
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.820
And from it, you have your cables that are keeping the deck in place,

122
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.850
making it a very aesthetically appealing bridge,

123
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.770
but also using the counterweights of both sides to be able to have a much

124
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.420
longer span in between peers than you would with any other bridge type there's

125
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.600
only, what's so long, you can design a plank or a girder. And so,

126
00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:09.430
because you don't want to have so many supports also when you're versing or

127
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:12.160
you're building a bridge across a large body of water,

128
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.680
the energy and the effort it takes to,

129
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.420
to drill piers or piles down below beneath the surface

130
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.710
of the water and to build these supports makes it more of an incentive to have

131
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:25.210
less support, right?

132
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.710
Because we want less supports we're then going to consider a bridge type that

133
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:32.800
can allow us to have longer spans,

134
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.350
hence the suspension bridges and even more.

135
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:38.980
So the cable state bridges becomes an attractive option.

136
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.990
Not to mention it just looks cool.

137
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.040
<v 0>So that means some cable stayed. Bridges might have only one support. Right?</v>

138
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.970
<v 1>Exactly. So the Langkawi SkyBridge is a curved pedestrian bridge.</v>

139
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.030
It's just beautiful. It has the aesthetic value right there.

140
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.500
It's an interesting design challenge.

141
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.090
When you look at how can we put this manmade structure in this place,

142
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.230
but yet at the same time preserve the natural beauty of that environment.

143
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.630
So it is then advantageous to then say,

144
00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:07.630
how can we have the minimal model appears in this case,

145
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:12.730
even one pier positioned and act as a support for the entire bridge,

146
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.470
which is why this trust pier is singularly located and then attach the

147
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:21.880
cables eight cables to be exact that are necessary to support the deck and

148
00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:26.380
various points thus providing the support needed to support the traffic.

149
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.350
<v 0>Can you combine these different bridge types? Yes.</v>

150
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.180
<v 1>So the Brooklyn bridge is a good example about hybrid between a suspension</v>

151
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:37.660
bridge, as well as a cable stayed bridge. So you have your very,

152
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:39.850
very large towers, your pillars,

153
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.670
your peers that have existed for a very,

154
00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:47.020
very long time that had these drapes cables from one to the other,

155
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.230
from these drink cables, they're vertical cables that are attached to the deck,

156
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.650
as you would see in any other suspension bridge. But if you look very,

157
00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:56.850
very closely, you will also see some cables. Aren't at a diagonal.

158
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.390
They're also attached from the deck directly to these tower peers,

159
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.510
which makes it more of a hybrid between your suspension bridge,

160
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.770
as well as you're able state state,

161
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.930
the cables of the Brooklyn bridge are comprised of 19 strands that are

162
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:11.070
then bundled together.

163
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:16.020
And then each of these are composed of about 278 wires per strand.

164
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.580
And together, they actually produce a much stronger tension resistance.

165
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.880
Then if you just had a single solid strands,

166
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:28.500
those towers on the Brooklyn bridge are stone towers as well using limestone,

167
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:32.970
granite and other rocks that have proven to be able to stand the test of time

168
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.240
because of their durability and strength and compression.

169
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.740
<v 2>[Inaudible] what is our third bridge type.</v>

170
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.720
<v 1>Arch bridges are primarily resisting the load and axial compression along the</v>

171
00:09:50.721 --> 00:09:52.850
art within art bridges themselves.

172
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.080
You could have a spandrel art bridge where the deck is a buff, the arch,

173
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.400
or there are cases where the arch is elevated and the deck is actually through

174
00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:04.340
the arts. And so we call that a through arch bridge,

175
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.540
particularly stone bridges stand the test of time because stones are a natural

176
00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:09.290
material.

177
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.700
And so using a material that has already went through the years of weathering

178
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.010
countless years of re formation,

179
00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:20.090
and really been able to remain what it is over millennia.

180
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.170
So I think that's one of the reasons why stone bridges and even art stone

181
00:10:24.171 --> 00:10:27.380
bridges is able to stand the test of time because it's simply asking of the

182
00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:30.920
material, what the material has already been doing for many, many,

183
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:35.690
many years when it's designed appropriately. And the geometry is nailed.

184
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.880
You can pretty much have a bridge that is.

185
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.180
<v 2>Invisible. What's a good example of an ancient arch.</v>

186
00:10:41.181 --> 00:10:42.500
That's still standing today.

187
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.090
<v 1>Conduct another example of a stone arch bridge. Here.</v>

188
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:51.170
We have series of stone arcs that allow the force to be transferred actually

189
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.150
throughout the art, these smaller arches.

190
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.730
Then of course transfer the load to the bigger arches.

191
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.860
It takes advantage of the opportunity to break breaking up.

192
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:02.720
The spans says that so much isn't required of a single art.

193
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.200
It's also redistributing the load of law across the smart arches,

194
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.200
so that as they're transferred upon the bigger arches,

195
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.510
the larger artists can then act as peers that are space further out apart

196
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.373
giving greater space.

197
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.490
<v 2>[Inaudible] what then is a trust bridge.</v>

198
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.770
<v 1>Trust is a structural type that is comprised of several different</v>

199
00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:31.940
elements. The triangle,

200
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:36.980
the shapes are necessary such that each element of the trust is experiencing

201
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.500
a pure attention or peer compression.

202
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.810
<v 2>Can you give us an example? So the city.</v>

203
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.650
<v 1>Of Harbor bridge employees to trust in the staple of an art,</v>

204
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.540
and it also is the type of art that we refer to as a through art grid.

205
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.100
So is that the deck is not above the art, but it's in line or belief.

206
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.090
The apex of the art,

207
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.950
there are also vertical stress that then connect from the trust art that

208
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:01.930
are to support the deck tension.

209
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.160
This aligns with the use of the elements within the trust as well,

210
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.930
which are also designed and put in place to be able to only experience purely

211
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.080
axial forces, whether it be in compression or intention.

212
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.820
<v 0>Aren't trust bridges used by the military for rapid deployment.</v>

213
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:18.690
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

214
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.830
The Bailey Ridge is sort of a military bridge that is prefabricated prebuilt

215
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.640
away from the site that it is to be put in place to transfer vehicle or

216
00:12:26.641 --> 00:12:27.660
pedestrian traffic.

217
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.670
It really came out of the need for military units to be able to quickly build a

218
00:12:32.671 --> 00:12:33.451
bridge for it,

219
00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:36.780
to be light enough for them to carry with them as they move from one place to

220
00:12:36.781 --> 00:12:39.060
the other. And it's sort of like an erector set,

221
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.430
a piece-by-piece prefabricate it put together and can be constructed

222
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.930
without the use of heavy machinery without the use of a crane or any pile

223
00:12:48.931 --> 00:12:50.130
drivers of any sort.

224
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.670
<v 2>[Inaudible] what type of bridges this.</v>

225
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.870
<v 1>So I can deliver is a structure that is support it on one end,</v>

226
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.880
where there is a fixed site or support whether beams or other

227
00:13:08.881 --> 00:13:13.230
types of support members that are resisting the rotation of the deck.

228
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:13.980
And so can,

229
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.550
the LIBOR is incredibly important to make sure that the fixed in is strong

230
00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:22.320
enough and that the flexing extended member has the ability to

231
00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:25.650
resist the tension on the top and the compression on the bottom,

232
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.910
perhaps the longest Kendall LIBOR bridge has the Pontiac Quebec bridge there in

233
00:13:29.911 --> 00:13:31.740
Quebec, Canada steel,

234
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.010
unlike concrete is extremely strong intention.

235
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.250
It can resist forces that attempt to stretch it.

236
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.110
And so while we are making beams that perhaps are going to experience

237
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.760
a lot of bending,

238
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.890
we want something that can resist the compression at the top and the tension

239
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.130
at the bottom, or vice versa, depending on how it's expected.

240
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.790
<v 0>So how do you make a material that resists heavy loads?</v>

241
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.830
<v 1>We've gotten very sophisticated in how we are anticipating the types of lows</v>

242
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.510
that these beams are going to experience.

243
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.650
And so instead of just simply putting steel inside of the concrete.

244
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.320
So as you had that reinforced composition,

245
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.110
there's another type that we call pre-stressed concrete.

246
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:16.860
We take the steel before we bring the concrete in and we stretched out the

247
00:14:16.861 --> 00:14:19.410
steel. And while they're in that tension position,

248
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.970
we then pour the concrete around it and create a beam with the tension steel.

249
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.040
And after that concrete has hardened,

250
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.160
then we released the tension off of that steel,

251
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:34.200
such that now the steel wants to then retract back to its original position,

252
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.480
but because it now has concrete around it,

253
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.550
it is actually pre stressing before it experienced any load is already applying

254
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.920
a stress load on the concrete.

255
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.850
And so now you have a bowl where the concrete or the beam is going want to

256
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:51.000
naturally without any load on it, bow up a little bit.

257
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.190
And so that's a way to sort of anticipate the fact that when Lowe's go and we

258
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:56.330
put these beams in place,

259
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.020
the Lowe's are going to want to make the beam deflect downward.

260
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.480
But because we put what we call Canberra,

261
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.690
we put Canberra into this pre-stressed beam.

262
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.700
We sometimes are able to achieve no deflection at all at the beginning of

263
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.593
installation.

264
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.590
<v 2>What other bridge types are there?</v>

265
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.180
<v 1>Well, we're talking about plank bridges, then those planks are acting as beams.</v>

266
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.330
And so they have to resist what we call bending moment.

267
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.860
And so a bending moment is what causes these beams in this case to experience

268
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.400
both tension and compression compression, being at the top,

269
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.030
as it begins to bend intention, being at the bottom as it begins to deflect.

270
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.440
So you being bridge is the largest wooden footbridge in the world.

271
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.090
It has wares of a thousand wooden pillars that have been driven

272
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.120
throughout the water, along the length of the bridge.

273
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.260
It has approached bands that were originally made of stone or brick,

274
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.350
but had then also been replaced by wood over time.

275
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.180
The weathering and the deterioration of certain pillars have been

276
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:06.640
replaced with concrete. But nevertheless,

277
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:11.500
this is primarily an entirely constructed Woodbridge that offers

278
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.070
amazing views, their Miramar along the length of this bridge.

279
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.220
There are four wooden pavilions at equal distance.

280
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.700
I don't know you would call them maybe a check points along the length of the

281
00:16:21.701 --> 00:16:23.290
bridge being that is so long.

282
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.533
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

283
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.700
So what about this bridge in a notion that Japan.

284
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.140
<v 1>What type is this, this Ridge, there's another pure example of a bridge type.</v>

285
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.730
You aren't separate members that you're connecting and transferring low with,

286
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.690
but it can almost be looked at as a frame in and of itself that put in place.

287
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.340
And you look at it and this, the money side right there,

288
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.890
like looking at the super steep incline and decline that it has when you're

289
00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.210
approaching the bridge.

290
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:03.190
That site definitely it helps exaggerate the steepness of the gray. However,

291
00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:07.780
it is a lot steeper than your typical Brit on it's a

292
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:12.100
vertical carb as we call it. It has about 5%, 6% slope,

293
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:17.020
which is quite the slope for any passenger or vehicle driver may

294
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:21.670
typically drive on, but is necessary because instead of being a moveable bridge,

295
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.910
they decided to make it high enough with enough vertical clearance,

296
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.200
such that to ships can then pass their Japan right underneath it,

297
00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:33.860
without any needs of actuators or mechanical devices, to be able to, to move.

298
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.170
<v 2>[Inaudible]. And then there are movable bridges.</v>

299
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:49.030
<v 1>Move where bridges are things that we see that are designed to be able to not</v>

300
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:49.950
transfer it.

301
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:54.360
The low sturdy continuously using a deck that connects across the chasm.

302
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:59.220
But it's also designed by some mechanical powered devices to be able to

303
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:03.720
move into lift up such that the waterway that is traversing can allow the

304
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:07.350
passions of bolts or any other vessels that need to pass by.

305
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.550
It can then also be lower back in place so that the lows can continue to travel

306
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:11.940
across.

307
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.920
<v 0>It. Let's hear an example. So the.</v>

308
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.110
<v 1>Somerset bridge is a very,</v>

309
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:21.000
very short timber bridge to be able to cover a passageway

310
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:23.880
in Bermuda that connects Somerset to work Bermuda.

311
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.860
And it's a movable bridge as well.

312
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.030
This bridge doesn't need to be completely moved out of the way there aren't big

313
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.090
ship or water vessels that are passing through. In fact,

314
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.230
this mover bridge is operated by hand, unlike other movable bridges,

315
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.210
which may use hydraulics or other mechanical means it's just hand-crank

316
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:47.190
bridges that allows the deck to open up just perhaps two or three

317
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:52.110
feet, just wide enough for a mask of a small boat to be able to pass through.

318
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.070
<v 0>What about a bigger example? Okay. Yeah.</v>

319
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.590
<v 1>Ah, okay. I got you. Gates hit millennium bridge.</v>

320
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.320
This bridge is actually a pedestrian bridge,

321
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:04.820
not meant to transfer any vehicle traffic, but Walker's,

322
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.250
doggers cyclists are able to travel that curve outer semicircle of the bridge.

323
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.110
It's amazing because it has sort of that I look is referred to as the winking

324
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.340
eye, as a nickname, just incredible and incredible does Marvel,

325
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.900
particularly when it first went up,

326
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.900
it was one of the first of its kinds that we are ever seen like that instead of

327
00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:27.140
actually moving and separating two components of the bridge,

328
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.950
it is saved in a way such that the semi-circles are able to rotate.

329
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.930
And when it is in an upright position,

330
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.700
it then creates enough vertical clearance for ships and sea vessels to then pass

331
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.850
underneath. And then it's simply rotate it back into it place.

332
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.520
<v 0>What about this Saifai looking bridge.</v>

333
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.600
<v 1>It's pretty cool. Looks like a little roly-poly bridge.</v>

334
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.370
And what's interesting about this bridge is that as in a lot of movable bridges,

335
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.420
this has several joints throughout and triangular sections such that it's able

336
00:19:56.421 --> 00:20:00.830
to curl up upon itself with multiple bending locations throughout the length of

337
00:20:00.831 --> 00:20:04.220
the bridge. So as it curls up using the power of hydraulics,

338
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.020
being a system that employs the pressure of fluids is able to then

339
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.100
add it size, be deployed very quickly, rolled up,

340
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.750
put back down again,

341
00:20:14.751 --> 00:20:19.340
nice and neatly triangular segments fold on top of each other and then roll back

342
00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:21.080
out just as easy as you would see a.

343
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.100
<v 0>Is there one bridge that puts a bunch of these examples together,</v>

344
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.970
the tower bridge.

345
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.690
<v 1>This is another kind of hybrid bridge. It's a suspension bridge.</v>

346
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.480
And then it's also a movable bridge in the middle,

347
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.000
on the outsides of the towers.

348
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.270
There are suspension cables vertically supporting the deck,

349
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.410
but then there is a walkway bridge at the top of the two towers beneath there is

350
00:20:42.411 --> 00:20:45.710
a Drawbridge that lifts up allowing the passage of ships.

351
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.910
But what's interesting about the tower bridge is that there is also a walkway

352
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:49.990
bridge at the top,

353
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.460
which in and of itself acts as a connecting member between the two towers,

354
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.790
because the outsides of the towers are suspension bridges.

355
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.670
They are experiencing sort of a cooly force.

356
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.180
That's attempting to pull them apart. Therefore,

357
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:08.350
the walkway that is connected at the top, the acting as a connecting member,

358
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.210
that's experiencing tension itself,

359
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.360
keeping the top of the towers also aligned in place.

360
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.700
<v 2>[Inaudible] what is the same about all these different bridges?</v>

361
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.030
<v 1>All of these different types of bridges are essentially doing the same thing</v>

362
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.330
they're carrying low and they're transferring it to the ground.

363
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.040
They're just accomplishing that and slightly.

364
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:32.963
<v 2>Different ways.</v>

365
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.650
So how do you make sure a bridge stays up for a very long time.

366
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.770
<v 1>Infrastructure that has been built years ago,</v>

367
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:45.180
expiring for lack of a better word around the same time causes

368
00:21:45.181 --> 00:21:49.980
decision-makers at the determine what will we replace entirely and what can we

369
00:21:49.981 --> 00:21:51.540
afford to just simply repair.

370
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.700
It's not uncommon for bridges to be designed with what we call a 50 year design

371
00:21:56.701 --> 00:22:01.350
life cycle bridges incorporate a lot of reliability

372
00:22:01.351 --> 00:22:06.150
measures, which determine with a high reliability,

373
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.350
this bridge will be safe for this amount of time, say 50 years.

374
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.550
That doesn't mean that this bridge can no longer perform its function after that

375
00:22:14.551 --> 00:22:18.330
design life. However, this is just the highest, uh,

376
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.390
interval confidence for which that structure can be designed.

377
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.100
You may see in our country, particularly may countries that had large,

378
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.200
massive infrastructure projects,

379
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:33.420
50 or so years ago now at a point where a lot of our heavily

380
00:22:33.421 --> 00:22:37.050
used bridges and structures are requiring frequent maintenance.

381
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.420
There needs to be a more frequent inspection cycle.

382
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.220
There needs to be perhaps some modifications removal of the concrete that has

383
00:22:44.221 --> 00:22:48.780
spalled off or deteriorated or crumble and replaced with something more durable,

384
00:22:48.781 --> 00:22:53.550
such as weather protected steel, which we have or epoxy coated deck.

385
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.590
And so there are rehabilitation efforts that can just as well reduce or

386
00:22:58.591 --> 00:23:03.030
restore the ability of the bridge, as opposed to just tearing it down.

387
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.600
Perhaps there may be cases where an engineer may go in and spec,

388
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.980
they analyze that,

389
00:23:07.981 --> 00:23:12.540
look at how it may have deteriorated or fatigued over its life cycle.

390
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.390
And they won't recommend that it'd be torn down,

391
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.290
but they may recommend that it'd be posted and that instead of carrying a

392
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:20.910
certain amount of load, now,

393
00:23:20.911 --> 00:23:25.200
it be determined that it can only carry a fraction of that load and continue to

394
00:23:25.201 --> 00:23:26.820
then function safely for the public.

395
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:31.290
Restoring urban infrastructure is a huge issue because of the fact that the

396
00:23:31.291 --> 00:23:33.480
users increase at such a higher rate.

397
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.870
And that's why in York allowing the bridges age of the bridges,

398
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.010
and as well as the levels of use that they experience require more frequent

399
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.490
intervals of repair maintenance inspection for the public.

400
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.550
We have a high number on a set,

401
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.530
the will number of either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete

402
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.540
bridges, which is why there has been widespread support for the restoration and

403
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:58.580
improvement of our nation's infrastructure.

404
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.020
So the choice is either preservation and repair or completely.

405
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.600
<v 3>New construction.</v>
