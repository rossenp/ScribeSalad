00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.930
<v 0>Money can actually buy happiness, but only about 10% of it.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.730
If you tell me how much money you make,

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.960
I can tell you how happy you are going to be in your life, but only by 10%,

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.550
because the other 90% of happiness is related to how you process the world

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:19.110
around you and your genetic makeup, which means that 90% is up to you.

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.570
<v 0>Hi, I'm Amy Blankson. I'm the founder and CEO of fearless positivity.</v>

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.800
I researched the intersection of happiness technology and wellbeing.

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.690
And today I'm here to debunk some myths that we've all heard and believe about

10
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:42.020
happiness. You either have happiness or you don't.

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.910
It turns out that some people are actually born happier than other people.

12
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:51.470
Some people are born predisposed to be more satisfied than other

13
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:55.910
people. And some people have a harder time finding that level of satisfaction.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.840
Researchers found that only 10% of your happiness is due to your environment.

15
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.670
The other 90% is due to your deans and your perception of the world.

16
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.030
The key here is that it doesn't have to be the end of the story,

17
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.320
despite your genes.

18
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.700
We all have the capacity to increase our happiness levels and to practice

19
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:17.420
happiness. Overall, happiness looks the same around the world.

20
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.470
Happiness takes on a different sense of meaning and context of the cultures

21
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:22.280
around the world.

22
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.880
If you're a scientist and you're trying to study and measure happiness,

23
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.180
we actually look at something called subjective wellbeing,

24
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.260
which is the metric being used to measure happiness on a global scale,

25
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.270
through the UN global happiness report,

26
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.390
the UN global happiness report comes out every year,

27
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:41.000
reporting on the happiest countries in the world.

28
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.830
And every year consistently the Scandinavian countries top the list.

29
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.760
The question is,

30
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.930
why do these countries consistently show up as happier than others?

31
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.700
What makes them happier countries?

32
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.520
If you're familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of needs, you know,

33
00:01:55.521 --> 00:02:00.470
that shelter and food are the bedrock of being able to reach a level of

34
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.150
self actualization on your life.

35
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.440
So having those taken care of and provided by those countries enables

36
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:10.580
individuals to pursue other passions that help them to move up the triangle for

37
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:14.660
happiness, but other countries that maybe are not as wealthy.

38
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.610
Also top the list what's interesting is that a number of countries who have

39
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:24.410
high levels of social support have been indicated to be some of the happier

40
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:25.010
countries.

41
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.640
So if we're looking for a culture that is going to embrace and to create a

42
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:30.200
global level of happiness,

43
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.460
the fastest way to get there is by providing social support to those around you.

44
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.850
<v 1>There's power in positive thinking, happiness.</v>

45
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.400
<v 0>It's actually something that you can get better at.</v>

46
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.150
We've learned from scientists over the past two decades from the field of

47
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:45.590
positive psychology,

48
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.480
that our mind has incredible power to change our scenarios and our life

49
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:54.950
situations. And we can begin to train our brains to think this way,

50
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.970
by doing a series of exercises that I call the J game.

51
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.610
It's a cheesy pneumonic that I used to remember journaling gratitude,

52
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.840
acts of kindness, meditation, and exercise the Jay game.

53
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.010
When I talk about journaling,

54
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.880
we're talking about taking two minutes to write down the most meaningful moment

55
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:15.610
in the last 24 hours of your life. What were you doing?

56
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.500
Who were you with and why was it so meaningful in doing so your brain begins to

57
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:25.300
relive the most meaningful moment of the last 24 hours helping you to actually

58
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.110
re-experience that because your brain can't tell the difference between

59
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.710
visualization and actual experience. And as a result,

60
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.450
we find that your brain begins to relive this moment and feel a double sense of

61
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.870
happiness. The second habit is G G for gratitude.

62
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.790
What we're trying to do with gratitude is to retrain the neural pathways in your

63
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:50.740
brain to begin to develop a new reflex and how you're seeing and thinking about

64
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:54.070
the world. We can't be both positive and negative at the same time.

65
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.170
So when your brain is practicing, scanning your environment for positive things,

66
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.860
your brain can't literally look for all the negative things at the same moment,

67
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.820
you're beginning to all of a sudden find new ways to scan your environment for

68
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:08.290
the good and over time.

69
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.070
This becomes a reflexive habit that changes your outlook on life.

70
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.280
The third habit is a for acts of kindness.

71
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.810
I recommend you take two minutes a day to thank or praise somebody in your

72
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.720
social support network you can do so by text,

73
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.660
by phone in person or even in handwritten letter.

74
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.290
But what happens when you send a quick message to somebody saying,

75
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.080
thank you for something that you've done, all of a sudden,

76
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:36.160
you create a positive feedback loop that not only makes the other person feel

77
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:38.980
happier, but it also makes you feel happier.

78
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.150
And so you begin to create a virtuous cycle. And for meditation,

79
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.040
I recommend you take two minutes a day to simply watch your breath go.

80
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.110
<v 2>N S and out when you.</v>

81
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.900
<v 0>You meditate other people around you pick up the benefits of your meditation.</v>

82
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.660
Even if they don't know you're meditating.

83
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.170
This comes back to something called the mirror neuron effect.

84
00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:05.970
And the mirror neuron effect is an incredibly powerful response based on the

85
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:09.150
fact that humans are wirelessly connected to one another.

86
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.500
The last habit is exercise. Exercise is a bit of a starter drug.

87
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.030
I recommend that individuals pick one of these five habits to try for 21 days in

88
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:21.570
your life. This is up to you and you can get better at happiness.

89
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.100
If you make happiness into a work ethic, success leads to happiness.

90
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.000
Researchers have since found that the exact opposite is true.

91
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.970
Happiness leads to success. We keep thinking,

92
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.380
I'll be happy when I'll be happy. When I get good grades,

93
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.410
or I'll be happy when I get into college.

94
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.190
And then you get into college and suddenly you need to get a job,

95
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.700
and then you need to get a promotion, and then you need to buy a house.

96
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.530
And each time happiness gets pushed over the cognitive horizon and your brain

97
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:55.440
never actually gets to that feeling of happiness.

98
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.330
The reason why is because we're chasing after perhaps the wrong things.

99
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.500
When we look after success as something that leads to greater happiness,

100
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.820
we're constantly looking for external validation for our overall happiness,

101
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.380
but if we can positively identify the correct things that actually drive meaning

102
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.330
and satisfaction on a deeper level,

103
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.260
then we're actually moving towards being the person that we want to be.

104
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.050
Those are the things that create longterm satisfaction.

105
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.850
<v 1>Happiness, money can't buy happiness. Money can actually buy it.</v>

106
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.200
<v 0>Happiness, but only about 10% of it. If you tell me how much money you make,</v>

107
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.430
I can tell you how happy you are going to be in your life, but only by 10%,

108
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.020
because the other 90% of happiness is related to how you process the world

109
00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:42.880
around you and your genetic makeup, which means that 90% is up to you.

110
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:46.750
So no matter how many houses you buy, how many planes you own,

111
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.050
it won't necessarily impact your happiness. And in fact,

112
00:06:50.051 --> 00:06:52.540
it might have a decreasing effect.

113
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.630
Research finds the individuals who are more wealthy,

114
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.770
actually reach a point at which their happiness begins to decline with

115
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.790
increasing money.

116
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.380
We find that there's the law of diminishing returns and economics that says that

117
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:10.180
there is a benefit to things like money for a certain amount of time.

118
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.500
And then after a certain point,

119
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:14.890
there's a steep drop off social media makes us unhappy.

120
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.900
Many individuals feel as though social media is making us less happy overall

121
00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:22.180
by creating levels of social comparison,

122
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.220
creating an increasing cyber bullying and leading to a lot of insecurities

123
00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:31.450
about privacy. But social media is not to blame. It's about how we use it.

124
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.200
Challenges of social media is a level of social comparison,

125
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.040
always looking to other individuals in your immediate environment,

126
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:43.600
who perhaps are living a better life or their lives seemingly are

127
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:46.120
perfect. But when we look at our own lives,

128
00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:50.200
we start to wonder maybe I should be doing something different and you feel less

129
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:55.120
satisfied the fastest way to make someone less happy is to compare them to

130
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:59.590
someone else. We often say that comparison is the thief of joy.

131
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.510
So looking at social media,

132
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.310
the key is to be able to limit the amount of time and exposure

133
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.600
to social media that actually benefits you. That helps you feel connected.

134
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.530
And the moment at which you begin to find yourself comparing to somebody else to

135
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:18.370
step away. And maybe even if you need to take a digital detox,

136
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.320
thanks so much for tuning in today.

137
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.700
My goal is to leave you feeling empowered and to know that you can make a

138
00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:26.470
difference in your happiness levels,

139
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.460
that it is within reach and that you can become a best version of yourself by

140
00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:32.320
striving after your potential.

141
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.100
<v 1>Good luck.</v>
