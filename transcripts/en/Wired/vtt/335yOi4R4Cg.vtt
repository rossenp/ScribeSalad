00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.320
<v 0>Hey, I'm Mike.</v>

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.860
And today I'll be breaking down how cyberpunk is portrayed in video games.

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.200
You might've encountered cyberpunk when you've watched the matrix blade runner

4
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:19.730
or blade runner 2049.

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.440
Cyberpunk is a science fiction genre that deals a lot with corporations taking

6
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:29.120
over the world and with how technology kind of becomes invasive into our bodies.

7
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.710
The video games we'll be talking about today are cyberpunk 2077 watchdogs

8
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:38.540
Legion and Deus ex mankind divided along with other popular games like syndicate

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.470
ghost runner. They also ex human revolution and Detroit become human.

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.130
Let's take a look at how biohacking is portrayed in cyberpunk. Video games,

11
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.070
deep net cyberpunk, 2077.

12
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.740
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

13
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.150
<v 0>Cyberpunk 2077,</v>

14
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:09.980
calls it the deep net in William Gibson's Neuromancer it's called cyberspace in

15
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.810
Neal Stephenson, snow crash.

16
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.830
It's called the metaverse and the housekeepers have called it the matrix,

17
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.730
but it all basically means the same thing and net spread all over the world

18
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.330
where you can access. Basically every object, every data that is available.

19
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.350
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.220
<v 0>In cyberpunk.</v>

21
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.540
The deep net is usually geometrical objects lined up as

22
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:40.220
representations of data.

23
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.910
They're flying over this grid of electronic data points.

24
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.870
The grid is actually dominated by an early eighties movie called Tron,

25
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.170
which has these objects moving in straight lines.

26
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:54.560
It's actually one of the most iconic aspects of cyberpunk.

27
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.620
You can see this in the scene when she hacks in.

28
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.910
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.620
<v 0>The room that she's in with the other people standing there and the</v>

30
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.550
ice tub and everything. It's all represented as data.

31
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.590
And this is of course the same as in the matrix when Neo realizes

32
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:22.850
that he is the one and kind of goes into the matrix to

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.210
shape objects that are formed of code. So this is kind of the,

34
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:32.120
the visual cue that we have here from two of the kind of original cyberpunk

35
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:36.020
ancestors. So the idea of actually becoming part of the computer system,

36
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:39.710
going into the computer system is appealing in the sense that you're opening up

37
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:41.120
a completely new world, right?

38
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.880
So you're not just sitting in your basement in front of your computer,

39
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:48.140
but you're actually moving through the world of data and you can change the

40
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:48.974
world from there.

41
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.860
I'm not a hundred percent sure why they do this with the ice tub.

42
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:54.950
It's a new image. I've not seen this before, but on the other hand,

43
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:56.780
maybe they're just afraid of, you know,

44
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:00.850
her body overheating and kind of because processing power is getting jacked up.

45
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.820
So high upgrading cyberpunk, 2077.

46
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.960
<v 2>Dr. Vector, we'll see you now</v>

47
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.220
we're at a ripper doc clinic.

48
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.110
Ripper docs are specialist vendors who offer people the possibility to install

49
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:20.850
or upgrade their cyber world.

50
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.530
<v 0>Cyberpunk has a very unequal society. If you are rich,</v>

51
00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:27.870
you would probably go to a high-end clinic.

52
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.670
But since most cyber punk stories actually deal with the criminal element in

53
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:33.504
some way.

54
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.980
And V seems to be something like an hired criminal for specific jobs.

55
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.840
She probably wouldn't have the ability to go to a normal clinic or to pay for

56
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.820
high scale, uh, body augmentation. So the only choice is to go to in this case,

57
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.713
a repertoire.

58
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.790
<v 2>Ripper gave in the upper hand, pretty darn quickly need to bump up.</v>

59
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:57.624
My specs.

60
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.880
<v 0>Body modifications in cyberpunk are based on the idea of prosthesis</v>

61
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:03.810
of amputees.

62
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.310
We're kind of taking this a step further to the idea that certain jobs require

63
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:12.600
you to be implanted with something. So if you want to do a specific job,

64
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.590
your normal eyesight doesn't actually work anymore.

65
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:21.300
So you would be required to get specific eyesight or attach tools to your body

66
00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:24.600
because your body becomes kind of the tool itself.

67
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.910
<v 1>Lights out for a minute. All right,</v>

68
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.600
you might feel a little discomfort, maybe blurred vision, low contrast glitches.

69
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.260
So how's it look to you.

70
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.600
<v 2>With the scanner. We can zoom in on things and take a closer look.</v>

71
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.260
<v 1>Auto work like a charm. Now dry your weapon.</v>

72
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.320
You should see your ammo count in a brand new site.

73
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.940
<v 0>In the scene. We do see two different kinds of augmentations. On the one hand,</v>

74
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.290
we do see the ripper docks documentations, which are very mechanical.

75
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.880
It has kind of tools in his arm, which he uses for his work. On the other hand,

76
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:13.770
you see these implantations or these augmentations in dermal implant is

77
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:18.000
actually just like a, um, a glove or something that she wears now permanently.

78
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.730
So it integrates much smoother with her body.

79
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:25.290
It kind of becomes a part of an extension of her body in a much less

80
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:26.124
mechanical way.

81
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.510
<v 2>Subdermal weapon grip links to our skin and shows us weapon information like</v>

82
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:31.980
ammo count. And Fireman's.

83
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.260
<v 0>If I want to be a rough guy,</v>

84
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.420
then I would choose something very mechanical looking.

85
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:39.090
Whereas if I want to be in high society,

86
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:42.210
I would be choosing something very stylish. Think of your arm,

87
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:45.390
being displayed with Louis V tall paraphernalia,

88
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.140
and you can choose a different style to project a certain image.

89
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.560
I'm really amazed.

90
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.320
She actually gets an eye implant and an arm implant within five

91
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:01.520
minutes. She just walks out of there. If I break a leg and I wanted to reset,

92
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:05.480
and it takes like five minutes, that would be awesome. Forest augmentation,

93
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.580
docx human revolution.

94
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.650
<v 3>So how's it feel being augmented, excuse me,</v>

95
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.340
don't take it the wrong way. I mean, I've got a few neuro enhancements myself.

96
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.050
That's great ones to help me fly better,

97
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.140
but I chose to get them implanted you didn't.

98
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.700
<v 0>In the scene. Um,</v>

99
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.840
Adam Jensen is just recovered from his operations.

100
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.910
He was a human, um, security guard who got blown up at a terrorist attack.

101
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.050
His body was so damaged. That is, let's say 80%, uh,

102
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.630
augmented instead of just being a normal human.

103
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.350
This has kind of been forced on him because you couldn't consent to this.

104
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.280
You're right.

105
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.570
<v 3>I didn't choose to get augmented.</v>

106
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.340
And I still don't know if I would have if given the choice, but.

107
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.670
<v 0>Today felt good. So he actually needs these because otherwise he would die.</v>

108
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.960
So a lot of this goes actually back to the idea of disability and of norms that

109
00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:58.780
we set for what an abled body is supposed to be doing.

110
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.670
I think that's an interesting take on this, um,

111
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.350
to put the player into the position of someone who didn't want to be augmented,

112
00:07:05.351 --> 00:07:06.460
but now needs to be,

113
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.900
I think the most outstanding thing about him visually is the implantation

114
00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:13.780
office. Eyewear is actually, um,

115
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.840
covered by retractable mirror shade lenses.

116
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.640
There's a 1986 short story collection called mirror shades by Bruce Sterling.

117
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.230
And in its introduction,

118
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.040
Bruce Sterling actually says that mirror shades make you look awesome and cool

119
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.850
because they hide the crazy. You can see the crazy and the people's eyes.

120
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.650
So mirror shades is kind of like the ultimate thing for a cyberpunk biohacking,

121
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.450
docx mankind divided.

122
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

123
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:54.641
<v 0>In this scene,</v>

124
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.960
we see Rucker who is a leader for the augmented people is being forcibly removed

125
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:02.590
from power by a targeted attack, which eventually kills him.

126
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.303
<v 1>She came.</v>

127
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.630
<v 0>Rutgers seems to have some kind of body modification in his head and he does</v>

128
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:14.920
have two arm prosthesis. So it looks like he actually has human arms,

129
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.330
but when they malfunction,

130
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.060
they kind of open up and show different functionalities.

131
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.530
Body modification can be exploited since it is a commercial commodification,

132
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:27.700
right? It's an, it's something you buy from a company. If, for example, um,

133
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.160
because of an accident, you have an amputated arm.

134
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.900
Then obviously replacing that arm with a body modification actually makes a lot

135
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:39.040
of sense, but replacing healthy body organs might be risky.

136
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:43.360
And the possibility of it being hacked might actually deter you from doing that.

137
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.350
We can see this already in, for example, self-driving cars,

138
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.760
which hackers have been trying to hack and modify and remote control.

139
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:55.590
And obviously with any technology that is being run by a computer system,

140
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.090
the chance of being hacked is always possible. Consciousness, Deus,

141
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.380
ex mankind divided.

142
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.100
<v 1>The body is the prison.</v>

143
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.950
<v 0>Alison is actually referring to one of the key ideas of cyber punk</v>

144
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.430
body and mind are separate from each other. The biological,

145
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:28.610
the body is actually faulty and is limited.

146
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.870
So she wants to get rid of the body, leave behind her body, the existence,

147
00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:35.480
and kind of become pure data, pure mind,

148
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.460
pure consciousness and cyber punk is referring to ideas of transhumanism

149
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.600
to take technology and make us ever smarter, ever better.

150
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.630
The best version of the best person that we can beat. I know what you're doing.

151
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:54.140
<v 1>I've seen this kind of tech before it ended badly cure ignorance of your own</v>

152
00:09:54.141 --> 00:09:55.670
people is contemptible.

153
00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.040
This is the Ascension only our bodies will die. Our minds blue,

154
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:05.150
leave this cup of your shell and merge with the divine consciousness of the

155
00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:05.984
machine.

156
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.640
<v 0>This is a part of a religious idea of a world beyond our physical world,</v>

157
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.840
a virtual afterlife. So there is this utopian moment of this being paradise,

158
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.681
but on the other hand,

159
00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:20.360
it also is very dystopian in the sense that if it is computer

160
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.010
generated, if it is a virtual world, it also means that it can be hacked.

161
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.270
You could actually reprogram that heaven to become hell technically.

162
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.180
So there is a lot of ambiguity around this concept and, um, I, for myself,

163
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.740
don't think I would want my consciousness uploaded.

164
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.880
Let's talk about cities in cyberpunk, mega city, ghost runner.

165
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:50.060
Seeing this city is actually pretty much my expectation of visuals

166
00:10:50.061 --> 00:10:54.830
for a cyberpunk city it's night. It is almost rainy. There's fog.

167
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:59.120
The city is very vertical there's areas beneath me that I can't even see because

168
00:10:59.121 --> 00:11:02.240
of all of the fog and smoke going on there's areas above me,

169
00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:06.410
which I can only imagine where people living in. I like the darkest aesthetics,

170
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.820
neon lighting and everything being very vague and film noirish.

171
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.860
And this of course goes all back to blade runner.

172
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.690
This is exactly the kind of image that blade runner has immortalized as being

173
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.410
cyberpunk.

174
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.980
One of the aspects that everybody thinks of when they think of cyber punk is the

175
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:24.410
image of the flying cars, which open blade runner.

176
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.340
This is actually picked up here by these rails, which you can hang on to.

177
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.640
I think it's very interesting because if you think of the city as being

178
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:33.230
vertical, then of course,

179
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.640
movement on foot is going to be problematic in order to move from one place to

180
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:40.190
the other. You have to navigate by flying,

181
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:44.630
which they actually chose very well here, cityscape cyberpunk, 20,

182
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:45.464
77.

183
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.990
<v 1>It's greatly enhanced our crowd and community systems to create the most</v>

184
00:11:50.991 --> 00:11:52.970
believable city in any open.

185
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.300
<v 0>The city actually takes precedence in most of these games and it's kind of a</v>

186
00:11:58.301 --> 00:11:59.440
character of its own.

187
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.490
I liked that the game actually populates its city with a lot of different people

188
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.460
and more than most cyberpunk games,

189
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:08.560
you can actually see people from all walks of life.

190
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.340
And I also like the fact that they start off with showing you the city by day,

191
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.280
because most cyberpunk actually plays at night.

192
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.860
<v 1>The city streets are bustling with crowds of people from all facets of life,</v>

193
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.640
all living their lives within a full day and night side.

194
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.900
<v 0>I do like the fact that there is advertising everywhere.</v>

195
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.290
You kind of have to navigate this space, which is kind of overwhelming.

196
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:34.770
At first, the city is actually pretty clean, which is unusual.

197
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.110
Cyberpunk usually goes with a dirty and gritty.

198
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.380
I don't think it's actually a requirement for a city to be dirty,

199
00:12:40.381 --> 00:12:43.980
to be cyber punk. It probably goes more with the crime,

200
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:48.600
but this seems to be a part of the city that is actually very

201
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.060
central. It's kind of a business hub of some kind.

202
00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:53.760
So I think it's okay that it isn't all dirty.

203
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.420
I think it's an interesting fact that everybody seems to be very polite.

204
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.160
They actually stop at red lights,

205
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.640
which I think is very uncommon for the idea of a cyberpunk city,

206
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:07.500
which is infested with crime. I like the fact that they've taken their time and,

207
00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:12.120
and kind of constructed a real city where people actually do stop at red lights.

208
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.650
Let's see how governments are represented in cyberpunk, video games, police,

209
00:13:16.651 --> 00:13:19.110
state, they also ex mankind divided.

210
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.660
<v 1>[Inaudible] dream of it. Alex.</v>

211
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.100
<v 0>There is, um,</v>

212
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.080
a difference between worlds in cyberpunk that are still run by nations

213
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.300
and worlds, which are run by corporations,

214
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.410
but they both basically have complete military realization of security work.

215
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.860
So the idea here is not to be there to protect and serve,

216
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.940
but actually to be projecting fear, projecting control,

217
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.980
you have a lot of inequality in these worlds.

218
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:07.770
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

219
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.090
<v 0>There's a lot of conflict around the idea of police brutality of police</v>

220
00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:15.090
States. You see the police force,

221
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.740
not in day-to-day uniforms, but you see them kind of in riot gear,

222
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.160
they have heavy equipment, body armor, face plates.

223
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.430
You can also see this in the drones. They look very military.

224
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:29.910
They have actually weapons on them. So this is a surveillance state.

225
00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:34.740
This is a police state that wants to enact control by show of force. For me,

226
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.720
cyberpunk is a very political genre.

227
00:14:36.721 --> 00:14:41.640
So having political commentary in there and pointing it out is actually kind of

228
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.680
an important part of reading. This.

229
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.370
There's a correlation between what happens in cyberpunk and what happens in our

230
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:48.080
real world.

231
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.400
You could see similar things in the Hong Kong protests where the Chinese

232
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.490
government put up forces that look very military.

233
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:59.180
The Hong Kong police was decked out in riot gear and they were using facial

234
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:03.650
recognition software and the protesters were using masks to mask their

235
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.940
facial recognition.

236
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.620
So there is a correlation between cyberpunk media and activism at the moment,

237
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.440
privatization watchdogs Legion.

238
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.240
<v 4>With London under attack, by a mysterious terrorist.</v>

239
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.040
The government turns to a private military company called Albion to keep

240
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.220
everyone safe. What could possibly go wrong?

241
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.620
<v 0>What could possibly go wrong?</v>

242
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:31.510
When handing over security issues like police force to a private

243
00:15:31.511 --> 00:15:34.690
company, I would ask what could possibly go, right?

244
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.080
So if corporations take over state and national responsibilities,

245
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:43.090
then private security forces become a commodity for a specific company.

246
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.010
What would be their profit margin?

247
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.190
What would be their incentive to do certain things?

248
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.080
This is an issue that we see with the private prison system in the U S if they

249
00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:55.090
actually make money per inmate,

250
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.480
they are more incentivized to have more inmates.

251
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.610
So issues like, uh, public security, um, should not be privatized.

252
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.451
So in this clip,

253
00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:08.110
we see police forces that actually look much more like the police force were

254
00:16:08.111 --> 00:16:11.170
used to. So they are in uniform, normal clothing.

255
00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:13.810
They there's very little riot gear here,

256
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.500
or there's less of it than in the previous clip that we've seen.

257
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.940
And I think this is because the game actually wants to be closer to our reality.

258
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.080
It wants to be more like the world that we know giving you an authentic feeling

259
00:16:26.081 --> 00:16:30.070
of this is how things could go with the technologies that we already have and

260
00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:33.310
give you a more of a creepy feeling when these people become exploitative.

261
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.480
I find it interesting in this clip that they've chosen to name the company

262
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.440
Albion, I'll be honest, an old antique name for the British Isles.

263
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:45.460
It's interesting to go back to that reflection of these good old times when law

264
00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:48.670
and order was provided by Knights. So there's this poetic moment to it,

265
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.180
naming that Albion next, let's take a look at weapons.

266
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.780
Cyberware cyberpunk 20, 70.

267
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.550
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

268
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.950
<v 0>Aggressively masculine tendency in cyberpunk.</v>

269
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.330
And I think this actually goes with the idea of these visceral fight scenes.

270
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.910
They are using swords, they're using the mantis blade,

271
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.750
which of course doesn't make much sense. If you can actually have rail guns,

272
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.840
why would you even get close enough to be using blades?

273
00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:27.340
But I think it actually in a game,

274
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.930
it looks much better and it's nicer gameplay choosing to use a weapon that is

275
00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:36.820
implanted has of course the very usual advantages in the sense

276
00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:38.770
that you can hide the weapon better.

277
00:17:38.771 --> 00:17:43.090
It is actually seamlessly integrated into your arm. So when you're undercover,

278
00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:44.170
when you're doing stealth work,

279
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.550
you could actually move through recognizable scanners and so on and just look

280
00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:49.770
like you have cyber arm.

281
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.280
You can now actually shoot someone just by pointing a finger.

282
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.710
This is a power fantasy is the idea is, you know,

283
00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:59.100
you become a weapon from all of these weapons that they show you.

284
00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:03.150
I think of course the, the mantis blade is the one that looks the most awesome,

285
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.660
this unfolding of this blade and the, the ability to just, you know,

286
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:10.710
slash into bodies. It looks the most visually impressive, whereas, uh,

287
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:14.310
a Canon in your arm or something actually seems rather pedestrian in terms of,

288
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:17.160
okay, yeah, you got a gun, just this one's hidden in your arm,

289
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.710
repossessing cyberware syndicate.

290
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.620
<v 1>Upgrade potential detected.</v>

291
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.291
<v 0>In this scene.</v>

292
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:49.130
We actually see him physically removing that dark chip from the brain,

293
00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:53.690
which actually makes a lot of sense because cyber ware is a physical component

294
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.170
in your body. It's not a program being installed or something,

295
00:18:57.171 --> 00:19:01.790
but it's actually physically implanted. So you do have mechanical objects,

296
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.340
physical objects, actually in the body.

297
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.290
So in order to get an implant from the brain,

298
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:10.940
you would probably have to extract it from the brain. But, um,

299
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.840
I actually liked the idea that they're going for the PG 13 version where some

300
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:17.900
kind of thing of magick goes in and kind of pulls it out instead of just

301
00:19:17.901 --> 00:19:20.390
chopping the head up after he's got the chip,

302
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.030
he would probably either install it in himself.

303
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.470
So not depending on how the game handles that he can just implant it into some

304
00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:31.580
kind of socket or he would have to go to some kind of underground clinic and get

305
00:19:31.581 --> 00:19:36.080
it installed in the game. It usually is just a click of a button in real life.

306
00:19:36.081 --> 00:19:40.220
It would probably be very traumatic procedure to get this out and then into

307
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:43.550
yourself. And it has some very strange hygiene issues.

308
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.290
And this also has the second dimension of body modifications are an

309
00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:50.480
expensive commodity produced by companies.

310
00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:55.040
So these companies could actually offer you lending services instead of paying

311
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.780
$20,000 for it upfront, you could just pay a thousand dollars for it each month.

312
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:04.160
So what happens if you negate on that payment? At some point,

313
00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:07.700
somebody might come and repossess and recollect your organs.

314
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.140
At what point does technology become part of that human? And at what point is,

315
00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:16.640
technology is still seen as an object of technology that can be repossessed next

316
00:20:16.641 --> 00:20:18.980
up. We'll take a look at artificial intelligence,

317
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.090
Android versus human Detroit become human.

318
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.570
<v 1>I know you're angry Daniel,</v>

319
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.880
but you need to trust me and let me help. I don't want your health.

320
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.860
Nobody can help me stop.

321
00:20:33.861 --> 00:20:36.350
I just want all this to stop.

322
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.730
<v 0>So the question of consciousness and of emotions coming up in artificial</v>

323
00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:43.970
intelligence is not restricted to cyberpunk itself.

324
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.620
It's actually a theme that has been going on in science fiction, um,

325
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.340
since metropolis by Fritz Lang. But in cyberpunk, of course,

326
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.990
this is kind of also connected to the idea that machines

327
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:59.440
are essentially objects, not subjects.

328
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.270
So who gets to decide how to treat that other person,

329
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:08.110
that artificial person is actually the owner of that Android.

330
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.240
<v 1>But I was wrong. See, just like all the other humans,</v>

331
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.160
listen, I know it's not your fault.

332
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.600
These emotions are feeling are just errors in your software.

333
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.840
<v 0>The negotiator is also an Android, right?</v>

334
00:21:24.841 --> 00:21:27.180
So there's an Android talking to an Android,

335
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:31.950
trying to get him to release the human child for him to refer to emotions as

336
00:21:31.951 --> 00:21:35.400
being errors is of course, programmed into him. This goes to the,

337
00:21:35.401 --> 00:21:38.370
the idea that an emotion needs to be an error,

338
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.120
because if it was an actual emotion, you would have to grant them personhood.

339
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.110
If this Android actually could feel emotions, you are mistreating him.

340
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.660
So there's pain involved and suffering,

341
00:21:48.661 --> 00:21:50.130
and that is something you need to address.

342
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.830
<v 1>I've spent my life taking orders.</v>

343
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.250
Now it's my turn to decide.

344
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.470
<v 0>Makes a human is part of the ultimate problem of cyber punk.</v>

345
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.580
And a lot of cyber punk actually goes for the easy route that I've mentioned

346
00:22:17.581 --> 00:22:17.971
before,

347
00:22:17.971 --> 00:22:22.410
which is transhumanism and the idea that you can actually separate the body from

348
00:22:22.411 --> 00:22:24.870
the mind, even if I'm 90% metal,

349
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.450
I'm still a human because I still have a human brain.

350
00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:29.370
I'm still thinking as a human,

351
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.820
but I think that's actually oversimplification and way too much.

352
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.770
And some of the best cyber punk stories are the ones that completely throw

353
00:22:37.771 --> 00:22:40.380
you off in terms of what makes a person a person.

354
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.100
And it actually means that artificial intelligence is our persons. Um,

355
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.550
it actually means that you can become part machine.

356
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:50.580
You can meld with systems and networks.

357
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.050
All of these concepts are kind of going beyond what we consider human.

358
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.410
And I think that's where cyberpunk actually becomes really interesting.

359
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.553
<v 1>They go wrong.</v>

360
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.170
<v 0>I'm actually one of the first generations that have grown up with video games.</v>

361
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.190
I've been playing video games my whole life, and I still do it. And I love it.

362
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.130
Also. I just love talking about cyberpunk and science fiction.

363
00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:18.270
So this has been a blast.
