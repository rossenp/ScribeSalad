1
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.330
<v 1>This plane is the super canard. Look at the design on this guy.</v>

2
00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:13.340
Two sets of wings got a forward wing,

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.870
got a rear wing here by angling the forward wing at a slightly higher angle of

4
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.720
incidence than the main wing that is just tilting it up a little bit.

5
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.270
You can see the bins right there in that forward wing.

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.610
I'm tilting it up just a little bit with these upward bins.

7
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.620
Two things cause a stall to high, an angle of incidents, or too slow of a speed.

8
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:33.200
Now obviously, if the plane's flying too slow,

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.030
you just don't develop enough air flow that will have the Coanda effect to stick

10
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:38.900
to the surface of the wing.

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.280
So it's just going so slow that the airflow just kind of fails the form over the

12
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:45.500
wing. No lift plane falls out of the sky.

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.420
The other thing is that if you're angling too far upward with this wing

14
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:54.260
here, eventually it can't follow around the shape of the wing.

15
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.170
The airflow becomes disconnected. And again, we call that a stall,

16
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.830
the airflow you need airflow trailing off the back of the plane to shove the

17
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:05.420
plane up to make lift. So those are the two ways that your plane can lose lift,

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.190
uh, with a stall too slow or too high in angle of incidents.

19
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.530
So what we do with this plane is really kind of clever.

20
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.030
We angle this little wing,

21
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.550
a little bit higher angle of incidence than the main wing.

22
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:19.640
So when it gets close to stalling, a little wing will stall first,

23
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.090
drop the nose down and the main wing keeps flying.

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.220
So it's a stall resistant paper airplane.

25
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.140
One of the really cool features of this plane is that it starts with a

26
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.790
modified version of a classic paper, airplane base called a water bomb base.

27
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:38.870
I want to show you that base and then I'll walk you through the folding of the

28
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.890
super canard here, but the water bomb base idea, very powerful.

29
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.260
You can make all kinds of planes with the water bond base.

30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.530
You can make the Starfighter design starts with a water bomb base.

31
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.420
This really cool double Decker plane it's called the, uh, interlock biplane.

32
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.470
It starts with the modified water bomb base water bomb base idea.

33
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.600
The twin jet starts with a water bomb Bay, straight up water bomb base,

34
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:05.960
no modified Waterman base. That's a straight water bond base idea.

35
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:09.470
And this guy starts with a slightly modified water bomb base.

36
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.680
What the heck is a water bomb base? I've said it so many times.

37
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:16.970
You must be going crazy. Okay. So we're going to start by making diagnosable.

38
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:21.470
It's taking the top and putting it against the side first this way. And again,

39
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:25.310
I like to hold down the corner, pivot those edges together, and then sweep

40
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.350
make a nice clean fold unfold that I'm going a little bit fast.

41
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:33.800
Don't feel like you got to follow along on this necessarily.

42
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:37.700
I just want to show you the mechanics of this thing. I'm leaning at this corner.

43
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.010
Let me get that edge sweeping down sharp creases.

44
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.450
Now we've got what you would call Valley folds because they look like valleys.

45
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.810
When viewed from above let's flip our valleys over so that their mountains,

46
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.640
both of my diag or folds are now mountains.

47
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.710
I'm going to fold right across the center of that X

48
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.400
carefully up the ends of the creases.

49
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.990
<v 2>And then when I I'm to walk slowly up here, find a center, sweep that direction,</v>

50
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.300
sweep that direction, make a nice sharp crease.

51
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.260
<v 1>And then I'm going to open this up and I'm going to stand it up.</v>

52
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:17.250
So there's this fold that we just created is now a mountain fold and flip it

53
00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:17.521
around.

54
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:20.730
So the short side is on top of the X is now on the top of the page again.

55
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.070
So we were here and I'm really flipping it over and just opening it up in

56
00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:28.500
a little bit and making a little tunnel. You can see, I can,

57
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.330
I can go right into there now. Very few things happen fast in origami.

58
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:38.070
And this is one of the cool, fast happening things with just three creases.

59
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.060
We're going to make one of the all-time best basis.

60
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.300
We're creating paper airplanes, and we're going to do it just like this.

61
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.370
I'm going to take one finger and press down, right?

62
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:52.350
Where all those creases meet very gently just until the paper pops and see it,

63
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:53.520
pop change directions there.

64
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.120
And then I'm going to bring the top down and let the sides come in.

65
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.440
And that is a water bomb base. It's tightened it just a little bit,

66
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.120
fills the screen. Now look at what you've got here for making a paper airplane.

67
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.440
You've got these two corners here.

68
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.160
You can turn into tunnels in the front of the plane like I did with, uh,

69
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.310
with the twin jet. So you've got a Delta shape happening here,

70
00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:17.940
which gives you less lift upfront. There's a ton of layers.

71
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.250
You've got four good solid layers upfront.

72
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.230
And so along with having a Delta shape and multiple layers moving toward the

73
00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.340
front of the plane, you're off,

74
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.000
you're off to a great running start for developing paper airplanes.

75
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.270
This is the super canard. And to start folding,

76
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:36.750
this guy will need one sheet of eight and a half by 11 paper.

77
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.740
I prefer 20 pound paper the first time through a project like this lot of

78
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.290
serious folding. So let's get going. Let's spin it.

79
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.560
We have the long side on top and we're going to fold it in half.

80
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.050
<v 2>Carefully line up the corners. And as usual, when we're folding in half.</v>

81
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.770
<v 1>In the corners of start in the middle sweep to the outside, just like that.</v>

82
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:56.790
Nice sharp crease.

83
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.840
Now we're going to fold one third of the paper over and the way you measure

84
00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:05.430
that, we're just going to eyeball this.

85
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.890
The layered part here is going to be the same size as the unlevered part here.

86
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.600
So get it close, line it up.

87
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.550
<v 2>Make sure your layers are stand together up here.</v>

88
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.090
Don't let the layers go drifting around those corners together as you bring it

89
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:20.790
over. And.

90
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.490
<v 1>This part is going to be about the same size as that part. And.</v>

91
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.850
<v 2>It doesn't have to be perfect. Just get it as close as you can. Eyeball.</v>

92
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.530
<v 1>Make a nice sharp crease.</v>

93
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.640
I'm going to spin it around now so that the open part is toward me.

94
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.150
And we're going to do a series of what are called squash folds.

95
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.240
And the only mistake you can make with a squash fold is actually trying to do it

96
00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:46.440
too fast. So let's see what's going on with the squash fold here first.

97
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.480
So we're going to open this up,

98
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:51.660
lift this up to it's pointed right straight up at us,

99
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.440
and we're going to open the bottom two layers here,

100
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.120
put your finger the way in there. So it gets all the way to the top.

101
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.080
So this whole thing is starting to squeeze down and we're going to move the top

102
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:04.790
down, taking care of the lineup.

103
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.160
<v 2>The center crease with the center layer.</v>

104
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.460
<v 1>Here.</v>

105
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.170
So this center crease is going to line up with this center

106
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.040
layer right here,

107
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.360
and then I'm going to move the crease just to the left side of this center.

108
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.460
<v 2>Just to give me a little room, uh, to manipulate here.</v>

109
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.730
And I do that a lot, just a little,

110
00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:29.020
it's a little tiny bit of a cheat just to make sure I've got rooms to manipulate

111
00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:29.854
layers.

112
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.540
<v 1>Not really a cheat, that's just the proper way to fold. So that's a squash fold.</v>

113
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:41.440
We've taken this flap and it was sticking up like that.

114
00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:43.900
And we're squashing it reaching inside,

115
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.290
starting to move the layers to the outside and moving it down and squashing it

116
00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:48.010
flat like that.

117
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.450
Now we're going to do the same thing to the back side here.

118
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.150
And so let's flip it over and we're going to lift this layer up.

119
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.161
And again,

120
00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:04.780
we're going to open up the open layers here,

121
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.710
put your finger all the way in there. So it starts to open up.

122
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.730
Now at this point, you can't see the layers underneath, right? You're,

123
00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:16.660
you're kind of you're blocking. So once you get it going, the correct direction,

124
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.100
pro tip here, flip it over. Now you can control these two layers on it.

125
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.030
<v 2>Top, move them down so that they line up with that center crease.</v>

126
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.180
And we're going to complete the squash from the opposite side.

127
00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.100
You would normally complete a squash fold from,

128
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.870
but if you're going to make a much more accurate crease, I work up to the top,

129
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.130
sweeping down to the bottom.

130
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.790
<v 1>And now you can see you've got a water bomb like base,</v>

131
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.350
and we're not done with squash folds. Each one of these flaps, one, two, three,

132
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.500
four, it's going to get squashed folded. So let's get going on that.

133
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.830
Move that one to the move, the right hand flap to the left.

134
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.420
I'm going to press down.

135
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.320
<v 2>And carefully line up this crease with the center crease here,</v>

136
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.500
squash fold there. Okay.

137
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:02.500
So open this up a little bit more.

138
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:05.290
Sometimes it's convenient to use a pin to reach up in there.

139
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.210
If you've got a pen handy, that's a good thing to do.

140
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.840
I'm just going to reach up in there with my finger and open that up a little bit

141
00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:14.170
more, press that down. I want the squash to go neatly all the way to the top.

142
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.281
So again,

143
00:08:15.281 --> 00:08:19.360
the only mistake you can really make with a squash fold is doing it too fast

144
00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:20.710
before everything is lined up.

145
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.510
Get my crease just lined up with the center crease perfectly there. I've got it.

146
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:27.130
Squashed control.

147
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.360
<v 1>The layers. And now I'm just going to move this top flap back to the left.</v>

148
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.040
And now we're going to squash this side. So I'm lifting that up, opening it up.

149
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.970
<v 2>Carefully, positioning that crease so that the squash,</v>

150
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.040
what ends right up here at the top point.

151
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.930
And then I'm going to line up the crease that I'm flattening here,

152
00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:49.840
right with the center line carefully,

153
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:52.210
lining it up with the center line and then

154
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.800
sweeping to the outside the squash.

155
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.220
<v 1>To complete the squash. So you are squashing it down,</v>

156
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.570
but really you gotta be a little more careful than just you're going to

157
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.320
nudge it in there, coax it into coming up correctly there.

158
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:10.500
So I was squashed here. I'm taking that top layer back to the left.

159
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.550
Now I've got this sort of upside down ice cream cone or upside down kite shape

160
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:17.340
here. And now we're going to squash these guys out here.

161
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.470
So it's easier to flip it back over to squash those layers. Let's flip it over.

162
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.030
You're going to lift up one layer the right hand side and press down.

163
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:29.130
You can start to see the layer opening right here.

164
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.210
This is what we're going to squash right there, pressing down.

165
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.190
And I'm lining up the crease with this edge right here, this time,

166
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.310
this edge down here. So this long crease is lining up with just that,

167
00:09:42.311 --> 00:09:47.280
that edge right there. So again, carefully working my way up to the top point.

168
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:51.960
So that comes out and then lining up the crease and then pressing

169
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:53.280
these flat.

170
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.010
So now we're going to move this top layer back to the right,

171
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.770
and we're going to squash this one right here.

172
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:12.080
So let's lift it up and see that's where we're going to squash right in there,

173
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.943
those layers

174
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.870
and gently coaxing that top of the squash up there.

175
00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:22.850
So it meets the point carefully lining up the center crease on this flat

176
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.770
with the main center crease of the plane

177
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.310
and looking good. Now, a double check, always this,

178
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:33.320
this came out really nice and deep down here.

179
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:35.360
These corners lined up really super nice.

180
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:38.990
That's going to be the rear corners of the plane. So we're off to a good start.

181
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:42.680
If that's a little bit off, you can kind of fudge your squash folds to match,

182
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:47.090
but if you've taken care to line up these creases with the center line on each

183
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:49.970
side, it should be okay. So again,

184
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.930
I squashed it and now I'm moving that top flap back and we've got

185
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.720
homeboy. You can start to see it's getting complicated. Look at all that.

186
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:00.830
That's just amazing.

187
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.210
So the next move we're going to do is a complex move called a pedal fold.

188
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.720
And we're gonna start our pedal fold by taking these two little raw edges here

189
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.020
just to the center. So we're working with the top flap here.

190
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.700
I just go to the center. I missed a little bit there. Can you see,

191
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.140
I missed just a little bit down there.

192
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.820
I'm going to straighten that right there and just pull it up until I can

193
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:23.654
straighten it.

194
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.890
And I'm going to do this side just in that we're getting ready to do.

195
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.820
So we've got the two preliminary moves done for the pedal fold.

196
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.950
What we're going to do now is open up those two moves and to make

197
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:49.160
a pedal fold. We're going to need to do three more creases on the inside here.

198
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.000
So a new crease is going to go at the end, right straight across at the end,

199
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.940
these two creases we made in preparation.

200
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:58.390
And then you're going to make two creases that go here.

201
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:00.910
So we're going to actually make a little triangle inside there,

202
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.190
but it's actually easier than you think.

203
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.950
So what we're going to do is lift this top layer,

204
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.940
just the top layer here of this big triangle.

205
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.280
We're lifting it up and we're going to use as the limit,

206
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.300
these little creases that we made here so that the limit is going to be this

207
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:19.080
corner right here in this corner right here. That's going to be the limit.

208
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.400
So we're going to lift up this layer and we're going to start to form this

209
00:12:23.401 --> 00:12:26.370
crease that goes straight across between the ends of those two creases.

210
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.470
And we're just going to bend it right there for now.

211
00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:32.430
We're not going to definitely make a crease. So bend it right there where this,

212
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.430
these two creases meet this crease underneath and the crease on top.

213
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.870
So that's going to be a pivot point.

214
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.830
So we're going to follow the crease on the bottom, um, on both sides.

215
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.850
So we've got the crease on the both sides on the bottom, uh,

216
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.710
going up and now we're going to bend this up,

217
00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:51.600
keep moving it up until we bring together these two sides until

218
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:55.710
they meet right here at the center crease, we're using the center crease, uh,

219
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.530
as a way, the center crease right here, you can see right there,

220
00:12:58.531 --> 00:12:59.221
the center crease,

221
00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:04.170
we're using that as a way to line up the sides that we're

222
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:08.160
moving to the inside here. So we're just kind of wrapping this around,

223
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.380
using the center crease as where the points of this is going to come out.

224
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.070
And now we want to start definitely making the creases in here

225
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.720
from the center point down to the corners here

226
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.550
can kind of give it a little more attention by pressing right there.

227
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.880
And you can still see, we haven't made our crease across here,

228
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:30.840
but now we're going to do that.

229
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:33.690
We're going to lift that up and making the crease right there.

230
00:13:33.691 --> 00:13:38.520
Now that is the completed pedal fold. And now that I've got it done,

231
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.880
it looks so easy, but here's where we started. We started here.

232
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.550
We were like this, we folded this in. We folded this in,

233
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.570
and now you can see where the new creases are going to go. This is a valuable,

234
00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:54.930
these two are mountains. And we start by lifting that up,

235
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.210
following these creases on the bottom,

236
00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:01.230
those are going right where we wanted to go follow those on the bottom and

237
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:03.120
that'll pull the layers to the inside.

238
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.100
And then you work that up into a point here.

239
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.730
And then the last move is to push that point and flatten it out.

240
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.910
And once you got this fancy schmancy thing, all done, now,

241
00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:17.970
the evil really starts, okay, we're going to pull this apart.

242
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.320
And we're going to grab onto these two legs and pull out

243
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.370
kind of like you see my thumbs kind of going under his isn't pulling out.

244
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.670
And then that crease should, if you can pull it up, it'll pop like that.

245
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.960
And then you just push it in there and using the same creases. Um,

246
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.950
no new creases. They're just using the same creases. It'll go up and inside.

247
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.910
Crazy, crazy, crazy. But that's not as crazy as it's going to get.

248
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.080
We're about to get even crazier. Now we're going to start making these canards.

249
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.410
You can see how these guys are sweeping out.

250
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.820
So we're going to lift these up and sweep them out and then we're going to

251
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:57.140
narrow them eventually. So the first trick is to make sure that you know,

252
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:59.420
where the point is underneath it, just kind of the braille method,

253
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.330
that little point underneath that we made go up,

254
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.660
we're going to use as a limit for how much we're going to lift this up.

255
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.570
So this guy is going to start to get reversed.

256
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:10.970
We're going to change the direction of this crease right here.

257
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.750
We're going to pop that out and change the direction of that crease.

258
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.040
And we're going to lift it up,

259
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.270
but we're going to use that point inside as the limit for how high that goes.

260
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:25.460
So our little point is right here, inside here, you can kind of feel it.

261
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.240
This layer is going to get reversed. That crease gets reversed,

262
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:32.210
and we're going to lift it just for that to where the point ends there,

263
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.490
you'll be able to feel it pretty definitely.

264
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.080
Now the tricky thing is to squash this whole flat, this whole thing flat,

265
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.350
cause it's just bulging up in the air, doing nothing definite here.

266
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:44.870
So we're now we're going to have to start shaping it.

267
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:47.510
We've got this crease going right where it needs to go.

268
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.080
So from the back side, from the under layers,

269
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:53.090
let's work our way from the bottom to the top.

270
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.650
So what's going to happen at the bottom layer is we're going to make a crease

271
00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:01.070
that goes from up in there, out to this point here. So let's do that

272
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.320
so way up there where this point is buried underneath,

273
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.600
we're going to go make a crease that goes from that point down to

274
00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:12.680
this corner right here.

275
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:17.180
So this is the backside of that flap that we reversed the direction of the may

276
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.880
increase on. We're just going to make a crease that goes there.

277
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.260
And now we're gonna follow this crease here, pressing that down,

278
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.370
and you'll see that there's some Slack happening right here.

279
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.590
And so to make the top layer crease, we're just going to press this down.

280
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.770
Try to line up the crease with the, the bottom layer.

281
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:41.720
Cause this is a really hard move by the way, very complex. So take your time.

282
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.770
You'll need to watch this a couple of times to probably get it. Uh that's okay.

283
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.650
So now it looks like that. Now we do the same thing to the other side. Again,

284
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.030
the first move is reversing the direction of this crease right here.

285
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:58.460
So we're going to pop it up and we're going to let it reverse all the way up

286
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:03.170
to where the other one ends. Just make sure it's in a matching point there,

287
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.340
start moving it over so that we can make the bottom layer crease here.

288
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.690
It's going up inside there all the way down to this corner here.

289
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.080
That's the first part of this assembly.

290
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.400
And now we're going to start pressing it flat by using this long crease that we

291
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:29.350
reversed, press it down. You have to press inside there.

292
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.410
You can see this little triangle form right there, right there.

293
00:17:32.411 --> 00:17:35.900
These little triangles should be about the same size on each side. Zoom in.

294
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.180
You'll see those little triangles a little more.

295
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:41.140
Definitely those little guys forum as a result of the too much Slack here.

296
00:17:41.141 --> 00:17:42.850
So we've created this.

297
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.930
What's going to be the forward canard of the plane right there.

298
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.510
So this started down like this. We lift this up, reversing that full,

299
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:57.270
and then we make this crease and then press this and press the top

300
00:17:57.271 --> 00:18:00.000
triangle back down, which forms this little triangle right there.

301
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.780
And of course you do that on both sides. We're not done. As you can see,

302
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.200
the canard is a little bit thinner than the flap we've got there.

303
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:09.120
So now we've got to start narrowing that flap.

304
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:13.410
So step one on doing that is to take this edge right here,

305
00:18:13.411 --> 00:18:14.340
this raw edge here,

306
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.970
we're going to lift this whole flap up and over and line it up with the right

307
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.970
hand side there. This long crease that we just made

308
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.660
with that one there, we're going to do the same thing on this side.

309
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.720
This raw edge goes against this new crease that we just made right there.

310
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.610
Okay. So this is another difficult fold.

311
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:36.360
If you can make it pass this you're going all the way. I know these were hard.

312
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.140
This is even weirder. This is a little weirder. So hang in there.

313
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.530
This is where the old magic starts to happen right here. Okay.

314
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.780
We're going to unfold this,

315
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.910
lifting the top layer and using the end of that crease that we just made as a

316
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:53.310
reference, you can hold that down with your thumbnail.

317
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:56.100
You're going to lift the top layer top layer only.

318
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.150
And we're going to make a crease that goes from right here for this little

319
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:03.720
reference crease ended all the way out to this corner right here. So

320
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.850
top layer only making the crease going out to that corner

321
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.190
can run your finger down inside, right to the corner,

322
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:15.960
that pocket there's one layer done.

323
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:21.330
Now we're going to lift the layer that we left behind, swing this back down,

324
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:22.860
lift both of those layers together.

325
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:26.010
And you can see this guy started to pop for pulling that upward.

326
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.610
So this layer here is going to get pulled up or we're going to make a new crease

327
00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:32.400
that goes up this way on this layer right here.

328
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:34.830
So those two guys lift those together

329
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.580
and you can see this is pulling up, pulling up, pulling up.

330
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:40.950
So start to form a crease that goes from right here,

331
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:43.170
all the way down to this corner right here.

332
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.470
So let's just push that over and make that crease.

333
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:51.980
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

334
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.460
<v 1>Make sure this is staying in the right position, making that crease,</v>

335
00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:58.850
and then you'll make a new crease up here as that comes together.

336
00:19:58.851 --> 00:20:00.410
Now I missed a little bit,

337
00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:02.720
you can see that I missed it just a little bit right here.

338
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.740
I'm just a little below that Mark. That's okay. Don't worry about that. Uh,

339
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:11.150
just try to get it in the same spot for this side. It's not critical. Uh,

340
00:20:11.151 --> 00:20:12.260
but if you miss a little bit,

341
00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:15.590
it's way more important to get this whole assembly kind of looking like this in

342
00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:19.040
this corner ends up being kind of important for the looks of the plane later.

343
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:20.720
So now that you've got that going,

344
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.350
we're just going to lift this up and tuck that underneath. And there we go.

345
00:20:24.351 --> 00:20:27.620
You can kind of see that now that canard is really starting to form there.

346
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.450
So let's do the same thing to this side.

347
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.440
We're going to unfold that we're going to use our thumbnail as a limit there,

348
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.410
and I'm going to cheat it down just so it ends up in the same place as my other

349
00:20:36.411 --> 00:20:40.040
fold. There we go. Now those corners are matching it.

350
00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:43.100
You'll never see the error. Okay.

351
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.380
Unfolding out to the outside edge there,

352
00:20:45.381 --> 00:20:48.550
the outside corner that is making that crease.

353
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:49.470
<v 2>Trying to get.</v>

354
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.580
<v 1>The lineup with the mistake that I made before. Okay,</v>

355
00:20:53.581 --> 00:20:54.930
there's the underlayer done.

356
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.740
Now I'm going to swing that back down and lift both of those at the same time,

357
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.230
which is going to cause this layer to start pulling up.

358
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.110
So lay that flat,

359
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.030
continue to pull that layer up and make the new crease from this corner.

360
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.500
<v 2>Right here, all the way down to this corner right here.</v>

361
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.720
Rolling that over, getting that corner in place,

362
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.120
flattening it and flattening this part

363
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.043
right up here.

364
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.860
<v 1>So I didn't, it wasn't perfect. It's a little bit off, but you know what?</v>

365
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:26.910
I'm not gonna, I'm not.

366
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.950
<v 2>Gonna sweat that. That's uh, that's.</v>

367
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.510
<v 1>It looks like a giant error right here right now. Um, but you know what?</v>

368
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.490
It's not going to affect the plane flight.

369
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.110
That's one where we're just going to go.

370
00:21:37.111 --> 00:21:40.230
That's between you and I is that we're not going to tell anybody about that one.

371
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.200
We get a little bit of a mistake right there. Uh,

372
00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:45.780
we're gonna straighten it up on the next move that we're going to do here.

373
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.670
This is where, this is how we're going to hide that one.

374
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.160
So now we're going to start to move these flaps back to the outside.

375
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.790
And I'm going to fold this over in the lip, this top flap.

376
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.210
<v 2>I'm going to fold this over, just right at that corner.</v>

377
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.540
<v 1>I'm going to go from this corner all the way down to this corner and moving this</v>

378
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:04.703
flap back to the house.

379
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.270
<v 2>Side. Here we go.</v>

380
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.190
And we'll do this.

381
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.980
<v 1>The same thing on this side, the corner from this only,</v>

382
00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:14.880
I'm not going to go to that corner.

383
00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:16.290
I'm going to go right here where this guy is.

384
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.830
<v 2>Right here. Okay.</v>

385
00:22:19.831 --> 00:22:21.600
So moving now.

386
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.490
<v 1>Back up, I'm going to go just short.</v>

387
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.410
This is where I'm going to level this guy up right.

388
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.090
<v 2>Here. Just short.</v>

389
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.880
<v 1>Right there, where that one matches. And then I'm gonna go down to this corner.</v>

390
00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.250
<v 2>And that my friend is how you hide a tiny folding over.</v>

391
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.370
<v 1>Those corners came out in the right place.</v>

392
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.260
<v 2>And what that layer slipped just a little bit.</v>

393
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.060
It was cause I was playing games there. So I'm gonna remake that,

394
00:22:48.061 --> 00:22:50.070
holding that in place. Okay, there we go.

395
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.340
That's better now that's laying flat.

396
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.530
<v 1>We're going to do a little reverse fold move here because it'll lock together</v>

397
00:22:58.531 --> 00:23:01.320
and hold together a little bit more nicely. If I,

398
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.090
instead of just leaving that loose like that,

399
00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:04.500
I'm going to tuck this under a little bit.

400
00:23:04.501 --> 00:23:06.570
So I've got two layers kind of compressing it together.

401
00:23:06.571 --> 00:23:09.660
So reverse fold works like this.

402
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.380
We're going to unfold that we're going to follow the bottom layer and reverse

403
00:23:13.381 --> 00:23:14.460
this top layer here.

404
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.180
So this edge is going to end up going the different direction.

405
00:23:18.181 --> 00:23:19.740
That's why it's called reverse Filbert,

406
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.140
actually going to reverse this big crease here.

407
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.180
We're going to recreate this a little bit right here,

408
00:23:24.181 --> 00:23:27.150
but that's not the reversing part. This is the reversing part,

409
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.020
flattening that following the bottom layer,

410
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.000
pushing that big crease to the all the way up inside there and I've reversed it.

411
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:39.570
So it was down here like this and kind of like closing a milk curtain and

412
00:23:39.571 --> 00:23:44.310
pushing that in following this bottom layer is going to go the same direction

413
00:23:44.311 --> 00:23:47.480
it's going in this top layer. You can see it was like that.

414
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.280
And then it's going to turn into a mountain.

415
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:53.330
Fold is I pushed this layer in and reverse that,

416
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:57.650
that crease there, this turns into a mountain full, okay.

417
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.710
That's one side done. We're no new creases here.

418
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:02.570
We're just manipulating the old creases.

419
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:05.900
So I'm going to make this reverse fold here because it's going to reverse this

420
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:09.530
little part. I'm lifting this up, pressing this crease.

421
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:12.470
That's going to reverse and pressing as flat, pressing it to the inside.

422
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.110
And it goes swings out like that.

423
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.620
So now all we have to do is a little bit of shaping.

424
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.560
What we're going to start with is folding the plane in half,

425
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.720
right down the center line. Let's flip it over.

426
00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:27.140
So the relatively smooth side is up. We're going to rotate it.

427
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:31.220
So the nose is pointed, left, and then right down the old pipeline here,

428
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.720
just following the existing crease. Now when you're making the wing crease,

429
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:40.520
the cool thing here about this plane is that you can see this old style dart.

430
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.730
The classic dart is kind of in the heart of this thing and it's populated by all

431
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:47.720
this other high-tech stuff. But to get the old school dart, look,

432
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:52.010
we're going to use this edge and bring it right down to the center crease that.

433
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.440
<v 2>We just made really easy to do with the nose.</v>

434
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.560
<v 1>You have tons of room to line up right here at the nose.</v>

435
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.750
<v 2>And so you'll get that going that direction and then bring it down.</v>

436
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.350
And you have to play a little bit of peek-a-boo here with the center crease.

437
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.780
<v 1>You can see it pretty easily right there. I'm gonna move in a little bit.</v>

438
00:25:07.781 --> 00:25:10.540
You can see it even better here. You can see it right here.

439
00:25:10.541 --> 00:25:12.810
You're going to line up right there and then just.

440
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.430
<v 2>Do the best you can, as it goes back toward the rear of the plane.</v>

441
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:18.670
So get it going the right direction. Kind of start pressing it.

442
00:25:18.671 --> 00:25:23.110
And then go ahead and start creasing it sweeping, left, sweeping, right?

443
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.310
Okay.

444
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.080
<v 1>And that's looking pretty good. Let's flip it over.</v>

445
00:25:26.081 --> 00:25:27.160
We'll make the other way match. Of.

446
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.993
<v 3>Course.</v>

447
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.920
<v 1>So now the important thing is you've got these two rear corners on every paper</v>

448
00:25:32.921 --> 00:25:35.290
airplane. That's what you want to pay attention to those two.

449
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.820
<v 2>Corners, this and this. And of course, we're going to use our lineup right here.</v>

450
00:25:39.821 --> 00:25:43.270
Again, let's get the nose going, just going to bend it over.

451
00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:45.370
And I could really get to make a fine crease here yet.

452
00:25:45.371 --> 00:25:49.210
We're just going to bend it into position and then continue to bend this over.

453
00:25:49.211 --> 00:25:54.190
Now you're going to carefully line up these rear corners and start making a

454
00:25:54.191 --> 00:25:57.580
bend in there before you make a real crease, get it lined up,

455
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.220
start to press a little bit harder.

456
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.130
And then we're going to sweep toward the back of the plane.

457
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.100
Make sure those corners are staying lined up.

458
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.010
As you sweep toward the back of the plan and get a little bit of air go in

459
00:26:09.011 --> 00:26:09.670
there.

460
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:13.570
There we go back on track sweep to the back of the plane and then start sweeping

461
00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:16.240
to the front of the plane. Get that locked down in position.

462
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.670
<v 1>Now your canards could be a little bit offer. You can see it's not perfect. Uh,</v>

463
00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:24.280
but that's okay. Uh, what you're going to do to,

464
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.120
to level this thing up to even this up is you're going to make a crease for

465
00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:28.781
these winglets.

466
00:26:28.781 --> 00:26:33.190
Now look at the way the crease goes right down the winglets so that it stays in

467
00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:36.220
a straight line right here. That's what you're looking for.

468
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.720
And you're looking for it to be parallel with the main wind grease and in a

469
00:26:40.721 --> 00:26:45.420
straight line right there. So if you look at it right down the barrel here,

470
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.260
you can see those that's one straight line right down the winglets.

471
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:50.400
That's what you're shooting for.

472
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.420
So let's start with the rear wing lit and we're going to use this corner right

473
00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:58.050
here as kind of a reference. And you can see the angle that we're aiming for.

474
00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.993
<v 2>Right here.</v>

475
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.190
Move that up a little bit. That looks pretty good.

476
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.130
Okay. I'm going to go ahead.

477
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.500
<v 1>And make that, that looks pretty tight. Pretty.</v>

478
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.333
<v 2>Correct.</v>

479
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.590
<v 1>We're going to make this,</v>

480
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:20.360
we're just going to continue on just like we're making one solid crease up

481
00:27:20.361 --> 00:27:22.760
there. We're just going to continue this line right through here.

482
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.860
<v 2>And we'll do the best we can to Elaine this up and make it even</v>

483
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.580
that's given me a little bit of trouble right there.

484
00:27:34.581 --> 00:27:37.070
So when gonna back up and take one more run out of here,

485
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.660
that looks pretty good. Okay.

486
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.170
<v 1>So that came up pretty straight,</v>

487
00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.570
straight line between those creases right there.

488
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.050
That's looking good and no matter how straight it came out,

489
00:27:51.051 --> 00:27:54.650
when we do the other side, we're going to make these layers match.

490
00:27:54.651 --> 00:27:57.680
And so the key thing here, when we flip it over to do the other side,

491
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.320
you start paying attention more to that bottom layer. You,

492
00:28:02.321 --> 00:28:03.680
you do want it to be parallel here,

493
00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:06.710
but really what you're doing is you want to make this wing match the other wing.

494
00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:08.540
So roll it carefully,

495
00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:12.650
roll it over until you can just line up with the edge below.

496
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.330
So what you're doing is just,

497
00:28:14.331 --> 00:28:17.510
just carefully rolling over and double-checking underneath there that you're

498
00:28:17.511 --> 00:28:19.910
lining it up right on top of that.

499
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.370
<v 2>Other edge. And then as a last.</v>

500
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.880
<v 1>Check, just take a look at this, this edge here. So that all looks pretty good.</v>

501
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.110
<v 2>Lining up that edge that comes up pretty parallel.</v>

502
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.630
And what we're going to do here.

503
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.180
<v 1>Is now do the same thing with the front wing. Lit.</v>

504
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:40.550
<v 2>Just get that going. Looks like we're pretty close in line with this.</v>

505
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.210
Okay. Looking good.

506
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.390
<v 1>Winglets are done. They're folded. Anyway.</v>

507
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.770
Now it's all about the adjusting and there's some really delicious adjusting

508
00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:54.080
with regard to this plane. So the first thing we're going to do,

509
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:58.760
unlike most a great paper airplanes, not a lot of dihedral angle here.

510
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:03.590
We're going to set the wings fairly flat because these winglets are going to add

511
00:29:03.591 --> 00:29:04.970
what's called effective.

512
00:29:04.971 --> 00:29:09.080
Dihedral they're going to cause the wingtip or dis-ease to shed really cleanly.

513
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.520
And they're going to really help the plane resist rolling, left or rolling.

514
00:29:13.521 --> 00:29:15.890
Right? And as long as these are straight up and down,

515
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.050
what you've got here is effective.

516
00:29:18.051 --> 00:29:22.310
Dihedral from these upwards swept wing tips, uh, both ways.

517
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.420
It also gives it really good structural integrity all the way down the length of

518
00:29:26.421 --> 00:29:27.254
the plane.

519
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.760
<v 2>Um, and then.</v>

520
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.460
<v 1>What this plane is known for is being stall resistant and to add the stall</v>

521
00:29:34.461 --> 00:29:38.690
resistance. What we're going to do is increase the angle of incidents.

522
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.770
That is the amount of tilt on this wing.

523
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.220
Now stalls are caused by two things.

524
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.920
If the plane is flying too slowly,

525
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.470
the airflow just can't follow the shape of the wing.

526
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.540
So the Coanda effect doesn't have a chance to have its way

527
00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.820
to follow the surface of the wing. So if too slow, a flight is happening,

528
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.310
the airflow comes unglued. That's called a stall.

529
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.870
And if the plane is tilted up too much with regard to the airflow,

530
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.720
if it's just trying to angle up and fly like that,

531
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:12.280
too much of the airflow is going like this.

532
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.580
The airflow can't easily follow the shape of the wing.

533
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.950
And so the airflow comes unglued and no more downward, uh,

534
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:26.320
uh, vectoring off the trailing edge of the plane and therefore no more lift.

535
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.830
It's a loss of lift. So stall is really just a loss of lift,

536
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:32.350
a loss of laminar flow over the wing,

537
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.360
and it's not making any more lift and we call that a stall.

538
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.310
So what we're doing here is intentionally making the little wing stall by adding

539
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.750
more angle of incidence here, tilting that upward more. So when the plane,

540
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:51.040
the whole plane is close to stall phase because this little wing is tilted up a

541
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:54.760
little bit more. It's going to stall first, that'll drop the nose down,

542
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.960
which now causes the plane to pick up speed and reduces the angle of incidents

543
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:02.500
on the main wing here so that it never gets to stall phase.

544
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.380
So it's a really tricky little design. Um,

545
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:09.160
you've got a little bit of upward sweep here on the canard and then what we're

546
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:12.760
going to do of course, because it is a glider and an engine list plane.

547
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.730
We're going to add some up elevator right back here,

548
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.980
right there.

549
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.770
That is a really great looking plane. Pull back out just a little bit.

550
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:27.370
Give yourself a little bit of room there to swing the sky around you,

551
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:31.000
show you every angle of this guy. Look at that. What a gorgeous looking plane.

552
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:34.960
You can see that old style dart front to back there really cool

553
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.110
forward canard making it stall resistant,

554
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.240
and then that nice broad rear wing they're gorgeous planes will fly

555
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:45.790
pretty good distance, but here's the issue with this guy.

556
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.510
Look at all of these layers under your that's really going to cause a lot of

557
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:50.770
drag underneath the plane.

558
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:54.550
All the air flow does is get tripped up on all those little layers everywhere.

559
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.260
And so it's slowing it down. That's a dragon deucing thing. All those layers,

560
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.330
even all these layers right here at the nose,

561
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.220
see all that thickness happening right there.

562
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:07.930
It's just not quite as clean as it needs to be to get a world record going.

563
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:12.460
But what a fantastic looking plane.

564
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.710
<v 4>Okay.</v>
