00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>I'd like to think that the dumbest one that was pitched is in the</v>

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:06.690
game. I can't imagine us going. Wow.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.810
That's really dumb that doesn't belong in a friendship. No dumb,

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:14.010
funny things is what all friendship moves are about. Hi, my name is ed boon.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.680
I am the creative director at another realm studios.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.360
We are about to go through every single friendship move in mortal Kombat 11.

7
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.510
A friendship move is a friendly version of a fatality.

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.590
After the reactions to some of our fatalities from the early mortal combat

9
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:43.880
games, we decided to create the Antifa fatality friendship.

10
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.550
A friendship is a childish, funny,

11
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.260
novel finishing move that the players can do when they don't want to really do

12
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:54.710
something too violent. And we're going to cover all 37 characters,

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.480
including our three new fighters,

14
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.060
rein Molina and Rambo who joined the roster as part of mortal Kombat 11 ultimate

15
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.350
and combat pack to

16
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.710
Baraka's friendship moves actually based on his friendship,

17
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:12.380
moved from mortal combat to way back in the nineties,

18
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.350
we had much less sophisticated presentation.

19
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:18.920
Baraka used to just take out a present and present it to his opponents.

20
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.450
Now in 2020, we can do much more of an elaborate performance.

21
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.090
Now he takes out the Cape, he throws it up in the air.

22
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.480
He cuts it up and there's just this big new mess.

23
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.050
So we're just kinda playing on that original idea,

24
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.950
but updating it with a much more elaborate presentation.

25
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.790
Cassie's friendship move is kind of like our social commentary on what younger

26
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.430
people are doing these days. And so it's all about the selfie.

27
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:53.480
It's all about social media and creating a persona.

28
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.680
It's funny that she went through this crazy brutal fight.

29
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.210
And then as a celebration,

30
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:09.530
she takes out her cell phone and begins to kind of document what she looked like

31
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:10.251
after the fight.

32
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:14.060
I always found that friendship move one of the more humorous ones in the game.

33
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.790
I think every single friendship move that we do,

34
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.800
it'll be one out of four or five ideas that are being pitched.

35
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.820
And then based on the complexity of it, how funny we think it is,

36
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.760
how dumb we think it is. If we think a friendship was dumb,

37
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:33.260
that's usually a really good sign.

38
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.730
The whole point of these things is to be silly, to be the opposite of vitality,

39
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:40.970
to get laughter out of somebody rather than shock,

40
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.970
because we have almost 40 friendship moves in the game.

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.350
A lot of the ones that we did not use, I've somehow forgotten all about sex.

42
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.350
If you're familiar with such Rianna,

43
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:55.130
she's all about balance and she's all about good and evil.

44
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.530
So her friendship move is also all about.

45
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.010
<v 1>Balance. It.</v>

46
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.710
<v 0>Brings up a tree, it's all about nature and everything,</v>

47
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:07.330
and then generates a swing and is the swinging and enjoying the

48
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.290
balance of nature. It's not an elaborate friendship,

49
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.110
but it certainly reflects her personnel.

50
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.730
<v 2>Divorced.</v>

51
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.030
<v 0>She has always had ties with the insect world.</v>

52
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.870
It actually starts out a little bit dramatic.

53
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.830
She turns into a cocoon and then the exact opposite of what you're expecting

54
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.040
happened. She basically burst out as a butterfly.

55
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.800
The irony of she's always been the most disgusting representation of

56
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:44.700
bugs and then kind of coming out at the other end of the spectrum with this

57
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:47.880
butterfly is quite fitting for her. If we were to give her a friendship.

58
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.500
<v 2>Aaron Black is a gunslinger.</v>

59
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.900
<v 0>We figured what is the most non-threatening use of guns that we can think of</v>

60
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.820
Love the way this friendship moves starts really dramatic.

61
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.300
You kind of see his head tilting up almost like a Clint Eastwood movie.

62
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.660
And then we quickly transition to a carnival shooting.

63
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.060
<v 2>Gallery and you see.</v>

64
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.840
<v 0>Glimpses of this idea used for other friendships.</v>

65
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:22.470
We're going to see something similar to that in the future, but this whole,

66
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.360
how quickly he does a quick shot is probably one of my favorite kind of like

67
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.540
setting that's created in this friendship with Aaron Black.

68
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.780
<v 2>Frost.</v>

69
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.300
<v 0>Like Sub-Zero having this kind of cold power.</v>

70
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:38.340
You knew it was going to have something to do with ice.

71
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.530
We decided to make an ice skating rink.

72
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.590
One of my favorite things about this particular friendship is the

73
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:50.190
animations. We don't have an ice skating rink in our motion capture studio,

74
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.780
but somehow our animation team and mo-cap team duplicated the

75
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:58.950
feeling of ice skating. And so she's skating around the arena.

76
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.230
Her spinning move at the very end is,

77
00:05:01.231 --> 00:05:05.040
is particularly funny just because her head stays still while her body kind of

78
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:05.730
rotates it.

79
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.350
I still don't know how those guys pull that one off much of what gives the

80
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:15.330
realism in terms of the feel and look with our games is the fact that we grab a

81
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:17.910
lot of our animations through motion capture.

82
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:19.920
So we have motion capture talent come in.

83
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.830
We actually have them perform the moves for frost.

84
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.490
What was so particularly exciting is the fact that we did not have a skating

85
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:28.440
rink so we could not capture it live,

86
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.030
but our animators can really perform miracles as far as getting the

87
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.720
perfect look and feel. So it was a combination of motion capture,

88
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:39.600
but a lot of animation magic put on top of it.

89
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.260
<v 2>That Fujin is the God of wind.</v>

90
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.550
<v 0>Naturally. We wanted to have his friendship move be of him flying a kite.</v>

91
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.720
He experiences all the struggles that a kid does trying to get the kite in the

92
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:59.000
air. He decides to use his powers, make the kite get off the ground.

93
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.590
What's so funny about this friendship for me is that he's actually skipping,

94
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.820
he's skipping like a child,

95
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:09.350
which is so kind of in the spirit of what friendship moves are. In retrospect,

96
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.940
I wish that we had Raiden come out. Who's food brother flying the kite together.

97
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:17.150
I think it would have been just that extra kind of own for it,

98
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.720
but we could not be happier with how this friendship movie turned out.

99
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:24.440
It's easily. One of the most playfulness in the entire game

100
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.710
Garris is one of the more, almost random and confusing friendship moves.

101
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.380
<v 1>We really.</v>

102
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.101
<v 0>Were kind of thinking,</v>

103
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:37.580
what do you do with somebody who has control over the sands of time?

104
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:40.700
And of course you take those sands and build a sandcastle.

105
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.810
One of the funny details I love about it is the concentration that Charisse has

106
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.690
as he's pudding that last flag on the top of the castle,

107
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.980
he's got his tongue sticking out.

108
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:54.470
Like he just wants to put it in the exact right place.

109
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.860
My favorite part is his arms folding at the end,

110
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.240
looking at his masterpiece. And he's so happy and proud of it,

111
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.570
that facial expression really sells the whole thing for me.

112
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.830
Every single thing that we can do now is something I wish we had back in the

113
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:14.780
day. The technical struggles way back in the nineties were as

114
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:18.590
big of a challenge as coming up with the original ideas.

115
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.390
You came up with the ideas and that was great,

116
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.060
but then how do you do it when you're kind of inside this box?

117
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:26.540
Now the box is gigantic. It's a much different challenge,

118
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.540
but the capabilities are almost limitless.

119
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.373
<v 1>At this point.</v>

120
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.680
<v 0>Jade's friendship is based on her staff. And when we were thinking, what,</v>

121
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.880
what do kids do with something like a staff? The idea came up up, up Kenyatta.

122
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.060
So Jade swinging her staff at UPenn,

123
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.400
Jada and hundreds of pieces of candy flying out is a very fun friendship move

124
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:50.330
for the team to make.

125
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.470
What I love is the nuance of her clapping is so happy with herself,

126
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.490
sitting down with her legs crossed and being almost kind of overwhelmed at how

127
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:02.000
much candy is in front of her excitement, almost taking over her.

128
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.250
And she doesn't even know which piece of candida it takes.

129
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:08.480
So she's kind of frantically grabbing every piece of candy that she can even

130
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:10.550
spot that lasts moments there,

131
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:14.720
where she's just in bliss is really what sells this friendship move.

132
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.470
Most of the time we look at the character in terms of their abilities or

133
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:22.490
something about their costume that really stands out based on those ideas,

134
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:26.510
what is reasonable for us to create? We will pick the right one,

135
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:31.010
but normally there is a thread of a connection between the

136
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.110
character and the friendship move.

137
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:37.700
Sometimes it's a lot more of a obvious connection and sometimes it's a bit of a

138
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:38.151
stretch,

139
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:42.170
but those ones that are a bit of a stretch are actually sometimes the funnest.

140
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.003
<v 1>Ones.</v>

141
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.770
<v 0>Jackie's friendship is the character wanted to do something,</v>

142
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.880
something screwed up. And that's the kind of visual gag.

143
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.300
Jackie takes out like a punching bag and she's using these kind of high-tech

144
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.990
arms, you know, kind of showing them off, punching this kind of rocking,

145
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.800
punching bag.

146
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.820
She thinks that she gave it the final blow and then it surprises Jackie and the

147
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:09.120
audience and hits her, obviously, because it's a friendship,

148
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.050
she doesn't get upset about it, but it's certainly a bit of a surprise.

149
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:14.550
And that's the kind of visual gag.

150
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:19.080
So hers is kind of like the first something went wrong scenario that we have in

151
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:22.950
the game. Jack's his friendship move.

152
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.830
You can almost call Jack's plays the sax.

153
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.640
<v 3>He is one of the.</v>

154
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.200
<v 0>The simplest, but stylized friendship moves in the game.</v>

155
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:38.030
The music and the camera are some of the biggest parts of what gives this

156
00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:39.380
friendship move the style.

157
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.670
He's got the subtle kind of dancing going the 70 shots with the multiple

158
00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:46.520
versions of jacks. I love the background graphics.

159
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.130
Some people don't notice that when he ends it,

160
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.160
he's actually playing the mortal Kombat theme.

161
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.460
I love those kinds of nuances that we put in there. Jordan, Johnny cage,

162
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.940
his friendship obviously has to be related to showbiz.

163
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.020
We wanted to add something unexpected. So he snaps his fingers.

164
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:11.030
The lights go out and suddenly we're on a stage and he does this little

165
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:16.100
dance number with a, a hat and cane. The dancing is purposefully hokey.

166
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:19.370
That's part of the charm of it is he's not professional dancer,

167
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:23.180
but he's so arrogant that he thinks he can pull any of that stuff off.

168
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.010
The little leg trick that he does at the very end is funny. And when he ends it,

169
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.190
his hands are kind of doing like a jazz hands thing.

170
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.190
If you watch that friendship move a number of times,

171
00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:36.470
you'll pick up on little nuances, just like that.

172
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.750
John Rambo's friendship is laser tag.

173
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.270
I love the way it starts.

174
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:48.170
It has a clear reference to the Rambo movies where he's suiting up.

175
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.540
You think that something serious is going on,

176
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.660
but when he clicks that gun and you see it light up, you know,

177
00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:55.460
something's different. And boom,

178
00:10:55.461 --> 00:11:00.110
we switched to this laser tag situation where he's in front of and hiding

179
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:04.280
behind the two inflatable cover walls. We go through a sequence of his head,

180
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.190
popping up, taking shots at opponents,

181
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.140
crawling between the two shooting in a variety of ways. It's a classic.

182
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.530
It's not what you think it is. Kind of scenario it'll.

183
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.600
<v 4>Be right between the eyes.</v>

184
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.280
<v 0>John Rambo helps finish out our goal of getting as many eighties action</v>

185
00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:27.200
stars in mortal combat. We've had Terminator. We've had Robocop.

186
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.290
You are under arrest dirt bag and now John Rambo.

187
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:35.060
So he really bookends that whole guest character roster that we have going.

188
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.630
<v 3>Shoes are either a benefit or a hazard.</v>

189
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.820
<v 0>The thing about the licensed characters that was such a pleasant surprise for us</v>

190
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.670
was that we make the characters do such silly things.

191
00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:48.800
We were really concerned that the,

192
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.970
the owners of the license would have an issue with us doing something as,

193
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.280
as yet, but with Rambo, with Robocop, with Terminator,

194
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.740
they were such great sports about it.

195
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:04.570
That was one of the most pleasant surprises in all of this was how enthusiastic

196
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:09.550
they were with having their characters play along in this silly portion of it.

197
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.350
<v 2>A game, which is the friendships joker.</v>

198
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.700
<v 0>It has been in a number of NRS games over the years in mortal Kombat 11.</v>

199
00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:20.850
It's probably the darkest representation that we've had.

200
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:25.350
It was fun to see him back again in a lighter tone, like Jackie,

201
00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:30.180
his friendship move is another, something went wrong. It starts off.

202
00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:33.690
He's trying to do something really sinister with a gun from out of the blue.

203
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.900
The battery comes out and hits him in the back of the head.

204
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.850
He actually even references Batman.

205
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.610
And then he switches over to taking out some balloons.

206
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.650
At the end of the day, he says, I'm sorry.

207
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:50.940
So it's kinda like the batarang kinda snapped him back into place into the more

208
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.530
kinder, gentler joker.

209
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.580
We really wanted to have it be like a hint of Batman.

210
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.050
We certainly didn't want to have him just come out and then everybody's going to

211
00:13:01.051 --> 00:13:04.830
be wanting to play him. If we actually created his model for the game,

212
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.480
we've used joker three times before a mortal Kombat versus DC and justice one

213
00:13:09.481 --> 00:13:12.300
and injustice two in the T rated games.

214
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.040
We didn't want to kind of go crazy with him in terms of his,

215
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:20.130
his violent side and in mortal Kombat 11 that's when everything kind of went

216
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:20.964
loose,

217
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.200
throwing joker into the mix with the mortal combat game.

218
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:30.000
That's when you really get the opportunity to take off all the rains and

219
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:31.350
have him do crazy.

220
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.980
<v 2>Six stuff, cabals friendship.</v>

221
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.520
<v 0>Probably one of the most random friendships in the game.</v>

222
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.930
He zips onto the screen.

223
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.940
<v 2>And there's this gigantic xylophone.</v>

224
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.020
<v 0>That he starts playing.</v>

225
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.580
Probably what I'm most impressed with this friendship is the animation.

226
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.480
It is perfectly synced to the music that is playing.

227
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.820
You would never think that those were two separate efforts that were done by

228
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.980
different team members. Again,

229
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.130
another subtle reference to the mortal combat song.

230
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.930
I don't know how they manage to time that so perfectly,

231
00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:11.790
that's a tribute to our animation and audio team working together as random

232
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:14.850
as it was. It's definitely one of the more entertaining friends.

233
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:18.690
<v 2>Cantaloupe.</v>

234
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.140
<v 0>It was one of our more direct friendship moves.</v>

235
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.670
Everybody thinks of Keno Australian shrimp on the Barbie.

236
00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:30.300
So in some respects, we had to do what we did.

237
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.560
<v 2>Kendall uses his eye laser to start.</v>

238
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.380
<v 0>A barbecue and he's got brought worse or something on there.</v>

239
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.910
If you look closely,

240
00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:42.450
you will notice that there are shrimp on that barbecue.

241
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.990
I wish we had him pick up a shrimp. It would have been a more direct reference,

242
00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:49.710
but for the people who are looking for those details, yes,

243
00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:53.090
I can confirm that are shrimp on that Barbie

244
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.780
Gitanos friendship move is probably the most friendliest and perhaps

245
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.830
innocent or child

246
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.980
Mortal Kombat 11 was released. Everybody has been clamoring for a Molina.

247
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.170
I used to kind of troll people by saying, you know,

248
00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:15.880
technically Molina is in the game because she's in Katana's

249
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.400
friendship, move where they play Patty cake.

250
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.830
They're traditionally very bitter rivals.

251
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.510
But the irony of seeing them play together like sisters who grew up together is

252
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.500
what is so cute about this friendship move. I love at the very end.

253
00:15:29.501 --> 00:15:33.280
There's like this nuance where they actually mess up and then they both realize

254
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.370
it. And they both laugh. That's what kind of like bonds them together.

255
00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:39.460
So they kind of give each other a big hug, realizing that they messed up.

256
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:44.350
They're just celebrating their, their sisterhood collectors.

257
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.350
Friendship is called a one man band friendship.

258
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.360
He pulls out a number of instruments. There's drums. There's a horn,

259
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:59.470
there's a flute, there's a guitar. And he's playing them all at the same time,

260
00:15:59.471 --> 00:16:01.870
a one man band. You really got to look at that one,

261
00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:06.460
a number of times to see the nuances that we put in that friendship move

262
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.260
again, everything is synced up from the cymbal, hits to the horns,

263
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.740
all perfectly synced with the music. The fact that he had forearms,

264
00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:15.640
I guess in reality,

265
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:20.140
we could have done that with Sheba or Gora or Tara or any one of the forearm

266
00:16:20.141 --> 00:16:20.741
characters,

267
00:16:20.741 --> 00:16:24.730
but the collector was the one who we thought it matched a little bit.

268
00:16:24.731 --> 00:16:28.060
He's probably a little bit more sophisticated than the monster type characters.

269
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.650
I'm sure that whoever animated it, it was a huge challenge to me. It's like,

270
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.470
like a hyper version of walking, chewing gum,

271
00:16:35.471 --> 00:16:37.360
rubbing your stomach at the same time.

272
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.860
The fact that it has to be in tune with the music and the individual four or

273
00:16:41.861 --> 00:16:44.140
five instruments that he's playing at the same time.

274
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.250
I can't imagine being the one who has to kind of coordinate all of those things

275
00:16:48.251 --> 00:16:49.084
together.

276
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:50.973
<v 2>Kinsey.</v>

277
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.040
<v 0>Cons friendship is perhaps the shortest and the simplest like Fujin.</v>

278
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.270
He is a character who has command of certain elements. Fujin with wind.

279
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.930
Cortile is with the sun. Obviously we thought, okay,

280
00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:07.930
let's have him pull out a lawn chair and get a suntan.

281
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:10.000
<v 2>He.</v>

282
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.730
<v 0>Pulls out a lawn chair, sits down,</v>

283
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.420
gets one of those reflective mirrors to make the most out of his

284
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.680
sunbathing and just chills. One of the nuances you notice, if,

285
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.980
if you stare at his face, he eventually closes his eyes.

286
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.040
I don't know if he's trying to fall asleep or if he's trying to make sure that

287
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:28.870
his eyelids get also get suntan,

288
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.310
the team put a light source because we really wanted his face to be lit up,

289
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.980
to put something above them and then have it reflect down.

290
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.220
Probably doesn't give us the kind of precision control that we want.

291
00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:42.040
But if you set a light point where the player can't see it,

292
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.940
you can really frame cuddles face with a lot more precision and detail.

293
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.680
Kung Laos friendship is one of the super childish little nuances that kids

294
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:55.410
do. It starts with his classic teleport.

295
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.790
And then when he pops up a train set appears around his hat,

296
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.100
which is just perfect for [inaudible].

297
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.010
And he is playing with the front engine of the train,

298
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.510
and then he spinning it around.

299
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.460
The nuances that I love of this friendship move is he's kicking his feet

300
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.580
like little kids do when they're watching TV or something like that.

301
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.880
Those little touches that the animation team,

302
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:21.810
the cinema team puts in there just gives it that little,

303
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:26.550
extra umph of childlike play that makes these friendship

304
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:30.420
moves, feel that much more silly, but in some ways,

305
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:35.160
endearing the old friendship where he throws his hat and the dog goes to

306
00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:37.050
fetch it. And if you keep in mind that his,

307
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:40.080
his hat is made of razors at the edge and your hair type,

308
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.900
a lot of people got that joke.

309
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.760
I think we didn't want to repeat that one just because things look so much

310
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:49.320
more real today.

311
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.010
I don't want to see like a dog that looks like a,

312
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.650
we help talk end up with that kind of demise.

313
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.350
Lou King's friendship is it's the return of the disco ball

314
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.900
like Baraka.

315
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:08.550
It's a remake of an old school friendship move that he had where a

316
00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:11.220
disco ball would come down and he would kind of do this dance

317
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.100
Back in the day. We had very little memory to do it.

318
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:20.430
So he would just kind of repeat the same animation over and over again.

319
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.760
This time it's a whole set.

320
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.270
You see the lights on the ground, you see the movements. He has choreography,

321
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.440
there's little hints of like a Saturday night fever point that he does the

322
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:38.940
nuance again of this one I love is he's a little bit awkward.

323
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.810
He's not a professional dancer. There's a certain awkwardness,

324
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.040
which I think is great.

325
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:48.930
It's a little endearing dorkiness that he has where he's doing the dance.

326
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.100
But at the end of the day, it's Lou King, he's got a lot of nobility.

327
00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:56.610
He hasn't really had much time to learn about dancing and it kind of shows.

328
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.050
<v 1>Molina.</v>

329
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.850
<v 0>Friendship. We can call the Teddy bear tea party.</v>

330
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.390
If you notice the three Teddy bears are a Teddy bear of Molina,

331
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:15.591
Katana and Jade.

332
00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:20.240
And they're kind of like our famous female ninjas in a sense,

333
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.670
whenever one of those characters is not in the game.

334
00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:25.760
Everybody is clamoring for whatever happened to this character.

335
00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:27.170
We've gone through that. A number of times,

336
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.620
I love the way that when Molina sets up this tea party,

337
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.460
she is constantly in the process of making things even better.

338
00:20:34.461 --> 00:20:37.250
She's adjusting the Teddy bears. She's pouring the tea,

339
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.160
her Teddy bear falls over. She picks it up. She's applauding.

340
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.710
She could not be happier to be there.

341
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.790
That tea party is just the perfect kind of summary of the

342
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.960
part of Molina. At the end of the day,

343
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:52.780
I kind of wish we had done one of those for the male ninjas,

344
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:56.080
or would have been cool to see scorpion Sub-Zero and rain or something,

345
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:59.080
do the same thing, but we were able to do it with the females.

346
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.220
And so that worked out great.

347
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:07.150
NyQuil's friendship is pretty much an animal act, almost like a circus act.

348
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.210
At first, he pulls out this ring lights on fire,

349
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:12.190
and you're just wondering if there's something more serious,

350
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.050
see a spirit Wolf come out.

351
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.490
What I love is the nuance of him tapping his leg and tasting the,

352
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:22.480
the Wolf to jump through the hoop. When it does, then everything cuts loose,

353
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.230
where the Eagles flying in. We see the bear in the background,

354
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.090
balancing on the ball, and it's just this big stage circus act.

355
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.840
What I found so entertaining about it is night Wolf, how Intuit he is, you know,

356
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.610
is just coaxing the Wolf to jump through the hoop and how proud he is

357
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:44.080
holding the Eagle at the very end, like I taught these animals how to do this.

358
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.150
That's such a funny situation to be set up.

359
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.920
This might actually be my favorite friendship. Move in the game easily.

360
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:57.430
It's in the top three, for me, it starts out with him, splitting into three,

361
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.400
has a clone and then a jump rope sequence.

362
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.890
This was a fun idea. I think it worked out great,

363
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.640
but it was absolutely sold by the performance.

364
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:14.350
One of our motion capture talent. His name is Nate. He just went crazy with it.

365
00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:16.630
So you see all the nuances.

366
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:21.190
I've never seen somebody in a motion capture studio have so much

367
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.720
fun contributing to the spirit of one of our

368
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.980
cinematic moments,

369
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.930
the ink splashes on the ground as his hands and his feet make contact with

370
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:35.230
it is such a rape detail of it. But again,

371
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.900
it's that performance and the animation.

372
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.970
I've never seen something communicate joy so much as to that guy

373
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.600
dancing and jumping rope. At the same time, it was just such a,

374
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:51.250
such a great performance Reagan's friendship.

375
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.590
Along with Lou King and Baraka,

376
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:58.540
and a number of other characters is a nod to their original friendship. Move.

377
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.520
Ravens was called kid thunder

378
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.160
And kid thunder makes a return in mortal Kombat,

379
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:11.080
11 a much more elaborate choreographed like dance

380
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:14.170
return. So Raiden summons can thunder.

381
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.750
And we hear that kind of familiar kid thunder yell.

382
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.770
We see this great light dance performance,

383
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.980
the detail of him doing that kind of break dance moment.

384
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.500
And you'll notice if you wait until the very end,

385
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.450
he kind of gives us look to his dad,

386
00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:30.970
almost like he's looking for approval or something like that.

387
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.050
You have to see those friendship moves a number of times to pick all of those up

388
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.150
Rain's friendship is the carnival water gun.

389
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.030
The way that it starts,

390
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.720
there's an irony to it because he's sitting in a carnival,

391
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:51.110
but the camera comes zooming at close and he's holding his finger like a gun.

392
00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:53.330
Like he's going to do some kind of action with it.

393
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.530
And then he points it at this party game that starts filling up the balloon.

394
00:23:57.531 --> 00:23:58.364
And it pops.

395
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.320
I love the way that the actual prize that he wins just falls from the sky and

396
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:07.460
he's holding it kind of real proud of it and decides to show off a little bit

397
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:10.070
more by creating a water spout coming from his hand.

398
00:24:10.071 --> 00:24:13.070
And that's kind of elevating the price that he just won.

399
00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:17.030
And it just kind of stays there with him in the sense of pride that he won this

400
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:17.990
ridiculous stuff.

401
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.100
<v 2>Animal meaning robot.</v>

402
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.520
<v 0>Cup's friendship is Robocop. Does the robot.</v>

403
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.840
It's a very retro dance sequence, which looks so ridiculous. Again,

404
00:24:31.841 --> 00:24:36.820
it's another example of how grateful we are that the owners of

405
00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:41.530
these licenses allowed us to do Robocop doing these eighties, nineties,

406
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.840
two thousands, dance nods,

407
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.590
the moonwalk and all the things is such a funny thing to see.

408
00:24:47.591 --> 00:24:51.250
And everybody will kind of make the connection Robocop doing the robot again.

409
00:24:51.251 --> 00:24:54.370
I'm so glad that they allowed us to do something as silly as that

410
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.150
the music and the performance. Again,

411
00:24:58.151 --> 00:25:01.870
this is another one of those friendships where the performance just carries it.

412
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.790
The motion captured that talent that we have,

413
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:07.930
and the animators just nailed the kind of spirit of what this friendship movie

414
00:25:07.931 --> 00:25:08.764
is trying to do.

415
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.070
<v 2>Skin scorpion.</v>

416
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.640
<v 0>Friendship, I guess you can call the, get over here, giant Teddy bear.</v>

417
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.830
It was one of the first friendships that we did where we kind of like set the

418
00:25:20.831 --> 00:25:23.560
tone of the remaining friendships in the game.

419
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.750
He looks like he's going through one of his victory moves where he throws his

420
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.830
spear out the camera's his dramatic angle,

421
00:25:29.831 --> 00:25:31.870
but instead of some victim being pulled in,

422
00:25:31.871 --> 00:25:34.750
it's this big Teddy bear and scorpion just starts hugging him.

423
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.360
One of the details that are in that particular friendship that I hope people

424
00:25:40.361 --> 00:25:43.420
pick up on is as he's hugging the Teddy bear,

425
00:25:43.421 --> 00:25:47.260
he looks up and he acknowledges the Teddy bear one more time and then continues

426
00:25:47.261 --> 00:25:51.940
to hug him. And it's, it's really, uh, so opposite of scorpion moment,

427
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.800
that kind of defines what the spirit of these friendship moves is intended to be

428
00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.590
Shang. Tsung's friendship is like some of the others,

429
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.310
a tribute to his mortal Kombat to friendship.

430
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.070
He basically just kind of creates this rainbow.

431
00:26:09.071 --> 00:26:12.370
And it's kind of like this universal symbol for love and everybody getting

432
00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:14.950
along, which is great this time,

433
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.090
he's has this sinister look on his face and he's creating this big spell that

434
00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:21.850
you think something bad is going to come out of. But then all of a sudden,

435
00:26:21.851 --> 00:26:25.090
he just reverts back to that pose with his arms in the air,

436
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.200
opening them up or feeling the rainbow and back to friendship.

437
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.980
It's a little bit of a trick there where he starts sinister,

438
00:26:32.981 --> 00:26:35.020
but then he kind of reverts back to that friendship.

439
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.010
But it's one of our quick and simple friendship moves in the game.

440
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:46.470
Shout con along Aaron Black and rain is a carnival

441
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:51.000
related friendship move. Everybody knows. Shout con he's the big hammer.

442
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.000
What do you do with a big hammer? You test your might in a sense.

443
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.150
And of course he shall con so he breaks the bell at the top,

444
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.830
everything shatters, and he's all proud of himself. That's his kind of,

445
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.680
I break the rules type of thing. And that's again,

446
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:09.060
the kind of trifecta of carnival games that we have in mortal Kombat, 11.

447
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.090
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

448
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.850
<v 0>Sheila's friendship is she plays the wineglasses.</v>

449
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.290
This is easily the quietest smoothest,

450
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.550
most mellow friendship that we have in the game with these characters that have

451
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.970
forearms. We really try to think of something novel for them to do.

452
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.930
And that Shiva at the end of the day, she probably would prefer piece.

453
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.960
And so we just put a whole bunch of wineglasses in front of her,

454
00:27:38.961 --> 00:27:43.610
and she's just using all four arms to play the soothing music, very Zen,

455
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.070
but also one of the more simple friendship moves in the game.

456
00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:47.510
There's nothing really complex about it.

457
00:27:47.511 --> 00:27:50.780
Just a whole bunch of wineglasses that she plays this little symphony on

458
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.450
Sendell's friendship is another quick and simple one. It's a bit of a gag.

459
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.890
She takes out a wineglass and Sandel is known for her voice,

460
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:07.580
her scream, her ability to do damage with this voice.

461
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.160
And so you think that she's going to scream and shatter the wineglass,

462
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.710
but as she is screaming,

463
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.530
the camera lens actually cracks.

464
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.300
She gives this sinister laugh and she just takes a

465
00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:25.610
sip of the wine because why not?

466
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.850
I love the kind of a little bit of a gag that's in it where you think she's

467
00:28:28.851 --> 00:28:31.310
going to do the obvious and then something else happens.

468
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.850
I think it might be our only friendship move that kind of breaks that fourth

469
00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:39.350
wall with the player. It's one of the kind of gag friendship moves in our games.

470
00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:43.730
There is no like physical object. That is the lens throughout the game.

471
00:28:43.731 --> 00:28:45.950
We use different fields of view,

472
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.260
depending on how dramatic we want to be with something,

473
00:28:48.261 --> 00:28:49.730
the mood that we're trying to set.

474
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.840
But that friendship is kind of playing on that where it's kind of like, Hey,

475
00:28:53.841 --> 00:28:57.170
don't forget, you're looking at this video game through a lens again,

476
00:28:57.171 --> 00:28:59.870
that's that little nuance of kind of breaking that fourth.

477
00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:00.703
<v 1>Wall.</v>

478
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:05.000
<v 0>Scarlet's friendship can be called the masterpiece.</v>

479
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.270
It starts out a little dark she's painting with blood.

480
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.600
She goes from precision where she's really concentrating.

481
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.470
And then she goes to these crazy moments where she's throwing blood at the

482
00:29:15.471 --> 00:29:17.930
canvas. You're wondering, what is this going to be?

483
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.900
Basically when she reveals it, it's a self portrait.

484
00:29:20.901 --> 00:29:23.810
It looks like a child painted. It makes no sense at all.

485
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.530
The detail that I love about this one is the facial expression that she has when

486
00:29:27.531 --> 00:29:32.120
it's done. It's such a childish painting, but as any artist would be,

487
00:29:32.121 --> 00:29:36.290
she's just as proud as has can be with this very basic self portrait.

488
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.820
Sonya blades. Friendship is probably one of the cuter friendships in the game.

489
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.370
She actually plays fetch with her robot and typical moral combat

490
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:50.680
fashion. That cute little drone,

491
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:55.150
which looks like an eighties movie robot comes back and it's dragging this dead

492
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:58.630
body. The irony being that Sonia, when she sees it,

493
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:03.130
she goes as if it's something that's really cute that the star of it is her

494
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.740
little robot and it's game of fetch.

495
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:08.680
<v 2>Stains.</v>

496
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.150
<v 0>Spawns friendship is probably the shortest, short and sweet,</v>

497
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.620
and it definitely demonstrates the opposite of a character's personality spawn,

498
00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:20.530
who is just the epitome of hell and violence.

499
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.480
<v 2>It's a special kind of hell. Isn't.</v>

500
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.730
<v 0>This crazy Cape suddenly showing him using the Cape as a hammock and</v>

501
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:29.710
he's reading relaxing again,

502
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:32.710
the music plays such a big part because it's the saxophone

503
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.940
Absolutely sets the mood.

504
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:41.860
It's just so not what you would expect spawn to do. And once again,

505
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.940
for the people who created spawn, who allowed us to do this,

506
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.440
we're very grateful.

507
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.570
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

508
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:56.010
<v 0>Sub zeros. Friendship is the ice cream truck or ice cream vehicle.</v>

509
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.560
It opens with the most ridiculous animation I'm,

510
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.160
Sub-Zero where he's randomly excited them and runs off the screen.

511
00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:04.830
And you're kind of wondering what, what, what are you so excited about it?

512
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.240
He comes back on the screen with this old school ice cream vehicle.

513
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.770
There's an umbrella overhead written on the cooler is Sub-Zero frozen treats.

514
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.900
You see Gorel with four cones,

515
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.080
one in each hand as scorpion where he dropped us cone.

516
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.290
Cause of course Sub-Zero and scorpion are still rivals at the end of the day.

517
00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:26.010
So he's not going to have a picture of scorpion having fun at the very end.

518
00:31:26.011 --> 00:31:29.700
He generates one of his, the popsicles with, with his freeze power.

519
00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:34.020
Of course it's so child is it's so ridiculous. That's why it works.

520
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.600
The Terminator's friendship is motorcycle tricks.

521
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.400
Terminator has one of his kind of like signature things is his big motorcycle

522
00:31:47.401 --> 00:31:51.300
that he rides on. We thought it would be funny to have him do stunts.

523
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.410
So he leaves.

524
00:31:52.411 --> 00:31:54.810
And then all of a sudden he's riding on the motorcycle and you're like, Oh,

525
00:31:54.811 --> 00:31:56.550
okay, he's going to just exit the scene.

526
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.880
But then he stands up on the motorcycle and he's balancing.

527
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.220
And that smile that he gives to the camera,

528
00:32:02.221 --> 00:32:06.850
that moment is probably the most entertaining part of that friendship.

529
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.460
And then he just begins a process of back and forth riding with handstand.

530
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.730
And then you see him popping a wheelie. There's a charm to it.

531
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:19.050
The fact that everybody knows that face and everybody knows how serious

532
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.880
Terminator traditionally is seeing Terminator with a smile goofing around in a

533
00:32:23.881 --> 00:32:26.820
friendship. Again, we're so grateful we were allowed to do that.

534
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.790
Just sells that friendship move perfectly.

535
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.210
So that is every friendship move in mortal Kombat 11.

536
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.620
That was a lot to cover.

537
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.760
I hope you learned a little bit about how we design these moves and maybe

538
00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.350
thought of a different way.

539
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.490
<v 2>To finish.</v>
