00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.950
<v 0>Hi, I'm Mackenzie Brown today.</v>

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.830
I'll be breaking down how archery is portrayed in video games.

3
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.000
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.580
<v 0>The video games. We'll be looking at our Assassin's creed.</v>

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.920
The last of us crisis,

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.050
the forest stranded deep thief horizon, zero Dawn,

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.810
the Witcher far cry and tomb Raider.

8
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's take a look at how archery skills are portrayed in video games, technique,

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.320
crisis three.

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.050
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.570
<v 0>The angle of the bow is over to the side.</v>

12
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.610
What we would call that is can't the arrow would potentially go

13
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:50.720
more to the right. It doesn't really give you much. It just kind of looks cool.

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.020
Same thing in crime movies and things like that,

15
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:56.570
where someone will point a gun and they'll aim it sideways.

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.000
I don't think that this is very helpful to aiming.

17
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.650
Our eyes are naturally want to line circle up with circle line with line and

18
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:09.860
notice the differences there. I think it's something to kind of look cool,

19
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:14.330
but it doesn't actually help you shoot any better injured shoulder.

20
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.070
The last of us, part two.

21
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.240
<v 0>This video was extremely painful to watch if she was shot in her shoulder</v>

23
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.630
and there was only a small amount penetrating through the backside of her

24
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.464
shoulder.

25
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.880
I would actually say to push the arrow through.

26
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

27
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.490
<v 0>Whenever you pull back out,</v>

28
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.290
the shape of the Broadhead is going to be more like a shark tooth.

29
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.120
So as you're coming out,

30
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.950
you're pulling all of that muscle and tendon that you've already, uh, damaged.

31
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.630
If I were in that scenario,

32
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:03.560
I'd probably try to find a tree and push myself against the tree to push the

33
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.150
arrow out that way.

34
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.320
I probably wouldn't shoot a bow just because of the range of motion that you

35
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:17.360
have to have to be able to draw a bow.

36
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.620
I think it would be extremely painful to lift your arm much less pullback.

37
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.800
Who knows? I might do some crazy stuff. I was shot in the shoulder.

38
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.070
So running and shooting the last of us.

39
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.940
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

40
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.720
<v 0>And we have a character who is loading the boat very quickly and making a shot</v>

41
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.800
extremely quickly.

42
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.050
The arrows probably aren't being actually knocked onto the bow on our

43
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:55.280
equipment. We have these plastic knocks that are at the end of the arrow,

44
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.620
that attached the actual arrow to the string so that when we draw back,

45
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:04.390
the arrow doesn't fall off As an Olympic Archer.

46
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.540
There's not really a need to load super quick.

47
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.520
It only takes me about 15 seconds after I've put an arrow on to

48
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.080
fully shoot my shot.

49
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.690
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

50
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.460
<v 0>Running and shooting at the same time is not necessarily</v>

51
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:24.330
recommended.

52
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.370
It would make it very difficult to range your target and then aim

53
00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:30.210
accurately.

54
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.080
It would have to be something that you practice all the time shooting through

55
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:35.850
water, stranded deep.

56
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.660
In this scenario, this guy is stranded.

57
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:45.690
So we have to give him a little bit of leeway there.

58
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.430
But one thing that would be very challenging to me would be

59
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.630
getting the shark out of the water. And whenever bow fishing happens,

60
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.790
there's a reel that you attached to your bow and there's a, um,

61
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.060
an attachment for it to go to the arrow. So when you shoot,

62
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.490
you have the string that trails after the arrow,

63
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.100
and then you can reel that in for the fish that you've shot

64
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.980
Water. Displacement is another thing to think about the fish may be here,

65
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.790
um, when you see it, but it's actually here under the water.

66
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.600
So you have to aim off of the fish to be able to shoot it.

67
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.680
Reaction time. Assassin's creed origins.

68
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.980
<v 0>I can honestly say that I have never jumped off a building and tried to shoot an</v>

70
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:39.240
arrow at the same time.

71
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.950
One thing that this person has to do is to look at number one,

72
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:48.420
how they're falling towards the ground. Number two,

73
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:52.170
how the wind is blowing. Number three,

74
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:56.310
if the person that you're shooting at is moving all of those

75
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.750
factors factor into his shot. This is realistic.

76
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:04.860
Not necessarily that it's realistic to jump off of a bridge and shoot somebody,

77
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.200
but in a way that you have to be aware of many different factors that affect

78
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:13.350
your shot. Next, let's take a look at arrows,

79
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.130
multiple arrows at once horizon zero Dawn.

80
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.870
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

81
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.550
<v 0>I actually have tried this. I have shot multiple arrows off of my bow.</v>

82
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.920
It feels extremely strange.

83
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.880
That string felt like it was going through molasses.

84
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.800
It was just so slow because it had to push more out of the way to get back to

85
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:41.220
its stock position or the guy's shooting three or four arrows.

86
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.190
Your arrows would not clump together like that on the bow.

87
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.590
Your arrows would go in multiple different directions.

88
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.260
If you think about the store to energy in a bow,

89
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.180
the more points that you add into it divides how much energy is going

90
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:55.980
into those arrows.

91
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.570
So whenever you multiple arrows onto the string,

92
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.370
all that energy is going into three different places versus it's intended

93
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.330
one place.

94
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.830
I don't think that it would be very helpful how arrows fly fi

95
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.250
We can see how the arrow is actually spinning towards the target.

96
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.350
And this is something that's very accurate.

97
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.140
That's a very small detail that a lot of people wouldn't necessarily pick up on.

98
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.430
I have one of my arrows here and I'm actually going to show you how it spins

99
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.370
fletching and feather are interchangeable.

100
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.400
So it's whatever stabilization you have on the back end of your arrow,

101
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.220
minor made of a plastic material.

102
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.640
So you have a lot of energy on this part of the arrow,

103
00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:45.310
because this is the point it's got some weight on it.

104
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:47.470
So it's taking the arrow towards the target,

105
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.930
but then the back end needs to be stabilized.

106
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.260
Otherwise there's going to be more oscillation left and right,

107
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.830
versus when you add that vein on there,

108
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.600
it's going to be able to spin which stabilizes the arrow as it's in flight,

109
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.970
Very accurate depiction here,

110
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.800
very accurate to what an arrow actually does in flight explosive

111
00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:14.110
arrows far cry four.

112
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.970
This is something that is exciting to think about as a scenario,

113
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.040
but just as not practical,

114
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.550
You're going to create a weaker shaft,

115
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.930
a weaker arrow, because there's a heavier fixed point on the end.

116
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.300
The energy is going into the back end of the arrow,

117
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:46.960
but not into the front end of the arrow. A lot of people would say, Oh, well,

118
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.420
if the arrow is too heavy, just pull it back further.

119
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.060
Because the further you pull the boat back, the heavier the bow gets,

120
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.360
you would potentially be putting your ear, your face,

121
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.940
your nose in the way of being hit by that string.

122
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.230
And I can tell you firsthand by hitting my arm several times over my career,

123
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.100
it is not a pleasant feeling, unlimited ammo crisis.

124
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.280
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

125
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.300
<v 0>Bo reloads arrows seemingly coming from nowhere.</v>

126
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.920
These arrows are just appearing and going into the bow and ready to shoot.

127
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.380
I wish that this was possible.

128
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:29.590
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

129
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.720
<v 0>That would make my life a little bit easier.</v>

130
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.550
We get our arrows in packages of dozens and they're separate components.

131
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.410
If one of the fledglings is bent or cut because it's been shot into the

132
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:44.110
target or somebody else hits it. If a knock breaks,

133
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.300
I want to be able to swap that out and have a good,

134
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:48.160
fresh arrow to be able to shoot.

135
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.210
I would imagine that there's a limit on how many arrows he can actually load

136
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:54.760
into his boat to be able to shoot multiple times.

137
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.480
I never seen a bow that reloads automatically,

138
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.460
but props to the sky for having one.

139
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.290
<v 1>Aero strange.</v>

140
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.850
<v 0>Rise of the tomb Raider.</v>

141
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.580
I would say that an arrow probably would not withstand that much of

142
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.443
a B.

143
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.433
<v 1>Bend.</v>

144
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.790
<v 0>Heroes do take on a lot of, uh, uh, beating whenever we shoot them.</v>

145
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.200
Our arrows are shooting anywhere from 200 to 300 feet per

146
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:31.034
second.

147
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.870
She would have to have more of the surface that she's shooting

148
00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:40.580
into in the middle of the arrow to even maybe make this work

149
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.040
just because I think the arrow would flex so far down, that it would snap,

150
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.960
especially depending on what kind of material her arrows are made out of ours

151
00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:55.700
are made out of a aluminum core with a carbon

152
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.280
fiber on the outside. So they're pretty strong,

153
00:09:58.281 --> 00:10:01.070
but I would not trust this with my life,

154
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.600
which is what Laura is doing in this video clip, deflecting arrows, the witch.

155
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.763
<v 1>Three.</v>

156
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.820
<v 0>An average, at least for my bow,</v>

157
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.150
we shoot about 50 pounds of draw weight.

158
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.160
And our arrows are moving about 200 feet per second or 136 miles per hour.

159
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.600
So if you're thinking about a very small projectile moving at you at

160
00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:31.130
136 miles per hour,

161
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:35.540
you have to have Ninja skills to be able to deflect an arrow or move out.

162
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.580
<v 1>That was some pretty bad acting, really unexplored other career options.</v>

163
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.770
<v 0>Let's see how bows are represented in video games sound the last of</v>

164
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:46.604
us,

165
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.630
The most that you're going to hear whenever an arrow is flying is like a

166
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.420
kind of sound. It's just, the fledglings are moving.

167
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.350
You're not going to hear that. So like it's not very loud.

168
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.213
<v 1>Not at all.</v>

169
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.080
<v 0>There's not actually a lot of sound that our equipment makes.</v>

170
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.340
It's not, um, going to have many metal pieces on it.

171
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:26.390
It's not going to have a lot of moving parts or anything like that.

172
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.920
The type of bow this guy is shooting is actually probably going to be one of the

173
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:34.310
quieter bows that's out there in real life,

174
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.920
carrying the bow tomb Raider.

175
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.220
<v 1>Got it. We have a fire look for the smoke. We're on our way.</v>

176
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:52.610
<v 0>In this video, you see Laura Croft carrying her bow across her back.</v>

177
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.130
This is my competition though. I shoot an Olympic recurve.

178
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.690
It's kind of a small space like between the string and my bow.

179
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.000
It's not a lot of space to get in there. One thing,

180
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:11.350
a lot of people don't realize is the makeup of our strings and the way they

181
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:12.520
actually work,

182
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.260
think of it as like strands of hair altogether.

183
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.700
So when they're pulled really tight, it's all one piece. But when they're shot,

184
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.110
it kind of flares out.

185
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.020
What are you doing here because of the wear and tear that you would see on that

186
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:32.590
string, it would be broken down pretty quickly.

187
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.330
Did you get that compound? Bow far cry five.

188
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.180
<v 2>If I die, I'm going out.</v>

189
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.230
<v 0>In this clip. Some of the parts of this bow are pretty realistic,</v>

190
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.570
especially the part of the draw.

191
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.340
There is a stability that you see in the bow.

192
00:12:56.341 --> 00:13:00.300
Once you draw back and that's something that's unique to a compound bow,

193
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.400
this is my hunting compound.

194
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.910
What you'll notice that's different from some of the other Bozel you've seen

195
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:07.830
today are these wheels on it.

196
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.530
And we call these cams and they have basically like a

197
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:17.760
police system in them. So whenever you draw the bow back,

198
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.560
there will be a break-over moment versus a long bow or a traditional

199
00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:25.800
bow where you can keep drawing, keep drawing,

200
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:28.410
keep drawing until pretty much the bow breaks.

201
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.140
The one thing that I would critique is the fact that there's not really a rest

202
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.150
or a place for that arrow to be sitting on.

203
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.490
Usually you would have a separate rest that you would attach to the bow for it

204
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:48.780
to hold the arrow up, versus it just sitting on the shelf of the bow.

205
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.320
The aiming device only has two pins.

206
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.590
They usually come with one pin, three pins or five

207
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.320
bow modifications. The last of us part two,

208
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.650
them calling it a range finder is incorrect.

209
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.650
I would just call this a site arranged finder.

210
00:14:13.651 --> 00:14:18.420
It has a system of lasers that determines a

211
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:21.720
distance between you and a particular target.

212
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:26.730
Whereas a site would be just a fixed item on the bow

213
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.900
that actually helps you aim at different distances.

214
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.190
I also have a problem with the way she strung the bow.

215
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.480
It was almost like she just pulled the string off of one end of the bow and just

216
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:49.314
took it off.

217
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.640
You have to actually put pressure onto the boat to get the limb to move

218
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.720
and flex, to get that string off because it's under tension.

219
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.180
And then whenever she strung the bow again,

220
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:06.980
she kind of just pulled the limb down and then put the string on which depending

221
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:11.090
on the weight of the bow is pretty impractical. You have to have like a 15,

222
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:14.030
20 pound bow to be able to do something like that,

223
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:15.920
maneuver for it to actually work.

224
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:26.200
The last piece of equipment that they put on this bow is a

225
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:26.710
grip.

226
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:31.690
They claim that this would help with decreasing weapons way to

227
00:15:31.691 --> 00:15:32.441
my knowledge,

228
00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:37.000
the only way to kind of change the way your bow

229
00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:40.090
moves or doesn't move would be to add stabilizers.

230
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:45.040
A grip is just to fit your hand. Cause everybody's hands are different.

231
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.200
When you look at my bow that I compete with,

232
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.740
I have these bars on my bow that hang off,

233
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.300
that help balance the boat.

234
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.043
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

235
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.020
<v 0>This will do. Let's talk about targets.</v>

236
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.990
Moving target far cry three.

237
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.260
The first thing that jumps out at me is just the delayed reaction of the

238
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:14.650
shot. You hear the shot hit, and then the guy goes,

239
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.980
and it's just like so delayed. It cracks me up.

240
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.120
Something that you would look at in this scenario would be the movement of the

241
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.160
truck, the movement of the people in the truck.

242
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:28.840
You also have to take into account the sunshine versus wind and direction and

243
00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:33.760
all of that stuff. Leading the target a little bit is very helpful.

244
00:16:33.761 --> 00:16:37.360
If we kind of are just mitigating variables,

245
00:16:37.361 --> 00:16:40.780
whenever we're shooting at, um, any type of target,

246
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.350
Cabela's big game Hunter pro hunts.

247
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.433
<v 2>Sloppy.</v>

248
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.750
<v 0>I actually would kind of disagree because the person is</v>

249
00:17:07.751 --> 00:17:11.680
shooting center mass, and then they're shooting lower than the sternum.

250
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.610
So the sternum is going to be a pretty solid bone to shoot against.

251
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.640
You. See on the end of the arrow has a broad head.

252
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.830
These blades don't move the razor sharp and pretty much stay that way.

253
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.130
But whenever you shoot, it stays open like that.

254
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.660
I think that's pretty accurate to what happens in real life. I was close,

255
00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:41.530
but still off the Mark, making an arrow, the forest.

256
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:46.000
<v 2>I'm going to quickly show you how to craft the bow in narrow in the forest,</v>

257
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.890
add the cloth, add the rope and add your stick.

258
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.830
<v 3>Crafted together. And you now have your boats.</v>

259
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.900
<v 0>Some of the bare bones of this is true. You do need a stick.</v>

260
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.980
You do need a rope or some sort of string. Granted,

261
00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:02.150
this is a video game,

262
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.590
but the sticky had had a lot of knots and burrs on it.

263
00:18:06.591 --> 00:18:10.640
And it also had quite a few V's off for like twigs and stuff like that.

264
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.720
And you now have your bow. I would try to find all one contiguous piece.

265
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.350
<v 3>You need some cloth and just crack open pretty much any suitcase.</v>

266
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.110
<v 0>I don't think that you need cloth to be able to make a bow.</v>

267
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.550
<v 3>Take your arrows.</v>

268
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:25.040
You're gonna need some feathers which are right up there in your backpack.

269
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:28.310
So you add them to your craft thing and get the stick.

270
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.070
And you can now craft your arrows.

271
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.850
<v 0>As far as the execution or the making of the arrows.</v>

272
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.990
I would say trying to find straighter, uh, sticks,

273
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.280
and then kind of whittling those down into straight cylinders

274
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:48.230
versus something that's a little bit more crooked and all of that's just for

275
00:18:48.231 --> 00:18:51.340
accuracy, hidden target. We split.

276
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.513
<v 1>Resort.</v>

277
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.560
<v 0>I've actually shot some fruit before it makes your arrows very sticky and it's</v>

278
00:19:03.561 --> 00:19:07.280
not fun to clean up. It's not going to stick out like this one.

279
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.050
It's going to go straight through that watermelon.

280
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.880
I would recommend not shooting anything that you can't comfortably aim on

281
00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:18.290
or C plus. Why would you want to shoot a watermelon when you can shoot a target?

282
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:25.910
I've had several people ask me to shoot an Apple off of their head,

283
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.310
even strangers like in the airport,

284
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.760
even though I'm very confident in the way I shoot, I still would.

285
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.870
I just wouldn't take that risk. There wouldn't be enough fun involved.

286
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.640
There would just be a whole lot of fear.

287
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.290
<v 1>Unbelievable.</v>

288
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.030
<v 0>I think it's very interesting to see all parts of archery and how it's</v>

289
00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:52.820
shown in different, uh, mediums.

290
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.540
A couple of the videos had really good Aeroflight in them.

291
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.570
Attention to detail was really there.

292
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.770
I really enjoyed my experience today and hopefully helped you learn a little bit

293
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.850
about my sport.
