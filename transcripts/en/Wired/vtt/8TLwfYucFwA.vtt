00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>This is wired auto complete answer.</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.050
<v 1>And why can't we do this? We had that problem.</v>

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.240
<v 2>Hey, I'm Tim Heidecker and I'm John C. Riley.</v>

4
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.490
<v 1>Is the wired autocomplete interview who? John C. Riley,</v>

5
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.070
who is John C. Ryan.

6
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.070
<v 0>Starting off with an easy question. I am John C. Riley.</v>

7
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.450
<v 1>This is LSD. Next question.</v>

8
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.070
Who's saying John C. Riley E in Wockhardt.

9
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.840
<v 0>Who sang? I mean like who sang for me? How dare you ask me that question?</v>

10
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.200
I sang all of my sing own singing in that movie.

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.400
And in every movie I've ever appeared in a singing has always been me.

12
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.410
Although the birds had a great song called John Riley and they sang that song.

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.830
That's must've been what they were the old folk song called John Riley.

14
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.443
I recommend it.

15
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.100
<v 1>Is John C. Riley in guardians of the galaxy.</v>

16
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.310
<v 0>Let's see, I play a corpsman day.</v>

17
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.320
Who is part of the Nova Corps, the kind of intergalactic police force.

18
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.330
<v 1>There's no question marks in any of these.</v>

19
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.290
Very hard to say these correctly does.

20
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.030
John says John C. Riley.

21
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.330
<v 0>Very few people.</v>

22
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.670
I look a lot like my brothers and sisters, that's weird. And my father,

23
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.790
my late father, that was one of the things coming up as an actor.

24
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:34.910
Like I was looking for an example. I like,

25
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.810
how could I be an actor who is like me? And there was no,

26
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.980
there was nobody like me, which I thought was a, was a problem.

27
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:46.760
But then someone explained to me that's good because then you'll be unique.

28
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.940
But the only thing I could ever relate to as a kid was like,

29
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.200
kind of Micky Dolenz kind of Elliot Gould.

30
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.540
Like they had curly hair, like that was about it.

31
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.180
<v 1>And all the hardware Hardy, you think,</v>

32
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.570
I look like all you did when you did all that, when you did the movie, was that.

33
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.670
<v 0>It was makeup. Yeah. Although the first, my first meeting with that director,</v>

34
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.890
I said, what are you thinking about this for? I just lost a bunch of weight.

35
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:12.110
What are you thinking about for this thing? He's like, well,

36
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:14.660
would you want to wear a suit? And I was like, yeah,

37
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.850
I'm not getting 120 pounds now. It's your turn to be on the hot seat, Tim.

38
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.040
We've got dark to close my eyes. No is Tim.

39
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:29.030
Heidecker really glued them on tight. Real. I think I can answer this question.

40
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.463
He's very real.

41
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.300
<v 1>I'm the real deal, but I do play fake characters named Tim. Hi Decker.</v>

42
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:38.520
So there's confusion there. Good point. And I,

43
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.560
I do need to think about changing my name. I'm going to legally change my name.

44
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.360
I've decided Tim Jones.

45
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.240
<v 0>Is Tim. Heidecker funny. I personally think Tim is one of the funnest.</v>

46
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.673
Oh yes. Sorry.

47
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.760
<v 1>People don't think I'm funny and that's fine because there's a lot of people I</v>

48
00:02:55.761 --> 00:03:00.040
don't think are funny and it's relative. I make myself laugh. I probably,

49
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.270
uh, at myself more than other people do, but you seem to think I'm funny.

50
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.470
And I have funny friends.

51
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.840
<v 0>Funny, but looks aren't. Everything is Tim Heidecker really.</v>

52
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.760
<v 1>Right. Running.</v>

53
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.180
<v 0>For district. Attorney.</v>

54
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.340
<v 1>Character is named Tim Heidecker.</v>

55
00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:20.760
He ran for district attorney and lost a couple of years ago.

56
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.070
<v 0>Against Rosati. The rat, the rat Vincent Rosati is Tim Honaker.</v>

57
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.040
<v 1>Married. Sorry.</v>

58
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.480
<v 0>Interesting. I just had lunch with Tim and his wife. Sorry ladies. It's Tim. Hi,</v>

59
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.150
Decker. Me married to.

60
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 1>Nice. Married to Eric. We obviously Jan,</v>

61
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.940
Skyler and Wayne Schuyler are married.

62
00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:45.270
The only married news team in the Tri-County area.

63
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.900
Eric's probably the man I've kissed the most. We are in a way,

64
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:52.620
married in a sort of legal sense. You know, we, the, your company,

65
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.420
the company exists. It's a legal partnership. Oh,

66
00:03:57.421 --> 00:03:59.820
here comes. Rob Riley was round two.

67
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.440
<v 0>Man. There's a full box of questions, folks, if you're bored now, just,</v>

68
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.250
this is a lot more coming in. Hear a voiceover of letters that you've written.

69
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.060
What? Dear mother, the winter is coming strong.

70
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.430
I'm still doing the wired autocomplete interview. What is.

71
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.290
<v 1>The John C. Riley GIF. GIF.</v>

72
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.393
I mean, there's like.

73
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.480
<v 0>Oh, you know, Phil Johnson tried to tell me that it's called jifs okay.</v>

74
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.690
They're not shifts. Okay. They're gifts. Phil.

75
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.250
Just take this moment to tell Phil that probably the most famous gifts of me on

76
00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:39.690
the internet are ones that are actually of someone else. Dr. Steve Brule.

77
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.690
I look a lot like him.

78
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.080
So I guess you could say that's a gift of me.

79
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:49.320
I want to say Jeff after lecturing, Phil, about how it's a gift.

80
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.640
<v 1>Well, I use it all the time to communicate those gifts.</v>

81
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.100
Jeff's Oh, okay. What is John

82
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.630
[inaudible] like in real life that's should be a secret.

83
00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:02.100
I don't know if you need to get into that. Yeah.

84
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.180
<v 0>I like, it's such a general question. I'm all right. You know,</v>

85
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.650
I was just a human being. I have my interests, not perfect. Try to be healthy.

86
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:14.010
Try to have a lot of empathy. I'm not putting on some character right now.

87
00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:15.150
This is what I'm like.

88
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.840
<v 1>What is John C Reilly's eye color. Do you know?</v>

89
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.640
<v 0>Ah, I should have looked. This is an easy one. I should get this.</v>

90
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.740
I was just in the bathroom and the mirror. Um, my eyes are blue.

91
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:32.040
Come on. What is John C. Reilly band? Well,

92
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.700
my first band was called shark fighter.

93
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.790
Me and my brother had a band called shark fighter.

94
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.680
And then I had a band called frozen spit in my twenties.

95
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.140
And then I had a band called stereo blues,

96
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:48.090
which is a blues band where I played the harmonica.

97
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.930
And now my current band is called John Riley and friends. Very easy to remember.

98
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.740
I also call myself John Riley and friends in the band because it's the one place

99
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:57.900
I don't have to put the, but dang,

100
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.700
see I'm required by sag to make my name. John C.

101
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.860
Reilly because there used to be another John Riley in the union.

102
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.600
<v 1>I always thought it was Chauncey Riley. Your name was Chauncey Riley.</v>

103
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.350
<v 0>By secret pseudonym. Okay, Tim,</v>

104
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.880
why was Tim and Eric canceled? We canceled.

105
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.160
<v 1>Well, we said a lot of nasty things.</v>

106
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.820
<v 0>You weren't canceled. He walked away.</v>

107
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.300
<v 1>No, we, we, uh, we walked away to do a movie that was very unsuccessful.</v>

108
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.240
<v 0>Why is Tim and Eric funny?</v>

109
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.790
<v 1>Yeah. W I, you know, again, relative terms,</v>

110
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.980
I don't appreciate the grammar full of controversy or Tim and Eric.

111
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.480
So weird. We love weirdness. We love weird new out.

112
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.850
We love being weird and random.

113
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.120
I'm working on new characters because he's real. My name is my name is John.

114
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.190
<v 0>All right. He's weird. Cause the world is weird.</v>

115
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:57.100
And if you react to it in an honest way, you are weird.

116
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.280
<v 1>Why is John internet? Why is John C. Riley? An actor?</v>

117
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.690
<v 0>I'm an actor because I love to tell a story.</v>

118
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.590
It's because people started to pay me to do it and it became my life.

119
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.600
I didn't really set out to be an it.

120
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.600
<v 1>Why is John C. Reilly on Timmins?</v>

121
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.130
<v 0>I'm not on Tim and Eric.</v>

122
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.520
I'm an executive producer on check it out with Dr. Steve Brule.

123
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.740
You handle a lot of the finances and just finances.

124
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:23.320
I do a lot of the scheduling and budgeting.

125
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.570
<v 1>Why, why John C. Riley, voice actor. Why John C. Riley, a voice actor. Why not?</v>

126
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.380
<v 0>Uh, because, uh, it's fun to be a voice actor. You can wear whatever you want.</v>

127
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.020
No one puts makeup on your face or anything weird like that.

128
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:38.230
You just go in and goof around. And then if you make a mistake,

129
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:39.160
you just do it again.

130
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.040
There's never any pressure when you're doing voiceover work. It's just like,

131
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:43.010
yeah, we got time.

132
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.660
<v 1>Unique and distinctive on the eyes for us. But also on the ears.</v>

133
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:48.130
You've got a very, you got your own.

134
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.300
<v 0>Which I have discovered during the pandemic times I wear a full mask,</v>

135
00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:55.870
sunglasses, hat, whatever people are like, love your work.

136
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.310
And hear me say one thing, like, you know, I have a order of fries. I was like,

137
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.290
Holy. I love your work. Like wow, can Tim Heidecker cook? I can cook.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.030
<v 0>Yeah. Tim actually released a great record called for fear of death.</v>

141
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.300
Fear of death. Continue. Heidecker act well,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.480
tune in to moon base eight on November 8th.

143

And you'll see him act his off with me and Fred Armisen. Ken,

144
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:29.560
Tim Heidecker stand up. Let's see.

145
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.860
Come on. You can do better than that. Yeah, he can stand up. In fact,

146
00:08:35.861 --> 00:08:39.640
he has a standup special coming out. That's right. What's that called? Uh,

147
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.800
an evening with Tim hider and eating too hot.

148
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.930
<v 1>How,</v>

149
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.710
how to contact John C. Riley?

150
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.740
<v 0>Let me just use this opportunity to tell everyone out there.</v>

151
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.530
I am not on social media in any way.

152
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.950
So if you see someone says John C.

153
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.390
Riley official or verified or whatever the hell, it ain't me, folks and Amy,

154
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.840
I don't have enough time to do the things I like to do in my life.

155
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:05.970
Let alone things like social media.

156
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.850
<v 1>How tall is John C. Riley? What would possibly be in feet?</v>

157
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.100
<v 0>62, but I used to say six one and a half.</v>

158
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.070
So it sounded like I wasn't too tall on my resume.

159
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.900
<v 1>How old was John C. Riley in Gilbert.</v>

160
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.450
Grape. Oh, Gilbert and Gilbert grapes.

161
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.180
<v 0>How, what was my age? Let's see.</v>

162
00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:29.900
That movie was made in 1992,

163
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.270
I believe. And I was born in 65, 75, 85.

164
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.760
Uh, this is where I lose my math. I was 20, 28.

165
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.010
<v 1>How did John Sierra? This is a good quote.</v>

166
00:09:43.011 --> 00:09:45.020
I don't think I know the answer to this. How did John C.

167
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.960
Reilly and will Ferrell meet?

168
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.420
<v 0>We met through Molly. Shannon. I was friends with Molly.</v>

169
00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:52.520
I'd done a movie with her called never been kissed.

170
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.980
And I was in New York and I think I had brunch with Molly and she's

171
00:09:57.981 --> 00:10:01.640
like, you should meet my friend. You, you guys would really get along.

172
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.830
You would love him will came and met us on the West side highway in Manhattan,

173
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.740
where we were walking to Molly's apartment. And I looked at will.

174
00:10:09.741 --> 00:10:13.790
And I was like, Oh my God, she's right. I totally like this guy, like.

175
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.190
<v 1>Soul connection. Let's see on SNL.</v>

176
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.440
<v 0>He's on us. I know with her at the time,</v>

177
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.570
but I just didn't really know it was early days.

178
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.710
I almost did feel related to him in some weird way. Tim,

179
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.290
what is Tim Heidecker height nine. What is your Zodiac?

180
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.070
<v 3>What is [inaudible] versus.</v>

181
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.080
<v 1>What does Tim Heidecker versus California? What does that mean? Oh,</v>

182
00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:41.300
well that was the trial probably when, uh,

183
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.850
probably the official name was the reference to another.

184
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.630
<v 0>On cinema. Tim portrayed himself.</v>

185
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.990
<v 1>What are Tim Heidecker kitchen tips is one of my favorite.</v>

186
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.640
<v 0>Shows that Tim's ever done. Tim's kitchen tips, very sauce, heavy kitchen.</v>

187
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.000
<v 1>It was, you know, on Facebook a few years ago,</v>

188
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:02.210
there was all those videos where it was just those, the ukulele playing.

189
00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:06.650
And it was everyone just mixing things and making everything look so

190
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:09.110
easy. And now you do it, then there's this and there's this.

191
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:12.800
And then it's like this compounded on top of each other. And I just said, well,

192
00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:14.750
why don't we do that? Just making Russian dressing,

193
00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:18.590
which is just two ingredients, but then it's about five minutes of stirring.

194
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.640
<v 0>It really is amazing. Check out Tim's kitchen tips.</v>

195
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.850
What is Tim Heidegger's office hours?

196
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.400
<v 1>Nah, 10:00 AM on Thursdays, uh,</v>

197
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:31.460
on the YouTube channel of Tim Heidegger's YouTube channel and it's,

198
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.410
it's sort of my Larry King live.

199
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.030
<v 0>Yeah, it was like Tim,</v>

200
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.510
you decided to just like reach out to the fans directly and really just.

201
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.840
<v 1>And he just started calling in early on and you would call in because you were</v>

202
00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:42.471
just sitting at home,

203
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:46.850
having breakfast and you'd call in and go on and on about your Asya bowls that

204
00:11:46.851 --> 00:11:50.450
you're eating. And the joke was I would go, okay, thank you.

205
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.010
<v 0>Yeah, color. Yeah. I want it to support you now at it. It's become this.</v>

206
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.110
<v 1>Huge thing. It's the number one podcast in the world.</v>

207
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.040
<v 0>My final thoughts on what the internet wants to know about me is like maybe the</v>

208
00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:04.470
internet should be a little more creative. Like these,

209
00:12:04.471 --> 00:12:07.320
these are the things that are very easily answered. For the most part.

210
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.520
<v 1>I would be Googling more things like, you know, how can I find meaning,</v>

211
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.510
uh, how do I, how can I help my community?

212
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.250
How can I learn to be more empathetic and, and more, don't worry about people.

213
00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:23.040
I guess. We're we, we w we're not very introduced.

214
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.031
<v 0>Fine. You know,</v>

215
00:12:24.031 --> 00:12:27.390
one thing I would like to ask the Internet's help with whatever questions you

216
00:12:27.391 --> 00:12:31.320
ask about me. Just Google my name as many times as you can,

217
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:35.250
because I'm going to hot competition with John C.

218
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.100
Calhoun president and John C McGinley.

219
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.100
<v 1>Autocomplete. It's John C and then yeah.</v>

220
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.000
<v 0>Yeah. W Calhoun no, no, no, no. You want to John C. Riley.</v>

221
00:12:45.001 --> 00:12:49.110
So everyone just pumped my name in there as many times as you can flush

222
00:12:49.111 --> 00:12:51.600
Calhoun's Calhoun was not a great president. Yeah.

223
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.740
<v 1>He's not a president. Yeah. He was. There's no way. He was a president,</v>

224
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.410
which we had the answer to reveal. Um,

225
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.190
so I can name all the presidents and he's not wanting to, yeah,

226
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.600
I'm going to guess. He was just saying.

227
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.040
<v 0>Senator John C and look, my name comes up first.</v>

228
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:09.900
John C.

229
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.340
Calhoun is vice president of the United States.

230
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.080
He was a heartbeat away from the president right or wrong. He was beat away.

231
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.470
He wasn't a Senator. All right. So folks, help me out.

232
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.990
Get this Calhoun bomb off my search engine.
