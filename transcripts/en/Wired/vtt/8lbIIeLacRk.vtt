00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>This one says what 2020 has Pata.</v>

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.290
<v 1>That not everyone should make sourdough.</v>

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.020
<v 0>Hi, I'm Natasha Lucero.</v>

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.790
<v 1>I'm Rachel Brosnahan.</v>

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.380
And we're here with wired to answer the most Googled questions about 2020.

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.690
<v 0>I'm scared. Okay. Let's do this.</v>

7
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.880
<v 1>The 2020 world series count. Is that basketball?</v>

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.013
Yes.

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.600
<v 0>Then it should count hashtag sports,</v>

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.150
which 2020 NFL teams are undefeated. You know,

11
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:42.740
what's interesting is NFL stands for not for Lazaro.

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.770
<v 1>Giants. That was my high school. Mascot.</v>

13
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.181
<v 0>Is 20,</v>

14
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:51.920
20 a LA Nina year without a hurricane or a sports team.

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.150
I don't know. Let's go with yes. Yes, definitely.

16
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.100
Our 2020 election results. Final. Yes. Yes.

17
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.450
That guy lost.

18
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.220
We don't have to have his voice echoing through our homes anymore.

19
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.410
How 2020 changed the world? I'm all.

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.660
<v 1>For keeping the personal bubble. Post.</v>

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.410
<v 0>2020.</v>

22
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.090
I personally love telling people to back the away from me.

23
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:21.800
Like whenever they come close.

24
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.900
<v 1>You can't cancel digital plans. It's so much harder to cancel virtual.</v>

25
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.430
You can't cancel cocktail hour. Cause everyone's like, what the are you doing?

26
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:32.600
You're just in your house.

27
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.890
<v 0>And virtual plans are like 50% worse than real plans.</v>

28
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.110
Only 50, 70.

29
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.490
<v 1>77.</v>

30
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.510
Where 2020 Superbowl the Tasha where?

31
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.620
<v 0>Well, let me take a guess.</v>

32
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:49.480
And I'm just going to guess a place that I would like to go, um, Montenegro.

33
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.570
<v 1>Okay. Yeah. Take me to the Superbowl baby.</v>

34
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.760
<v 0>Okay. How 20, 20 M L B playoffs work.</v>

35
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't even know what this is. I'm not even like trying to be funny,

36
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.740
like M L B. Do you have any idea? I do.

37
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.240
<v 1>I actually know major league baseball. This is baseball. That one.</v>

38
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:11.450
I know they work, um, in a bubble,

39
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.510
everyone doesn't get to slap each other on the this year,

40
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.630
no slapping in this year's playoff.

41
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.330
<v 0>Will 2020 go down in history. Interesting. People are Googling that.</v>

42
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.800
<v 1>We'll go down somewhere.</v>

43
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.790
Next question has 2020 had the most hurricanes.

44
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.230
Yeah. Yeah. Inside and outside of the home.

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.790
<v 0>It has felt like hurricane season for about a year is 20,</v>

46
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:50.060
20 a leap year. Um, Hmm.

47
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.010
If you mean leap off of a cliff into a fire pit of

48
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:59.890
hell, then yes. I would say it's a good leap. Here is 20,

49
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.680
20 the year of the rat.

50
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.670
<v 1>I mean, it's kind of a year of Rudy Giuliani. So.</v>

51
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.900
<v 0>Is that his nickname? That's a perfect nickname for him.</v>

52
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.200
<v 1>2020 Pennies worth anything.</v>

53
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.530
A 1 cent is my understanding.

54
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.270
<v 0>Did 2020 via amaze have an audience. Now I actually know what that is.</v>

55
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:25.830
And I do know that their audience was a bunch of beautiful gen Z

56
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:29.610
cutouts. Ah, smart. I mean, I don't know. I'm just guessing.

57
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.010
<v 1>Does 2020 have 53 weeks.</v>

58
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.380
I feel like 2020 has 103 weeks.

59
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.810
<v 0>Yeah. It feels like it's been like 6,000 days has 20,</v>

60
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:46.230
20 been the worst year in history. You know.

61
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.850
<v 1>This one's interesting. There have been some pretty gnarly years.</v>

62
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.600
It's not a great year in history.

63
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.610
<v 0>I would say 2017 when my comedy central show another period was canceled was</v>

64
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.350
definitely worse. So no.

65
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.480
Who is 2020 world series MVP.

66
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.050
Natasha Ligero no, I thought Claire, uh,

67
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.200
performance was very understated, but uh,

68
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.980
Olivia Coleman was the winner did 20,

69
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:20.790
20 start a new decade. I feel like.

70
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.930
<v 1>This is a trick question that would be on, are you smarter than a fifth grader?</v>

71
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.700
And we would not be.

72
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.090
<v 0>I went to public school, so I'm not really sure,</v>

73
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:33.390
but it does feel that it started a new decade. Yeah.

74
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.320
The 2020 skip Easter. Uh,

75
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.920
I converted to Judaism just so I don't have to answer stuff like this.

76
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.110
<v 1>I'm going to go with yes.</v>

77
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.490
Although I did see the Easter bunny in times square. So maybe not.

78
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.240
<v 0>Who is 2020 M B a M V</v>

79
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.100
P uh, AOC where.

80
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.780
<v 1>2020 World series played, um,</v>

81
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.340
in our living rooms. No.

82
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.590
<v 0>Yes. Good answer. Thank you. How many days in 2020,</v>

83
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:14.430
I actually know this one. It's 600,050.

84
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.320
<v 1>2020. Have the highest voter turnout.</v>

85
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.810
Yes. Thank you. Young people. Thank you, black women.

86
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.850
Thank you. Activists on the ground who got people out to vote? Yes.

87
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.180
<v 0>Can 2020 be over already so.</v>

88
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.490
<v 1>Soon. So, so soon.</v>

89
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.660
<v 0>Sounds like a 14 year old type this in what best meme of</v>

90
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:40.680
2020.

91
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.390
<v 1>I loved the fly.</v>

92
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.290
The internet was that it's prime with Mike Pence's fly.

93
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.300
God sent that fly to Mike Penn.

94
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.600
<v 0>2020. Would you rather.</v>

95
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.970
<v 1>Would you rather lick a seat on the</v>

96
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.040
subway or touch an elevator button in time.

97
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.810
<v 0>Square? Oh, I would definitely touch an elevator button really.</v>

98
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.120
<v 1>I dunno. I feel like they cleaned the subway a lot,</v>

99
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.660
which 2020 Corvette is the fastest.

100
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.850
Who's buying a Corvette in 2028.

101
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.500
<v 0>My husband bought like a Nightrider Corvette from the eighties. Um,</v>

102
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.540
and he had it parked in our garage for about eight months and then I

103
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:26.500
made him sell it. So not yours, not your Corvette did 20,

104
00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:29.320
20 AP exams matter.

105
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.360
<v 1>I don't think they should have to matter this year.</v>

106
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.410
How do you learn AP stuff on zoom?

107
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.960
Cancel AP exams 2020.

108
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.221
<v 0>It was 2020.</v>

109
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:43.780
The hottest year on record fire season was I think the worst on record.

110
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.140
So I don't know if that also translates into the hottest year on record,

111
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:51.490
but I would assume so because fire equals hot hottest in the bedroom.

112
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.490
Rachel, um, has the pandemic made you pretty horny?

113
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.320
<v 1>Listen to Dasha. That is, uh, uh.</v>

114
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.310
<v 0>What's 2020 mentioned in back to the future. Good question.</v>

115
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:04.510
I'm going to say yes. Yes.

116
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.500
<v 1>I need 20. Should I buy a house? If you can, will.</v>

117
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.780
<v 0>2020 Be a cold winter. Oh.</v>

118
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.450
<v 1>I hope not. That's just me at the end of this year.</v>

119
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.640
<v 0>Moved to LA. It's nice here. It's always 75. And then when the, um, fire start,</v>

120
00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:23.470
I actually don't know how to help you should 2020 be declared a zero

121
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:24.970
year. Yes.

122
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.100
<v 1>Yes it should. What? 2020 looks.</v>

123
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.250
<v 0>It looks like an old bar. Hag. Who's been, you know,</v>

124
00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:38.080
he's at the bar at like four 30 and she just fell off of her chair

125
00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:41.950
with a lit cigarette. And people are just like walking on top of her.

126
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.310
And it's just a mess. Was 20, 20 a recession.

127
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.320
Not only was there a recession,

128
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:51.730
there was also a little thing we like to call a pandemic. A global pandemic.

129
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.580
<v 1>2020 Was out here doing all the things.</v>

130
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.360
<v 0>When 2020 taxes due April 15th dogs.</v>

131
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.850
I say dog now does.

132
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.880
<v 1>The 20, 20 Rav four episode.</v>

133
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.810
I live in New York. I wouldn't.

134
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.680
<v 0>No, my dad actually bought one of these and yes, that's one of the appeals.</v>

135
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:15.820
Like it's like a Jeep that has like the top off, but he lives in Florida.

136
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:16.750
So how.

137
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.280
<v 1>2020 Started.</v>

138
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.003
<v 2>How it ended?</v>

139
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.280
<v 0>Well, 20, 20 coins be worth more. Listen, we're becoming digital.</v>

140
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:38.830
We're all going to get chipped. There's not going to be coins soon.

141
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.200
No coins are really worth anything.

142
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.290
<v 1>Let's save them just in case. Cause it could be like beanie babies.</v>

143
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.660
<v 0>Thank you guys so much for watching. I hope this was inspiring. I feel like, um,</v>

144
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.350
once we got through all the sports questions, um,

145
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.380
Rachel and I were really able to help you guys out.

146
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.630
<v 1>I feel like we had a lot to offer.</v>
