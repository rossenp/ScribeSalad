00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.110
<v 0>Greetings earthlings.</v>

2
00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:05.910
My name is Questlove and this is my wired autocomplete interview.

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.380
<v 1>Aye.</v>

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.800
<v 0>I am definitely afraid to Google myself.</v>

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.100
Even if I have to look for something I will type Questlove.

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.150
Cause I don't want to see.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.780
<v 1>So me.</v>

8
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.610
<v 0>Doing this as face of my biggest fear.</v>

9
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.220
<v 1>What quest love.</v>

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.750
<v 0>That's a good one. What is inquest loves hair? This is a good question.</v>

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.410
I'm known for my humongous Afro.

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.060
I come from a family of chia pets. The more you try to cut my hair,

13
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:42.350
the more that it grows,

14
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.880
I think that people want to know is the object that normally is in my hair,

15
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.480
which is the Afro pink. I keep it there because, uh,

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.100
my scalp often itches. One time my Afro got me in trouble is, uh,

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.300
I went to the strip club in Atlanta. First time they made it rain.

18
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.340
$80 fell right in the hair between the CR the crest

19
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:08.180
of my Afro pick and my Afro.

20
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.050
And the second I went to take it to, to give,

21
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:16.880
to like the nearest person, like security was on me in like three seconds.

22
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:20.300
Like we got that. We got that. Even on my body. I couldn't touch it.

23
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.460
What does cost loves real name?

24
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.930
My real name is a mirror colleague

25
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.370
Thompson.

26
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.270
If I know a person of Arabic descent is asking me what my full name is,

27
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:35.090
I will say a mere Holly Thompson.

28
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.110
I got my hero Prince.

29
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.190
He cold called me at a studio once. So I pick up the phone. He's like,

30
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.150
hello Prince. I was like, wait, is this you?

31
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.150
And this is back when we didn't know if we were allowed to still call him his

32
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.280
name or not inside secret. He he's,

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.460
he's still at black people call him Prince because we weren't going to try and

34
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:59.960
pronounce that symbol. He's like, I'm calling you Prince because you know,

35
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:03.410
that's what your name means. Right? And then, uh, I'll say four years later,

36
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:04.970
when I was at a concert,

37
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.040
he was singing the song sign of the times and there's a really famous line.

38
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.120
Uh, fall in love. Get married, have a baby. We'll call him Nate. If it's a boy,

39
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.300
he knew I was on a blind date. He changed the lyrics to fall in love,

40
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.930
get married, have a baby. We'll name him a mirror if he's funky.

41
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.620
And he kind of looked at me and like I knew my date was room for light.

42
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.160
That's right. France. The example,

43
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.690
what drums does Questlove play a love week? Uh,

44
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.490
I started off on a lovely accent.

45
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:39.380
My very first real drum set at the age of eight for the beginning part of

46
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:43.460
my career. I went with Yamaha because that was like the biggest name.

47
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.510
But I learned early in life that sometimes like the biggest name and the most

48
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:52.250
popular name doesn't suit you. Well, I like a really trashy,

49
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.210
dirty sound to my drums.

50
00:02:55.211 --> 00:03:00.190
So oftentimes like drum makers will go for these long drawn out stories

51
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:00.700
of like,

52
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.650
they went to a particular forest in Japan to chop down this

53
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.200
particular type of tree. That's like real expensive.

54
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:12.610
Like this drum is worth $90,000. We use this particular type of wood and dah,

55
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.250
dah, dah, dah, dah, I'll go along like, Oh, that's really interesting,

56
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.510
but I'd never play that stuff.

57
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:21.400
So like I have about 70 drum sets right now and which I

58
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.720
never touch because I want the cheap high school version.

59
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:28.030
Like I want, I want their lowest,

60
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.470
most accessible drum like that to me is the sound of America's

61
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.210
garage. And I like that.

62
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.990
What type of headphones does Questlove use? Okay.

63
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.770
So really it depends when I'm deejaying,

64
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.960
depending on what my hair situation is,

65
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:47.230
you need a sort of adorable set of headphones.

66
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.410
Cause I'm known to break them if they like stretch out too much or whatever.

67
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:54.700
So audio technicals, M 50 X that's the specific brand that I use.

68
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.720
They're high quality. However, when I'm on stage,

69
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.310
I use a custom in-ear mix by the one and only Jerry Harvey audio.

70
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.610
They are the best in ear monitors ever.

71
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.650
My favorite part of getting into your microphone,

72
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:12.940
customs is you have to get the phone, uh, put in your ear.

73
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.010
So it's like a weird feeling.

74
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.630
It's like taking pancake batter and someone just like squeezing it and your ear.

75
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:22.960
And then it, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm weird. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.320
Where does Questlove live? I'm a rolling stone.

77
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.570
I was born in Philadelphia.

78
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.590
I still have property in Philadelphia ever since the tonight show I've

79
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.690
relocated to Manhattan and the dawning of a COVID 19 and

80
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:40.540
quarantining. I've done something I never thought I'd do before.

81
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.270
I used to make fun of everyone. Every professional,

82
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:47.980
every author and actor and director, I knew that got that place, uh,

83
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.940
in upstate New York. And now I've become that person. It's not a farm.

84
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:55.660
It's not a ranch. I think my girlfriend likes to call it a Chateau.

85
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.020
It's an artist community. When I drive, drive up at,

86
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:01.870
I feel like I'm in the beginning of a Pee-wee's Playhouse.

87
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.760
Like it's like a fantasy land thing.

88
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:08.320
It's kind of cool where to buy the Questlove cheese steak. Good question.

89
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.850
At most live nation venues. And uh, my hometown of Philadelphia,

90
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.480
Philadelphia Phillies, my cheese steak is made of a impossible meat.

91
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.280
I'm not a vegan. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do want to eat a way better.

92
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:22.930
So this would have came out way earlier,

93
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:26.950
but I had to strike a deal with Amoruso to make the rules,

94
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.900
because if it's now on an animal or a soup bread,

95
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.510
it's not a cheese steak from Philly. I don't care what anyone says.

96
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:35.110
You can't put it on our bag. Okay. Be Questlove Supreme podcast.

97
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.860
I taught at NYU for about six years.

98
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.360
It was just 25 students.

99
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.620
A lot of my students are actually notable people right now in the industry.

100
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.750
You guys know Maggie Rogers use one of my students one day. Uh,

101
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.400
my manager told me like, well,

102
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.810
instead of spewing this knowledge that you have just 25 kids a year,

103
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.800
why don't you make it national? So Questlove Supreme is, uh,

104
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.950
my podcast with my friends and we just,

105
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:07.970
we just talk music and pop culture. And it's not just music. It's acting,

106
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:11.060
it's film. It's, it's everything, pop culture, politics and everything.

107
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:15.530
So you can hear it from practically anywhere where you get podcasts.

108
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.580
Okay. What high hats does Questlove use full disclosure? Again,

109
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.150
I like there's a very specific trashy, dirty,

110
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.800
unprofessional sound.

111
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:29.510
I like kind of like taking brand new jeans and really destroying them so that

112
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.560
they used a mourn. That's what I do with my drums.

113
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:37.730
And with my symbols, I will just get very, very old Zildjian cymbals.

114
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.560
There's a guy in Chicago named Sonny Burman and he does these custom

115
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.310
he'll take the symbols. He'll destroy them. He'll cut holes in them.

116
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.210
They'll just make them sound like trash cans. And oftentimes, uh,

117
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.170
I will use that, but the company I endorse Zildjian they have, uh,

118
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.120
a brand called, uh, FX stack, which is the same thing. They, uh,

119
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.630
poke holes in the, in the symbols to give it more bite,

120
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.680
more edge to it. So those, those are the symbols that I use.

121
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.030
What is Questlove's of vinyl collection? When I was five years old,

122
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.210
a complete stranger asked me what type of music I like.

123
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:17.480
And she brought me my first three records in a record player.

124
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.040
I found the note that she wrote to my parents. Like I love Amir. He's so cute.

125
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.520
I want to buy him records. And she wrote it on a cocktail napkin.

126
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.590
And I found that note like two weeks ago and I put it on my Instagram and I

127
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:34.010
wanted to find this woman, her name was Ellie. She lived in Portland, Maine.

128
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.150
They just found her.

129
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:39.560
So I guess I get a chance to think her because now I own 200,000 records.

130
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.360
She planted a seed that sort of grew out of

131
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:47.960
control. And now I need to buy houses just to step my records.

132
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.380
What quest love lost? I can't believe this is actually on Google.

133
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:56.960
Like I don't know what I lost. I, I,

134
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.000
I don't recall any bet I've ever lost or if I ever lost like

135
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.950
my, Oh, I've lost my luggage. Wait,

136
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.060
wait. As I'm thinking of time, every one on the side, like

137
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.220
I was like, Oh yeah, early 2018,

138
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.630
very dangerous morbid, uh, in 400,

139
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.410
like 15, 16 pounds,

140
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.440
a lot of people in my genre and whatnot,

141
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.850
they were sort of succumbing to strokes and heart attacks.

142
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:35.530
And I didn't want to be that cliche.

143
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.190
I want to live to the age of 90 and see my full life through.

144
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.390
I met the happiest I've ever been in my life. I will say that, uh, quarantining.

145
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:46.420
I know that people, uh,

146
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.250
got into the habit of panic eating and my girlfriend is not having that.

147
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.620
Nothing will ever be the moment when my band me,

148
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.190
they all put on like five pounds and I took off like 60.

149
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.540
So was a Questlove yacht rock. All right. Here's the thing.

150
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.190
My friendship with Anthony Bordain sparked because

151
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.570
of his hatred for yap rock music. When I met Anthony Bordain,

152
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.410
I asked him, I was like, is it true that you fired three chefs in your kitchen?

153
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:19.890
Because they were listening to Billy Joel. And he says, no,

154
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.550
I hung a sign up saying, I will fire you.

155
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.970
If you listen to Billy Joel in my kitchen.

156
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.250
And they defiantly put Billy Joel on. So I fired him to me. That was like, Oh,

157
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.210
challenge accepted.

158
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.660
So whenever we're Dane will come on the show on the tonight show,

159
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:40.500
he would ask like, what walk out music are you going to play for me?

160
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:45.210
And I'd tell him some like, whatever, like do some led Zeppelin song.

161
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:47.730
And he's like, yeah, yeah, some real cool. And then whenever he walks out,

162
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.420
I just played Billy Joel, just to get them angry. When he passed away,

163
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:55.170
I figured the best way to pay tribute to him.

164
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.480
And the way that really described our friendship,

165
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.710
like me getting the last word was I made him

166
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.510
like a 700 song, yacht rock playlist.

167
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.320
Or my Spotify is one of my favorite playlist. Like Jimmy, Jimmy,

168
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:12.990
Fallon's obsessed with this playlist. Like it's cool.

169
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.220
I dig it all yacht rock fans just know that I'm the King of yacht rock of course

170
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.740
loves favorite albums during quarantining.

171
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.220
I did this challenge and all my Spotify,

172
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.590
I put in order my 100 favorite records. Now I'll just tell you my top 10,

173
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.450
but all 100 in there.

174
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:34.860
So my number 10 is Stevie Wonder's music of my mind.

175
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.920
My number nine is a tribe called quest midnight marauders.

176
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.060
My number eight is 1999 by Prince number seven

177
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.340
is voodoo by D'Angelo.

178
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.430
Number six is de LA soul is dead.

179
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.570
Number five is Rufus and Chaka cons ask Rufus.

180
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.150
My number four is Michael Jackson's off the wall.

181
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.380
My number three is fantastic volume one by slim village.

182
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.330
Number two is it takes a nation of millions to hold us back by public enemy.

183
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.710
And my number one record of all time is person to person live

184
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.850
1976,

185
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:13.620
by the average white Google wait kind of light on me because I think

186
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:17.760
when any of my other friends do this, like it's the meanest things ever.

187
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.900
So it shows me that people might actually like me.

188
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.610
So that's cool.
