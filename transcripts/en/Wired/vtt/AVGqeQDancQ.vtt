1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.340
<v 0>This is a typical New York city Avenue.</v>

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.320
The New York city sidewalk cafe initiative has allowed us to take over a

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.830
lane of traffic on either side and put in sidewalk cafe.

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.660
Hi, I'm Sterling planter. I'm a restaurant and retail architect.

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.850
I've worked on the design of all of these restaurants.

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.280
I I'm going to talk about restaurant design here in New York city with COVID

7
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.683
restriction.

8
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.830
Before we get into the details of how restaurants have responded to the COVID

9
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.680
virus, we need to get into the design of restaurants,

10
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.400
pre COVID New York city restaurants are long narrow spaces,

11
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.700
typically because they're taking up the base of a tenement building.

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.640
This is a typical New York city restaurant floor plan.

13
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.210
They tend to be 20 to 25 foot wide,

14
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.100
60 to 80 foot long,

15
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.700
and have many obstacles that reduce that with even further,

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.990
including staircases elevators, service stores,

17
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:10.490
hallways, which can reduce the width down to roughly 15 feet.

18
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.800
So then COVID hit the typical restaurant that we just walked through,

19
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.280
suddenly lost all of its occupancy.

20
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.500
So pre COVID our restaurant,

21
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:25.970
which had 40 persons able to dine in the restaurant has been reduced to 10

22
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:30.260
persons. They are however allowed to expand into a lane of traffic,

23
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.730
which allows them to add 16 persons depending on the size of their space.

24
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.900
Pre COVID a restaurant's goal was to look full, to look inviting,

25
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.600
to look like a space that a person wants to go and dine in.

26
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.130
That's completely appended. Now, now you need a place that looks safe to go,

27
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.130
which is a different environment. You don't want a restaurant.

28
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:50.750
That's packed with people in doors.

29
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.650
You want a restaurant that feels like they're taking your safety seriously,

30
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.760
which means the outdoor dining is separated in July of this year.

31
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.930
New York city released guidelines for how a restaurant can expand onto the

32
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.800
streets. This is New York city's guideline diagram, a building,

33
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.130
which has a frontage, which is the width of their storefront.

34
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.180
Can then do a restaurant out on the street for outdoor dining,

35
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.410
with some exceptions. So in the beginning there were makeshift structures.

36
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.340
So these restaurant designs are simple, quick,

37
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.600
effective ways to define a space simply created using

38
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.763
construction,

39
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.930
pallets tent structures to keep the weather out tables are spaced

40
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.220
six feet apart.

41
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.380
A raised floor allows for ADA access safety barrier elements

42
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.250
that protect your patrons from traffic and the adjacent spaces.

43
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.410
So the challenge of this first phase of outdoor sidewalk dining is

44
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:53.120
that if you have a car directly adjacent to somebody sitting at a

45
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:56.480
table having dinner, it's not a very nice environment.

46
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.590
It doesn't feel like a safe, comfortable to eat.

47
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.390
You're mixing their exhaust smoke with your fine dining

48
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.224
experience.

49
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.300
Mayor DeBlasio announced that sidewalk dining would become a permanent element

50
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:12.490
of New York city. In this next phase,

51
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.950
restaurant tours had figured out a couple of ways to enhance their space,

52
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.510
very inexpensively, including adding landscaping along the perimeter,

53
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.670
barricade. This served the purpose of softening the structures as well as

54
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:32.590
providing that respite from New York city traffic exhaust another one of the

55
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.390
challenges of New York city restaurant.

56
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.890
The New York city street tends to be Arctic so that water drains into the

57
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.160
gutters. And it's really not that pleasant to be at a table.

58
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.720
That's sitting on an angle by adding a floor that's flush with the sidewalk.

59
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.610
You end up with a straight flat surface that is ADA accessible and makes for a

60
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:56.080
better dining experience. So these structures really only work in good weather.

61
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.470
Nobody wants to sit out on the street when it's raining out.

62
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.830
Sidewalk cafes have been very successful over the summer here in New York city,

63
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.560
but now we're moving into the fall and winter months when the temperature is

64
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:07.000
dropping, the question becomes,

65
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:11.590
how do you winterize an outdoor sidewalk cafe while meeting the rules of

66
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:13.780
COVID? So in New York city, in winter,

67
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.480
you're going to have rain coming from above.

68
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.380
You're going to have wind blowing from the sides, water,

69
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.230
and ice and snow building up on the streets.

70
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.850
So you're making a contained environment that shields you from these elements.

71
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.460
We start adding elements like roofs.

72
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.500
You end up adding walls and then clear vinyl sheets.

73
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.880
So what you have to be careful not to do is fully enclosed.

74
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.200
The outdoor environment, basically building a building on the street.

75
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.940
You need to keep at least 50% of your area of

76
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:52.020
walls and ceilings open. Usually one facade facing the restaurant.

77
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.350
This gives you the dual purpose of getting the airflow,

78
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.230
but also the people in the restaurant servers, wait,

79
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.470
staff can see everybody in there and take care of them.

80
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.000
They're not hidden behind a wall.

81
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.630
If you fully enclose your outdoor dining space,

82
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.360
it's no different than an indoor restaurant at that point.

83
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.110
So in the case of this greenhouse type structure,

84
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.750
this becomes indoor dining, New York city said,

85
00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:17.520
you can do that on the street as well,

86
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.700
but then you have to follow the rules of indoor dining tables need to be a

87
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:23.850
certain distance apart. You only have 25% occupancy.

88
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.310
So the goal of this next phase of sidewalk cafes it's to make a

89
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.230
pleasant experience of outdoor dining,

90
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:35.370
similar to what you had pre COVID indoor dining it's to make it year round

91
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.120
dining,

92
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.410
a space that people are comfortable going in mid summer or mid winter equally.

93
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:40.980
Well.

94
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.870
And it's basically to allow restaurant tours to have enough tables to keep

95
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:48.150
in business, to get through the end of this crisis.

96
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.220
The outdoor dining initiative in New York city has been phenomenally successful

97
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.890
prior to COVID. There were 24,000 restaurants approximately in New York city.

98
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.480
Since New York city instituted the outdoor dining over 10,000 of them have

99
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.580
opened up outdoor dining spaces.

100
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.080
Now I'm going to walk you through the restaurant design pre and post COVID.

101
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.310
You start out on the street, storefront signage.

102
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.400
That's your first experience of the restaurant. As you walk in,

103
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.760
how you're greeted is your second part of the experience,

104
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.140
then you actually get to sit at your table and your experience is taken over by

105
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:27.770
the food, the atmosphere and the service in the restaurant.

106
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.330
So post COVID the experience of walking up to a restaurant is very different.

107
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.710
You need to socially distance,

108
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.620
you've got your six foot space decals on the street.

109
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.550
The dots that have been put on sidewalks and everything else around the city are

110
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:44.600
fairly effective. When you come in, you no longer see diners right away.

111
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.290
What you see as a host stand with takeout instructions.

112
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.320
So you're picking up orders, having food to go.

113
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.490
Part of the signage package that's involved in a restaurant now are things like

114
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:59.420
face covering requirements. How you go to the bathroom in a restaurant,

115
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.640
what the rules are when you're in the restaurant.

116
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.520
So these photos are of restaurants, obviously pre COVID,

117
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.820
which show the activity. The interaction of people.

118
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.620
The primary directive is to get the people at the tables that are able to be

119
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.710
seen from the exterior food and beverages,

120
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.830
both look better under natural light post COVID.

121
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.480
You're going to have far fewer people.

122
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.450
You're going to lose every other table here.

123
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.840
Many restaurants have introduced signage on the tables,

124
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.990
which includes things like QR codes for the menus.

125
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.830
One of the main advantages to restaurants that this is brought out is they can

126
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:38.690
now change their menu on a daily basis without having to reprint reformat their

127
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.220
menus everything's on the phones.

128
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.570
So that's how the restaurant experience has changed post COVID. Now,

129
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:47.240
I'm going to talk about the future of dining in New York city.

130
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.840
So as we move into the next phase of sidewalk, cafes,

131
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.300
New York can learn a lot from European cities.

132
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.860
Well outdoor dining in New York city and taking back streets from vehicular

133
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.760
traffic is something new for us in Europe. It's been happening for years.

134
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.460
European cities have plazas sidewalks,

135
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.780
all filled with outdoor dining and seating situations.

136
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.490
It's part of the urban fabric of those cities. And it's very successful.

137
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.350
It makes the streets safer.

138
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.150
It makes them more active and it extends the life of those sidewalks and cafes

139
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.640
further into the evening or earlier in the morning,

140
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:24.740
because it's part of the cityscape.

141
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.820
So some of the things we can learn from European cities and how they interact

142
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:33.650
with their outdoor dining is that it doesn't have to be an interference in the

143
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:35.000
sidewalk or streetscape.

144
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.800
In some cases they've extended the storefront out onto the street or

145
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:43.490
sidewalk. They've allowed it to be part of the restaurant,

146
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.110
just an outdoor portion of it.

147
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.570
And similar to what we're doing here in New York city,

148
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.040
they've created platforms that are separate from the restaurant and the sidewalk

149
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:52.874
goes between them.

150
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.660
Some of the more successful restaurants have faced all of the seats towards the

151
00:08:57.661 --> 00:09:00.750
street. It becomes an interactive viewing, almost like theater.

152
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.070
Some of the streets in Europe that are most famous for doing this are the,

153
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.690
the Elisa in Paris or Loram Los in Barcelona, where having sidewalk,

154
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.780
cafes and dining has not only become a draw for it.

155
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.360
It's become a tourist attraction in its own. Right?

156
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.440
One of the big design challenges in New York city is that we don't have service

157
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:23.310
ways or alleyways behind the buildings, any sidewalk, cafes,

158
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.880
or outdoor dining that we design are going to have to compete with those

159
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:29.040
services for space on the street.

160
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.820
COVID is accelerated program in New York city called open streets,

161
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.090
treats closed or mostly closed for [inaudible] traffic.

162
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.840
Opening them up for pedestrians and non vehicular uses.

163
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.340
New York city had 87 separate open street designations

164
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.840
spread throughout the city.

165
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.650
So this is what a New York city open street might look like.

166
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.760
You've got sidewalk dining on either side, you've opened up to pedestrians.

167
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.460
It becomes like a block party. That's permanent.

168
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.360
What the future might hold is a full greening of New York city,

169
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.680
where it's not just closing down a couple streets and putting in painted

170
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:08.040
plazas. You add green scape. You add trees,

171
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:12.660
you add landscaping and New York city becomes a much greener and

172
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.830
friendlier place to be.

173
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.150
The overall effect of this would be turning avenues in New York city into linear

174
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:19.830
parks. Similar to the highlight

175
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.190
Going by the numbers.

176
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.460
New York city restaurants are definitely in trouble due to COVID.

177
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.230
They've been closed down for many months.

178
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.700
Estimates are approximately 40% of the restaurants in New York city will not

179
00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:36.140
make it through this crisis.

180
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.030
Architects and designers are assisting restaurants as quickly as possible to

181
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:45.350
help them make these cafes work, make sidewalk, cafes, winterized,

182
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:49.130
and be able to work year round and become a permanent part of the New York city

183
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.030
streetscape.

184
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.920
The COVID has obviously been a horrendous impediment to restaurants in New York

185
00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:59.420
city. However, there is a silver lining despite the tragedy of the disease.

186
00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:04.070
It has allowed us to help reshape the city and how

187
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.350
residents and tourists visiting it, interact.

188
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.250
<v 2>With the environment.</v>
