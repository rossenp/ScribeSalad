00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>Politicians realize that non-verbals are important.</v>

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.410
And so when they choose an outfit,

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.650
when they choose how they're going to come out,

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.060
whether or not they're going to be smiling or shaking hands,

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.440
one thing I can assure you,

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.220
this has been rehearsed many times it is theater,

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.620
it's absolute theater.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.780
And one of the things that we will be looking for is how well these actors do

9
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:28.614
their job.

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.610
My name's Joe Navarro. And for 25 years,

11
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:37.430
I was a spy catcher with the FBI.

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.640
And I am a nonverbal communications expert.

13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.390
As we approach the height of the political season.

14
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.480
The question I'm asked is, you know, what do you look for?

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.220
And the body language of the people that will be in the

16
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.200
debates. I look at everything that's involved because we have to look at all the

17
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.813
non-verbals, right?

18
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.420
Just when the candidates come on stage, um,

19
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.070
they're always waving at somebody in the audience or pointing a finger and so

20
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:10.460
forth.

21
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.350
Sometimes these are actually bogus gestures because they know the camera's

22
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.310
in the audience will take pictures anytime there's a large gesture.

23
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.810
And so they may actually do these things with no one in mind.

24
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.730
You'll notice that rarely are debaters allowed to

25
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.490
stand or sit close to each other.

26
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:35.990
Usually there's at least seven to 10 feet of space.

27
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.540
And the reason for that is debaters.

28
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.780
Actually don't want you to see that there is a height difference.

29
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.010
And so by separating the two individuals,

30
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.200
we don't notice that difference.

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.820
You'll see an unusual amount of the color blue in the background,

32
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.960
somewhere between the color of the ocean and the sky,

33
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.410
which is soothing to the human brain,

34
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.240
the wearing of a Navy blue suit,

35
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.560
white shirts, often a red or burgundy tie.

36
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.420
Subconsciously we see the significance of that because it is

37
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.240
what we see in the American flag. Red, white,

38
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:21.470
and blue what's really become ubiquitous is the

39
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.040
lapel pen of the American flag.

40
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.510
This is something that 30 years ago, even 20 years ago,

41
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.130
we hardly saw. But now it's almost part of our attire. You know,

42
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:35.150
if you think about it,

43
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:39.650
is someone less patriotic because on this day they're not wearing the American

44
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:44.510
flag. Of course not. This is reaching out to you at a subconscious level.

45
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.100
It's part of the theater, part of the orchestration,

46
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:51.110
which we now, uh.

47
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.713
<v 1>We're looking for.</v>

48
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 0>Or their behaviors to see are these with what we have seen in the past.</v>

49
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.220
We certainly shouldn't be using body language to try to determine if they're

50
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.510
speaking the truth.

51
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.520
These are orchestrated events and that's not what we use body language

52
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:17.050
for. We use body language to supplement and

53
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:19.840
confirm what we are seeing.

54
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.250
Are the words being supported by the gestures,

55
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.570
or are their gestures taking away from their words?

56
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.460
What I look for is, as the moderator asks the question,

57
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.010
do I see lip biting?

58
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.810
Do I see any kind of ventilating behavior such as pulling on the collar?

59
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.930
Do I see any kind of facial distress?

60
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.330
Do I see furrowing of the forehead?

61
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.480
<v 2>They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way. Oh really?</v>

62
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.920
Oh really? Here's the thing.

63
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.560
<v 0>The thing that might indicate to me that the individual doesn't</v>

64
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:02.190
like the question he or she is being asked.

65
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.530
<v 2>Would you shut up? Listen, who is the other.</v>

66
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.870
<v 0>Thing I look for is any kind of hesitation throat clear?</v>

67
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.900
<v 2>Are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists</v>

68
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.600
specifically, perhaps.

69
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.560
<v 0>The raising of a shoulder, the lowering of a shoulder.</v>

70
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.990
<v 2>Stand back and stand by anything.</v>

71
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.040
<v 0>That conveys lack of confidence. I want to see the hands.</v>

72
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.060
I want to see those thumbs that come up because when we're confident,

73
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.560
the thumbs pop up, when we lack confidence, they come down.

74
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:37.770
I want to see if there's any kind of stapling.

75
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.310
Stapling is a high indicator of confidence,

76
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.730
or do we see the interlacing of the fingers,

77
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.960
which is I'm struggling with something or I'm having difficulty.

78
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.890
One of the ones that you may not even think about, nothing will ever be said,

79
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.210
but you'll see behaviors like the light touching of the eye with the

80
00:04:57.211 --> 00:04:58.020
fingertip.

81
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.460
This is both a blocking behavior and a comforting behavior.

82
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.940
One of the facial nerves that attends to the eyelid.

83
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.490
The minute we put pressure on that nerve,

84
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.450
it begins to send messages to the brain to calm down. What,

85
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.010
in essence they're saying is I screwed up or I really don't like that.

86
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.240
One of the things that happens in political debates are the things that we never

87
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.080
planned for, for instance, in 2016. Now,

88
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:29.310
president Trump walking behind Hillary Clinton during the

89
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:33.840
debates, it almost looked like he was stalking her. I mean,

90
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:38.220
I can just imagine me trying to talk to the camera right now with somebody

91
00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:42.540
loitering behind me that actually actuates a limbic

92
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:43.470
response.

93
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.390
So we may see behaviors that arise as a

94
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:51.450
result of the action of another candidate.

95
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.050
And we certainly saw that in 2016, when, uh,

96
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.900
some candidates refused to shake the hands of others or when

97
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:04.040
humor was used, when it really wasn't well-intended.

98
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.470
And that's when we see authenticity,

99
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.420
that's when we really see what is in the heart and the mind and the sentiment

100
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.240
of this individual and how they react to it.

101
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.530
Gestures and communication are all

102
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.380
intertwined. They're not two separate things.

103
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.530
We know that because we've done research.

104
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.410
And when we restrict people's hands,

105
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.350
they in fact have less recall.

106
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.600
They're in fact less energetic and they communicate much

107
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:40.220
less. We used to say, you know, when somebody in authority, gestures,

108
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.660
they need to adjust your wide and they need to gesture smoothly.

109
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.640
And of course in the zoom world,

110
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.840
those gestures need to be up here where people can see them.

111
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.580
Humans are so sensitive to non-verbals that if I were to

112
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.490
point my finger at the audience and say, you,

113
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.260
we actually have a visceral reaction to that, which is usually very negative.

114
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.950
And I think about how many times a school teacher has called on us.

115
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:08.480
And it's gone like that.

116
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.370
We know that if we turn that gesture into an open Palm vertical gesture,

117
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.630
we like that.

118
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.070
We prefer that probably the most popular one is this thumb

119
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:23.420
gesture that you often see the candidate is making a point

120
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.430
and the thumb is just barely sticking out from beyond the index

121
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:32.960
finger. Anytime we grasp something, we're saying,

122
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:36.680
I'm talking to you about something that's important to me,

123
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:40.880
I'm sort of grasping it, which has to be differentiated for instance,

124
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:44.240
for when we talk. And we say with precision,

125
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.680
so this is a precision grip. I want you to think about this.

126
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.600
So some of the other gestures we'll see is the open Palm gesture shows that

127
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:57.560
we're open, that we are receptive. The palms are up,

128
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.520
the fingers are wide. Um, this is a very appealing.

129
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.230
Some of the other gestures we may see is if the person is doing

130
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:06.680
this.

131
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.480
So normally a Baton gesture is a cadence behavior that

132
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.350
denotes, I am asking you to come visit me.

133
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.310
But when we do it this way, what we're in fact, uh,

134
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.140
saying if we slow it down is I'm really not so much behind

135
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:28.220
that because it's literally pushing away rather than being

136
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:31.910
receptive. The other behavior we may see is, um,

137
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.130
the touching of the heart and the chest,

138
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.290
which we often see portrayed as so-called honesty displays.

139
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.270
They are in fact neutral because I've seen both individuals that are guilty

140
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:47.120
of crimes and the innocent use this gesture.

141
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:49.790
So it gives the appearance of being honest,

142
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.490
but it doesn't mean that they're being honest.

143
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.420
So one of the questions I'm asked is do politicians rehearse their hand

144
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:58.050
gestures?

145
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.820
Some do some don't some absolutely refuse to receive any kind of

146
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:07.260
training. Others are well coached. The question is, you know,

147
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:12.030
how much of it is authentically theirs and how much of it is

148
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.570
a borrowed. Usually if they've been in office a long time,

149
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.360
or they've been in politics for a long time,

150
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.360
they will be reluctant to change any of their numbers.

151
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.000
Let's look at president Trump's gestures.

152
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.040
His most favored one is to talk with the index finger, to the thumb.

153
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.950
<v 1>Glorious nation under God. Sometimes.</v>

154
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.630
<v 0>He does the elbow flop as he's emphasizing.</v>

155
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.680
I don't see any protests.

156
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:47.360
Oftentimes his eyelids will come down to block when he's hearing something,

157
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:48.740
he doesn't like,

158
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.850
you can see the money pinches the corner of his mouth when he's being

159
00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:57.380
sarcastic or exercising disdain or contempt.

160
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.300
He does the lip pers when he disagrees or doesn't like a question being asked.

161
00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:06.920
And then of course he does the lip poll when he definitely doesn't like the

162
00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:09.740
question being asked. And if you notice,

163
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.100
anytime he's sitting in the white house, surrounded by people,

164
00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:17.150
he always hugs himself. And yet when you compare him to,

165
00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:21.740
when he's on his show, the apprentice, he always has a territorial display.

166
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.160
And you see this contrast and you have to ask yourself,

167
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:30.020
why do we see this behavior on a TV show and

168
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:34.520
why we're not seeing this? Um, in a, in a presidential cabinet,

169
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.310
let's look at Joe Biden's gestures.

170
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.540
He does a lot of lip touching. We call it a pensive behavior.

171
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:46.430
You often see it as people are pondering when he's making a point, uh,

172
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.540
he tends to Pharaoh, his glabella, he squints his eyes.

173
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.190
Voice often is lowered for emphasis. You should go out and vote.

174
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.300
And as with many people, um, when something bothers him,

175
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.860
the lips disappear. And this is something that I'm often asked about.

176
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.530
Does this have anything to do with the section?

177
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.170
And it has absolutely nothing to do with deception.

178
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:14.240
These are the behaviors that we adopt and that we use that

179
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:18.560
help us to communicate what we're thinking about at that

180
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:19.310
moment.

181
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.600
Rarely do people remember what is said,

182
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.010
but we tend to remember the images to this day.

183
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.860
We still teach about, uh,

184
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.720
governor Dukakis on a military tank wearing this tankers helmet

185
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.390
and how odd he'd looked. And, you know,

186
00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:41.150
we scoffed sometimes at the non-verbals.

187
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.310
And yet here was one that we can clearly show that just from a pairing

188
00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:49.760
on that tank, it really diminished his posture.

189
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.371
You know,

190
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:59.290
some people see these behaviors as a short hand,

191
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.630
I wouldn't call it that behaviors,

192
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:04.330
gestures are part of communication.

193
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.420
We have primarily communicated non-verbally.

194
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.720
We find ourselves using these gestures all the time,

195
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:14.620
and there's a reason for it. People usually respond to them.

196
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.560
People that know us well respond to them.

197
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.390
And so we don't separate them as ancillary to

198
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:26.080
communication. They are in fact, part of community.

199
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:30.780
