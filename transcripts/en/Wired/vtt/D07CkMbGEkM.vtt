1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>We were looking for the plans and the intentions of our enemies.</v>

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 1>There are a lot of ways to.</v>

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 0>Collect intelligence.</v>

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.670
Cameras was my preferred method of collection.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.830
My name is John Mendez. I'm the former chief of disguise at CIA.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.050
And before that I was a photo operations officer at CIA.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.790
There was an interesting history of using homing pigeons to collect

8
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:32.840
intelligence.

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.060
We all learned that we could put harnesses and cameras on the pigeons.

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.610
They were very, very small.

11
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.530
The combined weight of the harness and the camera was one and a half

12
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.453
ounces.

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.720
The cameras in question were motorized cameras,

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.520
battery operated cameras that would take pictures at pre

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.130
determined intervals.

16
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.850
The pigeons must've looked absolutely innocent,

17
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.180
Flying over whatever their targets were.

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.820
One of the beautiful things about a homing pigeon of course,

19
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.540
is it will always come back. And so we would put our lasers,

20
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.900
they'd fly over the Navy field. We'd bring them back home.

21
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.190
We'd develop their film.

22
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.080
And the reports are that the precision in their photographs was very

23
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:28.880
good. At least as good as what we had in satellite photography.

24
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.490
<v 1>At the time, the Minox.</v>

25
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.330
<v 0>Camera was an amazing camera for its day.</v>

26
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.180
It was really the first submitted your camera.

27
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.320
It was about three inches long with fit in the Palm of your hand.

28
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.830
You could take pictures, unbeknownst to anybody else.

29
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:49.250
You didn't even need to be a spy to do it because this was a commercially

30
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.570
available camera.

31
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.560
You could copy anything with a Minox the people that were using them for the

32
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.360
foreign agents who had access to the intelligence who could get right

33
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.360
up next to the documents and take the picture.

34
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.470
Agents were always in a time crunch. And when you get down to the nitty gritty,

35
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:08.750
when you're actually taking the photos,

36
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.250
which is an act of espionage in most of those situations,

37
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.250
it was usually you wanted to get in and out and,

38
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.690
and not be caught doing what you were doing.

39
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.700
It was the toughest part of an operation.

40
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.800
We were photographing documents that would give us the information we needed.

41
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.690
Typically they might be minutes from a meeting or an agenda for a meeting

42
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.710
talking about what our enemies were getting ready to do. Next.

43
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.030
There are many ways to conceal cameras.

44
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.870
This camera is the tessina camera and it could fit in a cigarette box.

45
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.010
Another concealed camera was the matchbox camera.

46
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.320
The fun part about the matchbox camera was that it was just a box with a camera

47
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:58.250
in it, but it looked like a matchbox and you could get, um,

48
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.250
back then everybody had these wooden matchboxes and you could take the label off

49
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.660
whatever local restaurant or hotel and put it on your matchbox. Cameron,

50
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.470
there's another category of body worn cameras.

51
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.220
And there were two particular cameras that were interesting in that regard.

52
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.250
One was called it to Siena. The other one was called a robot.

53
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.440
They were both spring wound,

54
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.880
but you could get a group of pictures without touching the camera.

55
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.870
And without physically touching the shutter mechanism,

56
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.670
you could put one in a bra, a tie, a belt, a pregnant woman,

57
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.743
a button.

58
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.580
They are kind of all part of a group of places to put cameras where they

59
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.720
wouldn't be expected,

60
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.400
where they would probably not be discovered and where you'd be able to

61
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.230
covertly take some pictures that your office thought was

62
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:53.980
necessary. And you'd actuate them by putting your hand in your pocket,

63
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.110
by putting your hand on the strap of your purse by a hundred different

64
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:03.130
ways and take the picture. If you're wearing a body-worn camera,

65
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.550
you're more interested in the place that you're at, the place that you're going.

66
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.480
You might want to see who's meeting with who who's interacting with,

67
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:15.460
who you might want to see a walking by a building that usually doesn't have

68
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.200
an open door what's in there.

69
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.210
There were lots of ways to conceal these cameras and we'll use them all.

70
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.740
I love it. I loved the trope Hill pin camera.

71
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.790
We only gave these cameras to our very, very best agents.

72
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.500
The one that had the very best access these cameras were

73
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:35.340
handmade.

74
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.710
The Tropez was the smallest concealed camera that we had was

75
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:41.850
made by one. Man.

76
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.840
It contained an optic that was eight tiny,

77
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.690
tiny pieces of glass stacked on top of each other.

78
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.330
And it couldn't be duplicated anywhere in the world.

79
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.460
The troll Pell camera could go places that nothing else could go

80
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.440
and collected just amazing intelligence for the central intelligence

81
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:05.670
agency. So I wanted to be 13 inches off of the piece of paper.

82
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.530
So in the training you teach the agent that he was the tripod,

83
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.720
a token chef,

84
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.560
who was a foreign agent who used our tropical pen consumer device to

85
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:21.330
a great effect. His case was amazing. He was called the billion dollar spy.

86
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.540
And that was because with his photography,

87
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.190
he collected the plans and intentions of the Soviet union as regards

88
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.840
its weapon system, 10 years out it's radar systems airborne.

89
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.460
And on the ground he collected, he had the schematics, he photographed them.

90
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.570
The department of defense at the Pentagon received them. And they said,

91
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.720
this has saved us years and years of R and D.

92
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.130
And the money that we would spend doing the R and D because we have the plans

93
00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:53.280
for their next generation of defensive weapons.

94
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.580
The TRO Pell camera was a breakthrough and size and the quality of the

95
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.020
images that it would produce.

96
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.190
There was really never anything like it before.

97
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.000
And I think there was nothing like it. Since next,

98
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.370
I'm going to talk about microdot technology.

99
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.110
The microdot is a very secure method of communication.

100
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.100
A microdot is taking at eight and a half by 11 page of text,

101
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.220
just a regular piece of paper and reducing it down.

102
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.040
And it ends up being about the size of a period at

103
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:32.720
the end of a sentence and the international edition of time magazine.

104
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.470
Even if someone hands you the magazine,

105
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.730
it says there's a microdot in the magazine. You will never,

106
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.700
if you don't know the page in the paragraph and the sentence,

107
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.260
you won't find the microdot, we'd send it to our foreign agent.

108
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.550
And he would know,

109
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.500
maybe we'd send him a secret writing message that says your package will arrive

110
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.060
along with time magazine. We have some code to tell him the page, the paragraph.

111
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.250
So I'm holding a couple of microdots that have been concealed behind

112
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.450
a stamp. We've separated the stamp from the sticky backing.

113
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.860
And so if you can see there's a microdot in each corner,

114
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.650
when this stamp is put onto an envelope,

115
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.680
these microdots become absolutely invisible.

116
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.610
The agent would whatever it was adhered to he'd tear it out.

117
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.200
He put it in a cup of water.

118
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.590
The dock would float off because it's water soluble, glue holding it.

119
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.480
And the agent would have a lens. It used to be called a Fresno lens.

120
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.160
It looked like a grain rice to get a piece of cardboard and he'd punch a hole in

121
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:38.810
it and he'd take his Fresnel lens and he put it in the home

122
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.770
and then he put some spit in his finger, pick up the dot,

123
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.540
put it on the end of the Fresno lens and hold it up to the sun or a light.

124
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.880
And he could read an eight and a half by 11 page of text. It was fabulous.

125
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.650
It was very secure. Photography played a large role in the cold war.

126
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.480
Some things that were just myths.

127
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.860
We were able to prove some things that were rumors we were able to disprove

128
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.330
photography is sort of the indisputable truth.

129
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.840
Very often. Not that the documents can't be wrong,

130
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.430
but over time and distance photography has been able to

131
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:20.660
provide the information that the intelligence agency has been after.

132
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.190
It's an important tool, even though technology has changed a lot

133
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.350
Tradecraft hasn't.
