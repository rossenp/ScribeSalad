00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.030
<v 0>Surveillance in Moscow was the most difficult kind of surveillance</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.650
that we encountered around the world.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
We didn't have Paris rules or witness Aries rules.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.070
There were no other rules except Moscow rules,

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
because it was such a difficult place for us to work. Hi,

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.980
I'm Jonathan Mendez. I'm the former chief of disguise for the CIA. Today.

7
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.640
I'm going to talk about some of the CIA's gadgets that we use during the cold

8
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.930
war. I worked for the office of technical service at the CIA.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.490
We used to always think of it as CIA S Q. We were the gadget people.

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.740
Everything that we did in Moscow had to be done clandestinely.

11
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400
You couldn't overtly go out and collect intelligence.

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.260
We all had surveillance 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.880
It didn't matter where you were. If you were in your apartment,

14
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.920
which would be in an embassy compound,

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.030
you'd have surveillance in the walls and it would be live surveillance.

16
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.540
We had something of a breakthrough and, uh,

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.910
determining whether or not we had surveillance.

18
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:10.140
And that was a piece of equipment that we call the SRR 100.

19
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:14.940
It was actually composed of three different pieces. One was some small Phonek.

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.450
You were devices that went into your ear. They were earpieces,

21
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840
and they were actually commercially available well,

22
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.760
but we would mold your ear and create a new

23
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:29.330
inner ear for you. That would sit in on top of the phone act.

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.220
We would paint them to match your ear. There was a neck ring that went with it.

25
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.950
It was an induction piece of technology.

26
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.650
And then there was a receiver itself.

27
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.070
Those were tuned into KGB surveillance frequencies.

28
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.630
And we had a fairly comfortable sense that if we had

29
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:51.890
surveillance following us, they were using radios.

30
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.000
We were on their frequency that we would be able to hear them,

31
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.480
that we would be able to correlate if we turned right.

32
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.460
Or if we turned left that we would hear them calling that out.

33
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.580
He's turning right. He's turning left. It wasn't foolproof,

34
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.170
but it was enough to give us a very good sense of if there was

35
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:17.000
anybody back there knowing that you were being watched would mean that that

36
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.600
day, all you would do is perfectly innocuous things.

37
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.260
You would not do anything operational that day because you were under

38
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:28.370
surveillance. Another method of losing surveillance was using one of our Sams,

39
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:30.350
one of our semiautomated masks, right?

40
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.420
It was a mask that would allow you to apply different

41
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.610
disguise materials all at one time,

42
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.130
which would allow you to get in the car wherever you are.

43
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.940
You were wearing your true face. And somewhere along the way,

44
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.210
putting on your new face, your Sam mask.

45
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.580
And after you'd taken two right-hand turns and stepped out of the

46
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.570
car. When surveillance came down the street, they would see what,

47
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.580
maybe it looked like a Russian man walking toward them and the car they were

48
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:04.440
following still up ahead of them. And they would go right by you.

49
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.780
So that if you were a blonde unshaven and mustached young

50
00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:13.980
man and needed to wear a disguise that night, that might have a dark beard,

51
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.790
dark mustache, dark hair, maybe a different skin tone.

52
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.160
Instead of having to sit in front of a mirror and assemble that on your face,

53
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.920
you would just take your Sam mask. And so it had a nickname,

54
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.920
the five second mask, five on five off,

55
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.880
but there was one last piece that had to crumble down to almost nothing and fit

56
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:36.750
under your armpit.

57
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.210
If you are being pursued and you had to take it off and had to turn into

58
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.850
your real self, you had to be able to conceal it.

59
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.410
Another time technique that we used with the masks was an operation called

60
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
[inaudible]. We had a couple getting ready to go to Moscow, and we asked

61
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
 them to buy a dog and take the dog with him

62
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
. A very large dog, a particular dog. We went to our wig maker

63
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
. We showed the wig maker a picture of the great big dog. And she made not a wig, but she made a dog, just 

64
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
a

65
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
 covering that looked like a dog that you could put in the back seat of a car. And it would look like your dog was asleep in the 

66
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
backseat

67
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
. That couple would set a pattern of every, I don't know how often, but every so often they would leave the embassy compound with their dog. And so the man at the gate, 

68
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.490
we

69
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.323
 get used to seeing them go through the gate with their dog in the backseat, not always asleep, sometimes asleep.

70
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.670
And then when we needed operationally to move a person,

71
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.710
that person would get in the car under the dog concealment and

72
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:47.130
go through the gate. And the milli man would blink twice.

73
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.100
And that was a way to move a person around.

74
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.760
We had a device called the Jack in the box or a jib.

75
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.710
When we use the jib,

76
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.210
dummy would pop up out of a concealment device,

77
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.630
replacing the officer who had just stepped out of the car.

78
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.380
And so the way it would typically work is the driver would get in the car,

79
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.310
the passenger,

80
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:12.060
which would be the case officer who needed to get out of the car and go do his

81
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:16.200
operational stuff. He'd be in the passenger seat.

82
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.920
And so they'd go out through the gate and their surveillance team would pull in

83
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:24.390
behind them and they'd go on a pre determined route one that they had

84
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:27.570
planned specifically to do a car escape.

85
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.020
They would find a right turn followed by another right turn.

86
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.660
They would have disconnected their brake lights.

87
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.740
The officer would open the door, step out of the car.

88
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.200
The driver would take the purse,

89
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.890
the attache set it on the passenger seat,

90
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.140
push the button thing would pop up. Surveillance comes around the corner.

91
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.700
There's still two silhouettes in the car, moving down the street, not too fast.

92
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.190
And our officer would be free to go and do an operational act.

93
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.440
This was a very important tool.

94
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.760
And once an agent loses their surveillance and is

95
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:09.590
absolutely certain that they have lost their surveillance, they can do anything.

96
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.320
Dan drop is the way we would package the information that we were

97
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.490
giving to the agent,

98
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.440
where we could put our questions for the agent in some sort of a concealment

99
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:26.120
device and put it on the ground somewhere or in a tree or wherever the proper

100
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:27.830
place was determined to be. And they,

101
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.820
on the other hand could give us the answers to our questions by doing the same

102
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:34.070
thing. It could be a list of requirements.

103
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.720
We could be passing to him medicine for his son who was sick. It could be money,

104
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.000
whatever we needed to pass to the agent had to be concealed so that it wasn't

105
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.100
apparent what it was because we were going to put it down somewhere and leave it

106
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.890
unattended and put up a signal.

107
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:56.660
So he'd know to come and get it a signal to an agent. It's a prearranged.

108
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:58.460
So the agent knows what to look for.

109
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.370
It could be a lipstick Mark on a telephone pole.

110
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.170
It could be a light in a window.

111
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.550
It could be moving a flower pot on a balcony from one side to another.

112
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.360
It was an endless supply of possibilities for signals.

113
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.520
The dead drop that that has gotten the most attention over the years

114
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.803
is the dead rat.

115
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.000
We determined early on that a dead rat was pretty much untouchable in

116
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.710
any country, in any religion, by any people,

117
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.370
no one will pick up a dead rat. They just won't. So we did,

118
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.020
we picked up dead rats and we took them to the taxidermist and they tie-dyed

119
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:38.090
them up. And they Velcroed their tummies. Oh.

120
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.220
And they dipped them in Tabasco sauce.

121
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.030
Tabasco was in case an animal picked up your dead rat.

122
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.360
You could fit more in a dead rat than you might think.

123
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.120
If you were determined to get a certain number of rubles or a

124
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.930
certain number of questions, or maybe some old antique jewelry,

125
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.500
if you roll dollar bills up real tight with rubber bands,

126
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.930
you can get a lot of dollar bills in rubles.

127
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.690
I think I liked one that we put down for Tricon early on,

128
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.650
over Rodnick, over Rodnick was his Soviet name.

129
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.540
Tragon was his code name.

130
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.530
He was giving us information on the strategic arms limitations talks.

131
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.560
It was called the salt talks. This was salt too.

132
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.040
He was giving us a Soviet bottom line on negotiating,

133
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:29.120
what they were willing to do and below which they would not go, which is like,

134
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:33.380
if you're playing poker, it's like having the other guy's cards in your hands.

135
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.543
And we left,

136
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.020
I believe it was his first drop and we left it and in a dirty construction club,

137
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.230
just one just on the ground by phone booth,

138
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.570
that was the first thing he picked up from us.

139
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.830
We devised many concealment devices in OTs,

140
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:51.650
and some of them were used for escape scenarios.

141
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.140
The false scrotum is a really interesting story.

142
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.210
We were always interested in the possibility of our officers

143
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:07.080
being captured and maybe being held prisoner around the world.

144
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:11.790
Our officers needed to be able to hide some

145
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.020
tools so that they could make an attempt to escape if that happened to them.

146
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.820
And the theory is that the false scrotum was one such concealment

147
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:21.654
device.

148
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.730
And the question about the false scrotum is whether it was ever actually

149
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.593
used.

150
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.040
If you were going to be in a situation where you would be strip searched,

151
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.300
you might in advance knowing that you were going into a life and death

152
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:40.710
situation, prepare yourself like Houdini to have some escape tools.

153
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.390
The rectal tool kit was a little bit like a suppository.

154
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.490
I just put it in case you needed it.

155
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.620
It was important that it be very well-made that it'd be very smooth surface

156
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.070
that it not cause any injury coming or going,

157
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.710
but inside of it were small tools that could be used in a variety

158
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:04.260
of ways. It was, um, not a bad idea.

159
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.460
So some of these agents that worked for us knew that there was not a good end

160
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.070
date if it ended. And they said, well, only work for you.

161
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.100
If you give us cyanide pills.

162
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.780
The first two that I know of, we gave out in pens, in writing pens,

163
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.250
they were in the cap of the pen.

164
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:27.560
What we're looking at here is a cyanide pill that was put in the boast STEM

165
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.850
of a pair of glasses.

166
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.800
And the way it was constructed is that the agents in order to access the pill

167
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:36.920
would just take off his glasses and just

168
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.740
bite down on the earpiece.

169
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.340
There was a glass ampule inside with the cyanide in it.

170
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.400
It was a desperate measure, but they were desperate times.

171
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.570
And these men knew that they didn't want to go through the interrogation and the

172
00:10:50.571 --> 00:10:55.190
torture that the KGB had in mind before they were executed Tragon was

173
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.180
arrested at home. In his office. The KGB came in,

174
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.510
they had found all of his tools, all of his supplies.

175
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.850
He had nowhere to go.

176
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.260
And so they had him stripped of his clothes. He just had on his skivvies.

177
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.670
And he said to them,

178
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.960
I will write my confession when I want to write it with my pen, my pen,

179
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.750
he wanted his mum black pen, and they gave it to him.

180
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.350
And my office OTs had milled out the cap.

181
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.940
So he,

182
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.740
he took the cap off and he put it on top and he

183
00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:30.230
looked at them and he just bit down on it.

184
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.270
The Russian said he was dead before he hit the floor. I hope

185
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:37.723
that's what he wanted

186
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.210
working in Moscow really was a life and death operation.

187
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:50.090
All the time. You were risking the life of your agent. You made a mistake.

188
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.370
You were always worried if your equipment wasn't working your trade craft,

189
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:57.520
wasn't what it should be. Whenever someone got caught,

190
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:59.410
you went home and thought, Oh God,

191
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.480
is it something that I did that I make the mistake while these devices were

192
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.160
primarily used during the cold war?

193
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.970
Some version of these devices is in use today,

194
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.170
the business of meeting with spies and collecting intelligence and transmitting

195
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:19.090
the intelligence. Those things don't change how we do it might change,

196
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.880
but it's still the same work.
