00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 0>Maize or corn is one of the most widely grown grains in the world.</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.710
And as a staple in many of our diets,

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.210
but what you might not know is that the way that much of it is processed has

4
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.110
contributed to making millions of people sick and killing hundreds of thousands

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:20.310
over the past 500 years. I'm Dr. Bill Schindler, food, archeologists,

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.060
chef and director of the Eastern shore food lab at Washington college,

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.100
our modern approach to food processing,

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.110
which prioritizes convenience and profit over safety and nutrition has

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:35.760
negatively impacted the nutritional value of maze for our human bodies. However,

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
there is a process that will transform maze into its most nutritious and

11
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:44.090
delicious form, but that process has yet to be adopted by most of the world.

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.400
And that's what we're going to talk about today.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.780
Geological evidence suggests that maize domestication may have started thousands

14
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.060
of years ago in the boss's Valley of Mexico.

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.700
It comes from a wild grass known as Teo Senti.

16
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.770
And these right here are grains from the wild Taya scent. They plant now,

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.820
archeologists are not even sure why maize domestication even started in the

18
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:12.050
first place. Was it for food? Was it for the alcohol they create out of it?

19
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.620
Was it for some utilitarian purpose or was it for something else altogether?

20
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.520
What we do know is that the genetic mutations that have occurred have

21
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:24.110
transformed wild PEO synthy grains into Temaze. As we know it today,

22
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.233
for example,

23
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.500
early versions of Mays had colonels that were individually wrapped just like

24
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:34.460
this. This required a tremendous amount of time and labor to harvest.

25
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.290
So early farmers were able to genetically modify maze to produce a cob covered

26
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:41.090
by one husk. Like we know it today.

27
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.980
These types of transformations increase the volume of food and decrease the

28
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:49.460
amount of work necessary to access that food. However,

29
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.810
maze is one of the most difficult grains in the world for our human digestive

30
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:57.710
tracks to fully break down and from which to derive the maximum amount of

31
00:01:57.711 --> 00:01:58.310
nutrition,

32
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.390
it is very high in cellulose and insoluble fiber that our bodies can not break

33
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:02.780
down.

34
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.860
And some of the nutrients exist in forms that our bodies just can't access.

35
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.700
However,

36
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.240
early farmers discovered a process known as [inaudible], which provided their 

37
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.073
bodies access to that nutrition.

38
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.950
Originally this process involves steeping kernels of maze in a solution of water

39
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:23.690
and wood Ash, but over time,

40
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.450
what Astros replaced with lye and even pickling lime,

41
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.220
but the process remains the same.

42
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.150
The mixture of a base with water creates an alkaline solution,

43
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.530
which chemically and physically transforms the maze into its safest and most

44
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:39.350
nourishing form possible for our digestive tracks.

45
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.170
Ms. Thomas station has many benefits. For instance,

46
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.730
it detoxifies grains and neutralizes. Anti-nutrients such as phytic acid.

47
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.600
It raises the calcium content by up to 400% increases,

48
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:55.430
the protein quality improves the amino acid balance and releases niacin from

49
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.470
niacytin it's natural form,

50
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.570
which is bound up and otherwise unavailable to our bodies. Finally,

51
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.470
it makes the greens easier to grind and transforms the flavor,

52
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.920
aroma and texture. Ms.

53
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.350
[inaudible] maze produces miss Tamo and grinding.

54
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.860
This tamale produces a dough known as Masa from Masa.

55
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.330
A number of different traditional foods can be made such as tortillas tamales,

56
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.800
and even the drink known as a totally when made properly using

57
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:28.630
traditional processing. These foods are incredibly nourishing today,

58
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.880
mazes in almost every process food,

59
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.180
and it's a staple for people around the world. However,

60
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.770
in modern food processing,

61
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.270
the crucial Ms. Thomas realization process is almost always skipped over

62
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.560
outside of areas with ancient ties to maize production. In fact,

63
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.820
many food producers likely don't even know it's a possibility when this Thom

64
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.870
realization is skipped,

65
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.400
much of the mazes nutrition remains locked up and inaccessible to our bodies.

66
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.390
No matter how we cook it. When we eat maize like this,

67
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.360
we're literally passing nutrients from our food,

68
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.550
through our bodies and into our waste.

69
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.913
<v 1>Uh.</v>

70
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.750
<v 0>This widespread absence of niche,</v>

71
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.860
Thom realization in maize processing has even led to more serious problems

72
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:14.820
across the globe.

73
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.140
There is a disease called palabra caused by a deficiency of niacin in the diet

74
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.520
that produces symptoms such as red, scaly skin, diarrhea,

75
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.010
dementia, and in advanced stages,

76
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.890
even death over the past several hundred years,

77
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.870
as maze has spread around the world,

78
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.250
this disease has followed in its wake because maze is incredibly cheap and

79
00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:40.050
filling it regularly dominates diets often to the exclusion of other food and

80
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:44.400
essential nutrients cultures that become over-relying on maize maze that has not

81
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:49.140
been [inaudible] do not have access to all of the nutrition that it contains as

82
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:49.680
a result,

83
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.940
millions of people around the world ate massive quantities of maze became

84
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:58.530
deficient in niacin and palabra ran rampant. Just think about how crazy that is.

85
00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:02.100
People around the world are getting sick and dying from a nice inefficiency

86
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.190
while eating large amounts of a food that contains an ice.

87
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.370
While this might not be a big concern for you in your area.

88
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.390
There are still places that rely heavily on Mays experiencing this problem.

89
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.110
In the early 20th century, millions of Americans got palabra,

90
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.900
which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands.

91
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.680
When we realized what the problem actually was instead of adopting the practice

92
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:23.760
of [inaudible]. We made the decision to artificially enriched

93
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.760
 foods with niacin. When we artificially enrich our food, we're addressing one symptom, but we're missing the much larger underlying problem. Yes, it provides us with niacin, but we miss out on all the other benefits of 

94
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.760
[inaudible]

95
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.760
. And just as importantly, we miss out on the opportunity to connect with a

96
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.593
 traditional practice that has such incredible cultural stigma.

97
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.350
The demand of an ever-increasing population scientists are developing things

98
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:59.750
like new insecticides and genetic modifications to increase maize production,

99
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.180
but before taking such drastic measures,

100
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.250
I wonder if we shouldn't first do everything that we can to make the most of the

101
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.510
maze that we're already growing and harvesting since maze is the most widely

102
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:12.440
grown grain in the world.

103
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.180
Just think about the impact that [inaudible] every single kernel of it

104
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.530
would have on our food supply.

105
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.830
There are choices that you can make and things that you can do to make a

106
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.490
difference, make a statement with your paycheck and support small tortilla,

107
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.090
RIAs,

108
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.500
and local food producers who are doing everything possible to produce safe,

109
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.280
nourishing food. Remember tortillas contain one ingredient.

110
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.170
[inaudible] mates refuse to purchase tortillas that contain dozens of

111
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:44.060
ingredients or better yet [inaudible] maze and make tortillas from scratch in

112
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:46.130
your own kitchen. For millions of years,

113
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.330
our ancestors developed technologies and approaches to food to make it safe,

114
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.190
nutrient dense and bioavailable,

115
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.180
but most modern food processing does the exact opposite today.

116
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.340
For the first time in the history of the world,

117
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.240
we can create obesity and malnutrition in the same individual.

118
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.220
That means the process food that we're eating is so free of nutrients that

119
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:10.670
we can eat. Massive quantities of it, and still be malnourished.

120
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.650
This isn't just happening with maze.

121
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.790
It's happening in different ways throughout our food system. This is a problem.

122
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.110
We don't need new food innovations to solve early maize farmers solved this

123
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:22.550
problem. Thousands of years ago,

124
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.290
what we need to do is look to the past and incorporate those traditional

125
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:29.810
practices into our modern food system.
