00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.830
<v 0>Hello, my name is Harrison Lee.</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.460
I'm a professional competitive viewer and three time Canadian national yo-yo

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:06.450
champion. Today.

4
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:10.110
I've been challenged to demonstrate yo-yo tricks in 26 levels of increasing

5
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:10.944
complexity.

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.960
Today, we'll be focusing on yo-yo tricks using an unresponsive yo-yo.

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.770
That means we'll not be going into tricks that use multiple yo-yos or yo-yos

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.880
echo off the string. This is an endless journey into yo-yoing yo-yo tricks,

9
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:33.770
continuously evolve and transform.

10
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:38.030
It's very similar to a hip hop dance where dancers will start with some

11
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:40.880
fundamentals and then build up into their own combinations.

12
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.520
This is my interpretation of the challenge.

13
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.180
Complexity is defined as additional movements,

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.300
additional elements that are combined in these tricks and layers and precision

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.220
and control required. So there are two main different categories of viewing.

16
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.610
There's a response of your use and unresponsive you use for the first few

17
00:00:58.611 --> 00:00:59.060
levels.

18
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.680
We're going to start with a responsive view level one downward sleeper.

19
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.520
So the downward sleeper is the first trick that everybody learns when they start

20
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:10.970
to you. It's a simple list trick, and it involves throwing the yo-yo down,

21
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.490
letting it spin for a bit at the very end or sleep,

22
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.430
and then bringing it back up. So to begin this trick,

23
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.940
you start with your arm based out and a muscle formation,

24
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.730
and then you extend your arm and then flick your wrist. At the very end.

25
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.100
The flick of the wrist at the very end is super,

26
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:29.180
super important because that's what allows it to give the yo-yo the most spin.

27
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.760
So it's very similar to, you know, tennis or badminton,

28
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.520
right at the very end when you hit and flick your wrist,

29
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:36.740
that's where you get the most power. If you don't do that,

30
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:39.710
the yo-yo doesn't have enough spin other than unfortunately,

31
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.380
it'll spin out and die at the end. Um,

32
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.930
and you're sad moving into the next level.

33
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.770
We'll be building off of the downward sleeper and adding an additional element

34
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.060
that will propel the yo-yo forward level to walk the dog

35
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.650
super common trick.

36
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.760
It's the first trick that people will ask you to do when they know that you can

37
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.790
go, you walk, the dog begins by throwing the yo-yo down in a downward sleeper.

38
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.600
You then rest of the yo-yo on the floor, forcing it to propel forward,

39
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.540
or you walk the dog. And then at the very end,

40
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.030
you give it a little tug and the yo-yo returns to you.

41
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.580
When you're trying to walk the dog for the first time,

42
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.250
sometimes you might not have enough spin on the yo-yo.

43
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.420
So when it hits the floor,

44
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.720
the yo-yo will immediately start spinning because of the additional amount of

45
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:21.230
friction.

46
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.490
So a lot of professional users will avoid this strict simply because how

47
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.290
expensive these yo-yos can cost.

48
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.910
And so when somebody asks you to do walk the dog with your $500 titanium yo-yo

49
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.190
you were as cringed for a bit and think,

50
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.320
do I really want to damage the weight distribution and may you and mess it all

51
00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:40.880
up, going into the next level.

52
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:44.630
We're going to be adding a few additional elements to make the tricks a lot more

53
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.480
showy, level three around the world,

54
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.080
around the world starts in a forward pass.

55
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.110
And then instead of it returning to you, the yo-yo returning to you,

56
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.310
you do a full rotation,

57
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.130
or you let the yo-yo move around the world and you rotate the OU with your hand,

58
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.410
almost like you're swinging it in the spiral motion.

59
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.570
And then you return the glue back to your hand.

60
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.010
When you're doing around the world,

61
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.160
it's important that you follow through with your revolution. If you don't,

62
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.350
you have the chance of hitting yourself in the head,

63
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.170
we're going to be introducing amount to the next level,

64
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.610
which will increase the complexity and the number of moving parts going on level

65
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.730
four, rock the baby. So right, the baby,

66
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.380
like the name suggests and involves creating a cradle Mount and then rocking the

67
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:29.560
U U back multiple times, generally a solid rock.

68
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:31.810
The baby involves three full swings,

69
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.560
and then you drop the yo-yo or you drop the baby out of the Mount,

70
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.420
and then you bring the yo-yo back up.

71
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.270
And it's important that you stop between rocks,

72
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.110
that you're not moving the yo-yo back and forth too quickly so that you remain

73
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:44.944
in control.

74
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.370
And the next level things get a little bit more complex because we're going to

75
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:52.560
let the yo-yo leave our hand level five skyrocket

76
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.160
the sky rocket begins in a downward through you,

77
00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:57.660
let the yo-yo sleep at the very end.

78
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.890
And then you let the yo-yo string and the Slipknot off your hand and throw the

79
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:05.580
yo-yo up in the air as a yo-yo is midway in the air. It rules back up,

80
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.340
and then as, as it's falling down, you catch it in your hands.

81
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.680
So when you're learning skyrocket for the first time,

82
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:14.640
it's really important that after you let you go off your hand and throw it up in

83
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:17.040
the air, you have your eye on the prize, ready to catch it.

84
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.810
If you don't do that, unfortunately,

85
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:22.920
the yo-yo will fall on the floor and you'll dent your $500 titanium. Yo-yo.

86
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.470
Now that things are getting a little bit more complex,

87
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:28.170
it's time to switch to an unresponsive view.

88
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.220
So the unresponsive yo-yo is going to be harder because you can't bring an

89
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.730
unresponsive view back up. You have to purposefully not the yoyo,

90
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.100
which will be doubling into the next level.

91
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.140
Level six bind is how you return an unresponsive

92
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:46.290
view. So it's a matter of purposefully nodding, the yo-yo,

93
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.900
which contacts the friction surface on either side,

94
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.520
forcing the yo-yo to come back up.

95
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.430
This is the first unresponsive yo-yo trick that people learn,

96
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:57.030
because you need to learn how to bring the yo-yo back up. Otherwise,

97
00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:00.420
you're going to spend a lot of time winding it back up manually.

98
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.930
So you begin in a downward sleeper, like our first strict that we learned,

99
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.120
but instead of taking the yo-yo back up,

100
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.260
you rest your index finger on the front of the yo-yo string.

101
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.700
You wrap around,

102
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.170
you hit the yo-yo and then cross the strings and then give it a little tug to

103
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:18.150
bring it back up. When you give it a little tug,

104
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.660
you'll have a loop of string that will fall into the gap of the yo-yo.

105
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.440
This will contact the friction surface, causing the OU to spin back up.

106
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.820
So the most important thing to remember is control, and to also have a really,

107
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:32.640
really good through, because if you don't throw the yo-yo hard enough,

108
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.040
it won't spin for a long enough time at the very end.

109
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.820
And you'll not have enough time to wrap the yo-yo string around it to bring it

110
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.490
back up. So in a nurse, once a viewing,

111
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.210
there are three main styles of yo-yo tricks.

112
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.050
So you have your front style through,

113
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.080
which is where you're throwing the yo-yo down right in front of you.

114
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.880
You have your side style through,

115
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.640
which is where you're throwing the you're off to the side.

116
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.090
And then finally a horizontally through where the yo-yo spins off.

117
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.520
All the tricks that we seen in the past six levels have used a Ford through the

118
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:05.930
next we'll be using a side style through level seven trapeze.

119
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.780
So the trap B starts in a breakaway through,

120
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.880
instead of throwing the yo-yo in front of you,

121
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.180
you make a muscle formation off to the side, you extend your arm,

122
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.780
flick your wrist, just the same and you land on a trapeze.

123
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:20.990
So the yo-yo in this case is the man and the string is a trapeze.

124
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.810
So as the yo-yo is coming through through that breakaway,

125
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.960
you flick the yo-yo onto your index string,

126
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.000
and it lands in a formation or a Mount called the trapeze as the yo-yo is coming

127
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:32.390
through.

128
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.290
It's important that you land the yo-yo on the trapeze when beginners are

129
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.390
learning in this trick, the yo-yo will fall off.

130
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.070
And so you kill the man on the trapeze lovable eight brain twister.

131
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.040
So the brain twister is a super impressive trick,

132
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.250
especially when you're starting to learn how to yo-yo and involves throwing the

133
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.740
yo-yo down in a downward sleeper, right in front of you.

134
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.490
And very similar to the bind where you go in front of the yo-yo this time you'll

135
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:56.540
want to go behind.

136
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.980
And so you Mount the yo-yo from behind and you have one longer string and

137
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:03.950
statement one shorter string segment, and he pushed the oo into you.

138
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.630
You force the yo-yo to rotate,

139
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:08.810
and you want to do that three times very similar to rocking the baby.

140
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.990
You let the string, same it go, and then bring the yo-yo back up.

141
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.740
So the next level things are going to get a little bit more complex because

142
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:19.310
we're going to be combining two tricks that we've seen before the trap peas and

143
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:23.180
the brain twister level nine skin, the juror bowl. So skin,

144
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:26.780
the dribble funny name begins in a trapeze,

145
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.000
and then you double Mount the trapeze on.

146
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:32.120
So there's two loops around your index finger on your non through hand,

147
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.320
you unloop the yo-yo and then you Mount the yo-yo on your opposite index finger.

148
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.970
You unmount, you do a brain twister like motion, you dismount from the trapeze,

149
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.100
and then you bring in the, you,

150
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.190
you backup for this trick in particular control is especially important.

151
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.640
You want to make sure that you're landing the OU on the string and dismounting

152
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:50.474
it correctly.

153
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.740
Sometimes you make Bumble and the yo-yo might not land on the string correctly.

154
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:58.700
And so that precision is super important because the yo-yo tricky is longer as

155
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.240
well. It's important that you have a really good spin at the start.

156
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.750
Otherwise the yo-yo may die or start spitting midway through.

157
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.030
So now we're moving onto the next level,

158
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.010
which could be considered our first mini combo level 10,

159
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.480
Mach five Sumach five. It begins in a florid through,

160
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.880
and you start in a split bottom Mount,

161
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.380
you do a barrel rule and then isolate the yo-yo in the center of the string.

162
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.530
And you rotate your index fingers around the yo-yo.

163
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:30.070
So it looks like the yo-yo is stationary while you're moving around it.

164
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.710
And it's very similar to, you know, contact juggling,

165
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.970
where the object is staying in one position, and you're manipulating around it.

166
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.470
After you do three full rotations or three Mach five revolutions,

167
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.040
you dismount and you bring the yo-yo back backup by doing a simple bind

168
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.020
districts requires a lot,

169
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:50.650
a lot of control to keep the yo-yo in that single space.

170
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.500
As you're rotating around it, you don't want to rotate too quickly,

171
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.570
but you also don't want to rotate slowly because you're putting so much pressure

172
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.300
on the yo-yo to maintain it in one space,

173
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.030
the yo-yo may spin off access and gyrus group.

174
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.830
The key to maintaining that control is by pulling your index fingers away from

175
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:11.250
the yo-yo so that it forces it to stay in that one position.

176
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.840
And then when you're doing your rotations,

177
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:14.790
you want to rotate at a constant motion.

178
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.250
So that Dao doesn't start spinning midway through.

179
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.460
The next trick is going to involve a hop element,

180
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.460
which is unlike any other trick that we see seen so far today, level 11,

181
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.540
Eli hop,

182
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.700
the ELA hop starts in a breakaway through you Mount the yo-yo in a trapeze.

183
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.970
And then by bringing your hands together really quickly,

184
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.810
the yo-yo Springs up and launches off to the side.

185
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.790
You then land the yo-yo back on the trapeze. And that performs one, Eli hop.

186
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.360
The Eli hop is super impressive because it's so unexpected.

187
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.850
The yo-yo is stationary and a trapeze,

188
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.940
and then suddenly it Springs off to the side and hops out,

189
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.740
and then you land it back on the trapeze.

190
00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:57.830
So it's very unpredictable and there's so many different variations of the trip

191
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.730
to where you can do some Eli hops, which are much larger and amplitude.

192
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.080
Some which are much smaller.

193
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.880
And you can combine various Eli hops together to create a combo leveled 12.

194
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.600
[inaudible] like the ones that we've seen before with the mock-ups,

195
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.750
the boogie boogie begins and a downward through.

196
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.340
And then you Mount the yo-yo and the 1.5 Mount, you do a single barrel roll.

197
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.720
And then you have the yo-yo between your two index fingers and you pop the yo-yo

198
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:26.930
back and forth between each string, say mint causing it to burn.

199
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.350
You're going back and forth. You want to do that a handful of times,

200
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.640
you then dismount the yo-yo and you return it with a bind when learning a boy

201
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.750
for the first time, it's really easy for the yo-yo to fall off the string,

202
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.760
mid boy, you're doing your Boonie boiling,

203
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.540
and then the yo-yo will pop up the string and then you have to restart.

204
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.410
So it's important that you have that control the bounce of yo-yo back and forth

205
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.610
between those two strings.

206
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.120
And you have a clear eye on where the yo-yo is at every given motion.

207
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.600
So the additional complexity that we'll be introducing in the next trick, yeah.

208
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.970
Involves a Slack element level 13 revolutions revolutions is a

209
00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:05.090
repeater. A repeater that we've seen before was the Mach five.

210
00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:08.540
And very similarly at the Eli hop or the rock, the baby,

211
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.750
were you doing a moment repetitively, but with the revolutions,

212
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.040
you're manipulating a Slack element. So you begin in a split bottom Mount.

213
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.810
And when you're in that split bottom Mount,

214
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.950
you pinch the string with your index finger and your thumb causing the yo-yo

215
00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:22.790
string to Slack.

216
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.780
You then rotate the yo-yo string inwards and outwards from your hand causing the

217
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.710
yo-yo string to fold the, you, as you spin to do the air,

218
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.550
it's almost like waving a fan after you've repeated it. A handful of times,

219
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.330
you dismount from the Mount and you bring the video back up with the revolution,

220
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:39.680
very similar to the Mach five.

221
00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:43.070
It's really important that you maintain your momentum as you're doing each of

222
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:43.904
those revolutions,

223
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.840
have you started spinning the yo-yo midway through the yo-yo Slack formation

224
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.780
will break, and then you'll have to repeat it again.

225
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.920
Level 14 Brent store.

226
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.540
So the Bryn stall involves a new kind of element called the laceration.

227
00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.620
So with the laceration,

228
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:03.880
you pop the yo-yo up into the air and he create a Slack movement underneath the

229
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.080
yo-yo and create a formation so that when the yo-yo falls back onto the string,

230
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.840
it falls into that formation or into that Mount.

231
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.390
So with the Brent stall in particular,

232
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.770
the yo-yo falls into a triangle like formation or triangle like Mount.

233
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.270
One of the common mistakes when players learn Brent stole for the first time is

234
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:25.810
not slacking the yo-yo underneath the string enough to create a large enough

235
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.280
loop to create that triangle formation, the yo-yo to land back onto the string.

236
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.880
So the next level is also a repeater and it involves the Slack element.

237
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.790
And you rotate around your non index through hand and level of 15

238
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.200
Yuki Slack.

239
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.880
So you begin in an F side style through and start in a trapeze.

240
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.560
You then pinch your index finger and your thumb of your non through head of the

241
00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:53.310
string by rotating it with a clockwise motion and capsule string,

242
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:54.750
same in a double or nothing,

243
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.780
even dismount from that double or nothing off to the side,

244
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.390
hit the yo-yo on the bottom of the string and Slack.

245
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.070
The yo-yo in the opposite direction.

246
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.440
You catch a string semen as it's going around,

247
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.110
and then you repeat the motion again. So you dismount,

248
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.650
you hop onto the string on your trapeze and he slapped it over into a double or

249
00:13:10.651 --> 00:13:12.720
nothing back and forth, back and forth.

250
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.240
After you've done your fair share of Yuki slacks,

251
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.850
you dismount and you bring you back up.

252
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.080
So when difficulty with the Yuki Slack is that the trick can fall apart on

253
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.100
success of repeats. As you're slacking the yo-yo back and forth, back and forth.

254
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.630
It's really easy for the string and the yo-yo to get tangled up and resulting in

255
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.820
a dead yo-yo and a non in your hands level 16 black ops

256
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.080
black hops requires a lot of precision and a lot of control.

257
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.000
You begin in a triple or nothing Mount,

258
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.980
which is very similar to the double or nothing,

259
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.830
but you rotate the yo-yo around the string one more time.

260
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.740
So that there's three strings St. Mints on either index finger.

261
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.270
When you're in that triple or nothing,

262
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:56.250
you then bounce you off the string consecutively until you reach a trapeze.

263
00:13:56.251 --> 00:13:59.310
So you're constantly bouncing the area back up, landing on the string,

264
00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:01.980
bouncing dealio, back up, letting it on the string.

265
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.490
And then you land in that trap. Ease. Once you're out in the trapeze,

266
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.280
you want to build back up to a triple or nothing.

267
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.150
So you hop the yo-yo back up slash two off to the side at land,

268
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.540
in a truckies, and his brother jumped the yo-yo back up,

269
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.340
it lands in a double or nothing,

270
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.740
and you continue and totally you're in a triple or nothing.

271
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.170
Once you're in that triple or nothing. Again,

272
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.190
you drop all the string statements. So it's just resting on your index finger,

273
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.610
you dismount, and you do it by and to bring the AAO back up.

274
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.940
So with black-ops precision and control are your best friend.

275
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.880
You really want to make sure that you have an eye on the yo-yo as it's hopping

276
00:14:35.881 --> 00:14:39.270
between the strings and you're landing on each string, same mint,

277
00:14:39.271 --> 00:14:42.840
clearly when you're going down to the trapeze and when you're moving back up,

278
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.990
very similarly, you're landing on each string. Same minute clearly.

279
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.920
So the next trick we're going to make the yo-yo look like it's skipping rope

280
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.540
level 17 follows the trick, begins in a trapeze,

281
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.650
like many other tricks.

282
00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.880
And you dismount you then slash are you with a karate chop,

283
00:15:00.881 --> 00:15:05.050
like motion that creates a loop around your through hand,

284
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.840
and then you rotate it around the yoga multiple times,

285
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:12.430
kind of like skipping rope after you're done rotating around the yo-yo a handful

286
00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:15.880
of times you land the yo-yo in iron whip,

287
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.370
which is where the yo-yo trick originated from.

288
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.540
And then you bring the yo-yo back up through a bind, like the Yuki Slack,

289
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.100
like the revolution, like the Mach five, the follows is a repeater.

290
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.390
What this trick momentum is super, super important. After you start the trick,

291
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.010
you have to keep following through otherwise the yo-yo and the string and the

292
00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:38.560
Slack will get tangled up for the next trick.

293
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.140
We're going to be incorporating another part of our body.

294
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.160
And the yo-yo is skin aligned behind our back level,

295
00:15:45.161 --> 00:15:47.230
18 leg wrap trap.

296
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.870
So the Lake rap trap begins in a brick way through you do a handful of around

297
00:15:52.871 --> 00:15:56.320
the world, and then you step over the string with your right leg,

298
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.480
and then shortly after with your left leg.

299
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.870
And then afterwards you land in a trapeze behind your back,

300
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.600
you quickly dismount and bring the yo-yo back up to your hand.

301
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.760
So this yo-yo trick is also commonly known as the ball breaker because the

302
00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:13.420
yo-yo string is going between your legs and can break your bowls.

303
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.430
Lots of mistakes to be made with the stricken.

304
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.950
The next trick is another laceration and involves wrapping the yo-yo string

305
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.720
around the yo-yo and nut time.

306
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.020
So you land in a 2.5 minutes level,

307
00:16:26.021 --> 00:16:28.570
19 2.5 hook.

308
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.760
So the 2.5 hook like the triangle laceration involves popping the yo-yo up and

309
00:16:33.761 --> 00:16:38.110
spinning you your string around the yo-yo multiple times to land the yo-yo back

310
00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:42.610
into a Mount when it falls back down. And this case it's a 2.5 Mount,

311
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.290
which is like the one and a half mounds,

312
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.650
but with two and a half strings wrapped around the yo-yo instead.

313
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:52.930
So the yo-yo begins in a brick way through you pop the yo-yo up as the yo-yo is

314
00:16:52.931 --> 00:16:54.100
midway through the air.

315
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.450
You take your two index fingers and you're wrapping around the string multiple

316
00:16:58.451 --> 00:16:58.990
times,

317
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.970
two and a half times be exact as the yo-yo is falling back into the string.

318
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.960
You land in that 2.5 mountains. So this trick is really challenging,

319
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.840
cause it's quite risky. You either get it or you don't.

320
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.650
You have to try multiple times and it can be quite tiring to pop the yo-yo back

321
00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:18.370
up, spin around with your index fingers and then land back onto the string.

322
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.820
So with the strict, because you're rotating around the UL multiple times,

323
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.890
it's common to not catch the string when it lands in the two plate five Mount.

324
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.180
So up to this point,

325
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.090
we've looked at the front style through and the breakaway through,

326
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.000
but we'll be introducing a new throw in this upcoming trick,

327
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.950
the horses or through level 20 banana turnover and horizontal pinwheel.

328
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.030
So the banana turnover and the horizontal pin wheel are two sides of the same

329
00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:46.840
coin. They're just different based off of the way that you begin with the throw.

330
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.790
So in the case of the banana turnover, and it's more of a side silo throw,

331
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.340
but horizontal and with the horizontal pinwheel,

332
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.580
it's like a downward forward facing through, but horizontal.

333
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.990
So beginning with banana turnover, you begin an aside style through,

334
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.290
but instead horizontal. So kind of like you're throwing a Frisbee.

335
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.870
And then as the yo-yo is going around,

336
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.570
almost like you're about to hit in the trapeze.

337
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.590
You stick out your thumb facing downwards of your non through hand,

338
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.160
and the yoyo will wrap around your thumb, causing it to rotate.

339
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.750
You do that a couple of times,

340
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.160
and that rebalances the plane of the yo-yo so that you can land it in a trapeze.

341
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.520
After you're in that trapeze, you can do a variety of different tricks.

342
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.240
Ben and turnover is a starting point to many horizontal tricks.

343
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.390
And then you bring it back up with the horizontal Penwell you're throwing the

344
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.530
yo-yo across your body.

345
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.260
And as the yo-yo is fully extended at the end of the string,

346
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.080
you're doing a series of pinwheels to keep it in the same plane,

347
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.450
very similar to the banana turnover. After that,

348
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:45.840
you can transition into a horizontal combo and then bring the yo-yo up with a

349
00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:46.560
bind.

350
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.160
Horizontal tricks are a lot more challenging than your typical sod style or

351
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:53.640
front style throw because you have to keep the yo-yo spinning.

352
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.060
Otherwise it'll spin out a plane level 21,

353
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.290
the UFO is a horizontal trick and he began by doing a banana turnover

354
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.610
as a yo-yo spinning around your thumb. You let it rest for a second,

355
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.330
almost allowing it to spin out and spin out of control.

356
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.500
But before it starts spinning, you popped the yo-yo up and you catch the,

357
00:19:15.501 --> 00:19:17.240
are you returning it in a bind?

358
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.710
And it's called the UFO because it looks like a UFO is about to land.

359
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.570
The yo-yo is flat when you're performing the trick flat on the horizontal

360
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:30.590
plane and the yo-yo string spirals around it, because it's about to die.

361
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.161
You know,

362
00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:33.980
you've done the strict correctly because the yo-yo will look like it's hovering

363
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.790
midway through the air. So the UFO is all about timing and it's about timing.

364
00:19:37.791 --> 00:19:40.460
The amount of spin left in the yo-yo before you return it,

365
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.360
but you also wanted to let it spin out for a couple of rotations so that you can

366
00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:48.140
get that cool hovering effect in that process. The yo-yo may spin out.

367
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.850
I control the humid day in between where you may not catch the

368
00:19:52.851 --> 00:19:56.660
you as you pop it up. We're at a really advanced level now.

369
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.680
And for the next trick,

370
00:19:57.681 --> 00:20:02.450
we're going to add a little bit of complexity by involving our neck level 22,

371
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.740
the Zack Gorham lead neck trick and involves starting human trapeze,

372
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.700
dismounting, bringing the yo-yo string above your head and above your neck,

373
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.980
wrapping the shrinks.

374
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.220
So it lands in a chopstick with your index finger and your thumb of your throw

375
00:20:16.221 --> 00:20:19.130
hand pulling apart, almost like you're doing a revolution,

376
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.600
extending the yo-yo above and over your head crunching down so that the Slack

377
00:20:23.601 --> 00:20:26.690
follows you dismounting and bringing the yo-yo back-up.

378
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.690
So this trick involves a lot of the levels that we've seen before,

379
00:20:29.691 --> 00:20:34.310
including the trap PS, the revolution and the Slack.

380
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.950
So with Zack grumbly and metric, at one point,

381
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.470
you're not able to see the yo-yo because it's above your head.

382
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.340
So you need to make sure that you're extending far enough over so you don't

383
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.600
accidentally hit yourself.

384
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.600
So the next trick is the last of our non combo tricks and involves

385
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:54.100
spinning the yo-yo on your finger level 23 finger spin

386
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:54.970
Sidewinder.

387
00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.780
So the finger spin Sidewinder begins and a horizontal pin wheel through after

388
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.740
you pinwheel a handful of times,

389
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.810
you pop the yo-yo up and land on your index finger of your non throw

390
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:09.880
hand. Oh, spin there for a couple of moments.

391
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.970
And after the U is about to dive very similar to the UFO.

392
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.640
You lacerate into the center of the string,

393
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.710
causing the yo-yo to bind as the O is binding you hover your throw hand on

394
00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:24.040
top of the yo-yo causing the yo-yo to do a Sidewinder movement,

395
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.770
causing you to return back to your hand.

396
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.880
It's really important that you keep in mind the timing, very similar to the UFO.

397
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.770
When you landed on your finger,

398
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.890
the audio will spin out really quickly because of the additional amount of

399
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:40.510
friction. And initially, after you returned the yo-yo back up to your hand,

400
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.340
it'll mess up the string tension.

401
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.250
So the Slack and the string will be all in place.

402
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.830
So it'll be really difficult to do subsequent tricks.

403
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.450
If you decide to do a finger spin and Sidewinder during the middle of a routine.

404
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.040
So the next couple of tricks are combinations that I've created myself level

405
00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.560
24, the Eli hop combo.

406
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.640
So in a competition, you, yours will often perform an Eli hop combo.

407
00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.960
So an Eli hub combo involves the trick that we saw before the ELA hop.

408
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.140
It's a matter of doing different variations of that same trick in different

409
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:17.050
directions, in different sizes, in different planes.

410
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.490
So my take on the Eli hot Pombo begins and the reverse Brent stool,

411
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.820
I popped the yo-yo off to the side, my right hand side.

412
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.480
I then pop it in the opposite direction to the left-hand side of my body.

413
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:33.550
I then do a series of pop elements and then the yo-yo and a reverse

414
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.150
hook.

415
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.830
I then do reverse behind the elbow double or nothing.

416
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.620
I dismount very similar to a black hop.

417
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.730
I land the yo-yo string inverted in an inverted trapeze.

418
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.890
And then I return the yo-yo back to my hand.

419
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.390
So this Eli hop combo is something that I've been working on from 2017.

420
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.110
And I've been continuously adding new elements and new tricks as I've learned

421
00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.400
that level 25 neck behind the back leg.

422
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:03.810
<v 2>Okay?</v>

423
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.740
<v 0>So the neck behind the back leg combo involves three body parts, your neck,</v>

424
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.100
your leg, of course, and then doing tricks behind your back.

425
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.150
So you start in a Yuki Slack like movement. And as a result,

426
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.260
you go around your neck,

427
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.440
wrapping around your neck and when you unravel your unravel.

428
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.980
So the yo-yo is landing behind your back. When the yo-yo is behind your back,

429
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:28.260
you do a pop like motion returning you back to a trapeze in front of your

430
00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:30.480
body, invert yo-yo string.

431
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.170
And you go underneath your non through hand leg.

432
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.790
So it catches underneath after you catch the, your string underneath your leg.

433
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.400
So that it's, the yo-yo is hanging underneath your leg,

434
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.280
but you do a series of pop movements and then eventually pop the Bacco

435
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.240
back to a trapeze. You do a series of laceration like elements,

436
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.240
and then landed an amount to return the yo-yo back to your hand.

437
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.770
So a lot of things can go wrong with this trick simply because of the number of

438
00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.390
different body parts involved,

439
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.510
the number of different elements and the number of transitions that you have to

440
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:04.970
make between each of those main components.

441
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:07.700
So behind the back around the neck and around the leg,

442
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.780
when you're trying to unravel the yo-yo string around the neck,

443
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.710
so that it lands behind your back, Oh, unravel in the wrong direction,

444
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.100
causing you to have a yo-yo just wrapped around your body.

445
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:23.060
Ultimately the possibility for combinations are endless.

446
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.650
All those tricks that you've seen,

447
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:29.060
all those levels can be combined in various different ways to create various

448
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.560
combos in a competition. Players will take their own tricks,

449
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.740
take their own combos and create a freestyle routine.

450
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.640
Freestyle yo-yoing is arguably the most difficult because it combines various

451
00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:45.380
elements, tricks, and combinations into a single routine level 26.

452
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.640
Freestyle freestyling is when you just let the universe do its thing,

453
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.210
you do the first string that comes to your mind. And then from that trick,

454
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.340
you transition into the net trick, really,

455
00:24:55.341 --> 00:24:58.850
wherever your hands take you freestyling is about making decisions in the

456
00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:02.480
moment. It's more of an intuition thing where you're just transitioning between

457
00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:06.500
elements, transitioning between mounts, so that you're creating various combos.

458
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.710
As you go. It's a matter of then taking the restricts,

459
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.740
matching districts to music, playing around with the pacing,

460
00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:15.950
playing around with, you know, body elements, playing around with tricks,

461
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:18.830
which was smaller and technical, and really going with the song.

462
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.370
And the moment sometimes the decisions may lead to a knot.

463
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.610
Sometimes those decisions may lead to a fantastic trick.

464
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.910
It's really about messing around and seeing you at work, seeing what doesn't.

465
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.450
And that's one of the fun parts about yo-yoing because there's so many limitless

466
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:34.700
possibilities. Thanks, wired.
