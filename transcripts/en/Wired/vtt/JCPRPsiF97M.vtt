00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>At Jedi master Ray asks,</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.030
if you could meet one character from the star Wars universe and ask them one

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:09.510
question, who would you pick and what would you ask?

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.970
I think I would go with Bray, honestly,

5
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.330
just because I want to know if she's happy. I want to know if she's doing okay.

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.370
<v 1>I mean, I would have to go with my favorite character ever. Big stark lighter.</v>

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.020
I would ask him how he made such a glorious

8
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:28.340
mustache. It's something that I just did for the first time. I grew my,

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.750
my very first mustache and it was itchy. I didn't really care for it.

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.100
I want to know, uh, how he felt about his mustache. Hi, I'm Alex Damon.

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.130
<v 0>And I'm Molly Damon. And this is star Wars support.</v>

12
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.910
<v 1>At Andy Keach asks,</v>

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.840
when did it become bad for Mandalorians to remove their helmets in front of

14
00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:54.290
people? Jango Fett is often without his helmet and in the clone Wars,

15
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.940
you see Mandalorians without them.

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.010
This was pretty definitively answered in chapter 11 of the

17
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.650
Mandalorian, where we see Boca tan.

18
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:06.980
One of those Mandalorians from the clone Wars, she shows up,

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.330
she takes her helmet off our Mandalorian. The hero of the show is all a gassed.

20
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.120
Uh, and, and we learned that he has been raised in basically a cult of, uh,

21
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.710
the Mandalorian people.

22
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.880
I assume the children of the watches related to death watch because we saw den

23
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:26.450
get rescued by members of death, watch in season one.

24
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.830
<v 0>Kind of an extremist version of Mandalore culture.</v>

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.050
<v 1>Exactly that, uh, so it's okay for most Mandalorians to take their helmets off.</v>

26
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:40.070
It's just that this one sec, the children of the watch, uh,

27
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.180
demand that you leave your helmet on at Sarah underscore Wolf,

28
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.570
maybe something I shouldn't say out loud, it says quick question.

29
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.890
If I want to start watching star Wars, in which order should I watch the movies?

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.570
I'm always a big proponent of just release order. Yeah, we do that.

31
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.280
The reason I think that is because every movie builds on what came before it,

32
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.450
even if they chronologically take place earlier. So yeah,

33
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.190
they're the prequels I think are better viewed having seen the original

34
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.730
trilogy, uh, even small things like rogue.

35
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:17.600
One kind of has a hint for, uh, the last Jedi,

36
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.110
a small little Easter egg that you can catch. And, uh,

37
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.760
everything just does this little story-building thing. Uh,

38
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.330
if you watch it in release or.

39
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.480
<v 0>There's really no wrong way or wrong order to watch the star Wars</v>

40
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:37.370
movies in. But yeah, I think we prefer just release order date.

41
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.390
<v 1>First time viewer, I would say watch them in the order that they were released.</v>

42
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.310
<v 0>Stuart web asks, Oh,</v>

43
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.840
now here's another question for the real star Wars nerds are all the characters

44
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:51.860
that look like humans, the same species that have colonized lots of planets,

45
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.280
or is it a star Trek, parallel evolution thing,

46
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.230
and Han and Leia are different types of aliens. Uh,

47
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.520
I am not familiar.

48
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.200
<v 1>Enough with star Trek, surprise,</v>

49
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.580
surprise to know exactly what the parallel evolution thing is.

50
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.620
I would guess that humans are the same across the

51
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:15.250
board, at least in legends, that correspond was their home world.

52
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.780
And then they spread out.

53
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.300
I think it's probably something similar here that humanity probably had a home

54
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.860
world and then colonized other planets.

55
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.870
<v 0>Yeah. As far as star Wars goes and their species,</v>

56
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.520
a lot of them are just described as human or every once in a while,

57
00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:35.640
for instance, Dryden boss is described as humanoid.

58
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.370
<v 1>Or yeah. Or in mere human even. Uh,</v>

59
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.380
it definitely sounds like maybe sometimes interbreeding has created near

60
00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:45.810
human species, but for the most part,

61
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:48.360
I would say that like Han and Leia are the same.

62
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.290
<v 0>Eric, Michael Garcia says binge watching clone Wars.</v>

63
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:56.370
And I have an important question. Did obiwan know about Anacon and pad may.

64
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.600
<v 1>I think 100% there there's that scene where, um,</v>

65
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.250
Anacon has a hollow call with pad Mae and Rex is kind of guarding the door

66
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.810
because he knows what's going on.

67
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:09.990
And then he's trying to keep [inaudible] out of that room.

68
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.200
And then obiwan later says to Anik and something like,

69
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.290
I hope you at least said hi to Padma for me. Like he.

70
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.930
<v 0>And there's that moment in revenge of the Sith when OB one basically deduces</v>

71
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.800
that pad May's child is aniguns Ken Collins says,

72
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:27.450
I have a question for all the star Wars,

73
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:32.310
legends fans have squadron versus Delta squadron who would win.

74
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.350
<v 1>Delta squadrons were basically Republic commando units.</v>

75
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:41.100
They were very elite squads of clone troopers.

76
00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:45.900
We actually see Delta squadron in the clone Wars episode, which is of the mist.

77
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:49.770
So they are Canon havoc has yet to be mentioned in Canada. As far as I know,

78
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.220
I like Delta squadron more. I had more experience with them.

79
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:56.370
I'm mostly just choosing them over my own connection with them.

80
00:04:56.371 --> 00:05:00.270
I would prefer that they win. Uh, I really liked the Republic commando game.

81
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.770
Yeah, I'll go with Delta squadron.

82
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.810
<v 0>I mean, based off the name alone, I want to pick havoc squadron, a house divided</v>

83
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.030
at tail stakes says star Wars lore question.

84
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.250
The Jedi are a religion, right?

85
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.610
Do you have to be forced sensitive to practice the religion?

86
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.280
If someone is born without force sensitivity,

87
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.320
but still adheres to the teachings,

88
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:26.280
would they be recognized as a non force using Jedi?

89
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.410
<v 1>Again, we don't really know a whole lot about the history of the Jedi, uh,</v>

90
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.620
in legends, there was a whole thing with the throw your,

91
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:37.800
and like basically a bunch of people around the galaxy,

92
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:39.810
like felt the calling of the force in it,

93
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.610
brought them all to this one place where they started, uh, the J dye religion.

94
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.250
And that evolved into the Jedi for Canon.

95
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:51.570
We don't really know how the first Jedi were on Octo.

96
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.290
We don't know if they were all forced sensitive or if they were just trying to

97
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.280
access whatever they were the forest at that time,

98
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:02.840
if they knew there was something to their galaxy that they could tap

99
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.500
into it it's possible that they were all just a bunch of dudes that figured it

100
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.240
out.

101
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.190
<v 0>Yeah. There's that mosaic on Octo of what they called the prime</v>

102
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:17.050
Jedi. But I think that's more of an example of what a prime Jedi is

103
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:19.480
perfectly balanced, yin and yang.

104
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.970
<v 1>There is something called the church of the force,</v>

105
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.840
Laura San Teka and the force awakens was a member of that.

106
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.380
So there are definitely people who believe in the force,

107
00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:33.100
but might not be able to touch it in the same way that the Jedi do.

108
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.300
I would guess that at least the Jedi of the prequel era would not recognize

109
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:42.100
anyone that couldn't use the forest. They are very strict, rule-based rigid.

110
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.820
So I don't think that they would be like, Oh, well, you can't use the forest,

111
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:48.370
but you still want to be one of us, like, come on it. And I don't,

112
00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:51.100
I don't see them trying to nurture anyone in that.

113
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.140
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think they would be considered Jedi in that case.</v>

114
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.090
The first person that came to my mind was Maz Kanata it seems like she

115
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:05.770
has some connection to the forest, but she wouldn't consider herself a Jedi.

116
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.120
Every living being does have some connection to the forest.

117
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.630
It's like whether or not you tap into that.

118
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.760
<v 1>Well, I personally believe that anyone in the star Wars galaxy has the</v>

119
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.780
capability to use the force.

120
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.940
They just need to be taught how, I mean,

121
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:28.480
Luke went from not knowing what it was to blowing up the death star in like a

122
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:32.320
day. I think that it's on purpose that in the prequel era,

123
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.860
we see the Jedi like testing Atkins blood to be like, well,

124
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.790
what's his medical Orien count like, and is it worth it to bring him in?

125
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.170
And I actually think that is like a fault of the Jedi is that they're testing

126
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.320
potential instead of like passion, if someone is like,

127
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:50.320
I want to become a Jedi and it's like, I want to learn this stuff.

128
00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:52.990
And they're like, well, we don't think it's worth the time to train you.

129
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.510
I kind of think that's what the pre-qual era Jedi,

130
00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.640
what George was trying to say with them at Tavenner's CD says it's time to bring

131
00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:03.580
back philosophy Friday with a star Wars twist answer.

132
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:05.890
The question was Luke Skywalker, correct?

133
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:10.120
In his assessment of the Jedi during the last Jedi are the Jedi fundamentally

134
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:12.130
flawed and how they approached the force.

135
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.620
<v 0>His first sort of lesson that he gives to Ray in</v>

136
00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:22.030
the last Jedi is that the forest does not belong to the Jedi.

137
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.070
And he talks about how flawed they were in their teachings

138
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.140
of, yeah, I think that was pretty spot on.

139
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.340
<v 1>I think that the Jedi of the prequel era have lost their way.</v>

140
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:38.140
I absolutely think that that was George Lucas's intent in the prequel trilogy.

141
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:41.830
They were very different from the way many of us imagine them to be when we just

142
00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:43.120
saw the original trilogy.

143
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.320
And then I think he doubled down on that when you get into the clone Wars series

144
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.190
at Rebecca, Brinker's says, quick question for star Wars, fans,

145
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.060
think Vader ever fell asleep at a meeting. This should have been an email.

146
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.130
I mean, he's got the helmet on. So who would know? Yes.

147
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:01.200
I want that to be true very badly. Now.

148
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.710
<v 0>It would depend on his breathing whether or not people would notice,</v>

149
00:09:06.711 --> 00:09:07.544
I guess.

150
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.370
<v 1>Snoring sounds like with that helmet on.</v>

151
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.350
<v 0>I don't know. Yeah.</v>

152
00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:17.330
I guess if he maybe just started to slump over people would be like,

153
00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:18.200
Hey Vader.

154
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.353
<v 3>I'm awake.</v>

155
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.400
<v 0>Trying to think of, of a, an excuse he could give in a situation like this.</v>

156
00:09:25.401 --> 00:09:30.320
Like, Oh, I had a firmware update at rabid.

157
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.820
Solar has a question for any star Wars nerds. That would be us. Uh,

158
00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:39.710
what does an extremely expensive slash precious material in the galaxy far,

159
00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:44.630
far away that would be equivalent to gold or diamonds to us Khyber

160
00:09:44.631 --> 00:09:45.464
best car.

161
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.540
<v 1>Those were the first two that popped into my mind.</v>

162
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.850
<v 0>I think best scar is pretty close because it seems like everyone</v>

163
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.740
Mondo comes across and they realize what his outfit is made out of.

164
00:09:57.741 --> 00:10:00.920
They want to immediately steal it because it's worth a lot of money.

165
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.580
<v 1>Best scar is what Mandalorian armor is made out of. Uh,</v>

166
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.300
it's very durable.

167
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.850
It's nearly blaster proof.

168
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.470
The only thing we've really seen truly destroy best car armor is a mud

169
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:18.470
horn so far. Uh, but yeah,

170
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.150
it's a very precious metal, a rare metal that Mandalorian armor is made out of,

171
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:27.950
but also it can be used as currency Kyber crystals are the crystals that

172
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:32.360
power a jeopardize lightsaber. They were also used to power.

173
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:36.230
The death star is super laser. They are called living crystals.

174
00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:37.850
They have a connection to the force.

175
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.590
They would call out to Jedi and that's how they would find their lightsaber.

176
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:43.220
Crystal.

177
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.690
I would guess that maybe Kyber crystals are even more rare with the Jedi,

178
00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:50.330
not around. I mean, even when the Jedi were around,

179
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:55.070
like lightsabers on the black market were highly prized. So yeah,

180
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.730
I think you hit the nail on the head with both of those.

181
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.440
I know that there are things, uh,

182
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.180
the comics recently brought back in like Ruby sapphires and the same

183
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:08.990
precious gemstones that we have in the real world exist out there. But I mean,

184
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.610
Kyber crystals and best scar still seem to be more rare and valuable

185
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.220
general clinker says sometimes before death,

186
00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:20.120
the separatists battle droids of the star Wars prequels yell. Oh my God.

187
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.570
So that begs the question who introduced them to religion,

188
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.830
where they programmed with religious beliefs and who is the joy to God. Well,

189
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.690
I do think that they have some sort of belief system.

190
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.070
I mean, it might just be something they say, but three PO says, thank the maker.

191
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.611
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

192
00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:42.590
I was going to bring up the idea of the maker and I assume that's just who

193
00:11:42.591 --> 00:11:47.150
created them is, is three PO thanking an akin. In that sense.

194
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.570
<v 1>It might just be kind of a thing that they say like,</v>

195
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.880
thank the person that gave me life,

196
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.700
but there is definitely an argument to be had that droids are sentient.

197
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.970
I mean, L three, three seven, I think proves that. So I,

198
00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:06.700
I don't know that the battle droids we're programmed to

199
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.660
have religion,

200
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:12.040
but I do think that it's possible for them to just develop it on their own

201
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.080
without a constant memory wise.

202
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.410
<v 0>At ITU studio says very important question from ad blockbuster pod.</v>

203
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.290
Is this the first sweater in star Wars?

204
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.950
<v 1>Well, I mean, everyone kind of went nuts for Ben solos,</v>

205
00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:29.790
a good boy sweater and the rise of Skywalker. Very good boy. Uh,

206
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.760
this might be the first fishermen sweater though.

207
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.850
<v 0>Like the first cable knit sweater, I'd say yeah.</v>

208
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.380
<v 1>Off the top of my head. I can't think of anyone on Hoth wearing one. Uh, that,</v>

209
00:12:40.381 --> 00:12:43.110
that feels like the place. You'd see. One Galen air.

210
00:12:43.111 --> 00:12:44.790
So kind of has one on law mew.

211
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.490
<v 0>Did they wear them in the holiday special though? The original one?</v>

212
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:52.740
<v 1>Uh, no, but you, you are right about the, the new Lego one Vader,</v>

213
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.873
whereas a Christmas sweater.

214
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.380
<v 0>Yeah. It's a Lego sweater, but it's still, it's still meant to be a sweater.</v>

215
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.130
<v 1>My question with this Mon calamari sweater, man though,</v>

216
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.050
how does he get it on and off without stretching the neck hole

217
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:10.440
out and not to mention their arms, their forearms are huge.

218
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:14.100
So how do you get like your sleeves on? They would rip that sweater apart.

219
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.880
<v 0>Maybe in the back is just covered in buttons and it's,</v>

220
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.150
they just have to button it up front to back.

221
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.100
<v 1>Hector Roman says Boca tan has been alive since the first six movies and she</v>

222
00:13:26.101 --> 00:13:28.890
still looks good question. How old is she?

223
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.790
Bo Catan is the sister of Duchess sateen.

224
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:38.280
Kreis who used to be in charge of all of Mandalore. She ruled Mandalore space.

225
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.460
She was kind of a controversial leader because she was trying to make

226
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.340
Mandalorians, uh, more pacifist.

227
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:49.350
They used to be hardcore conquers and very aggressive, violent people.

228
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.590
And she was trying to help her people evolve beyond that.

229
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.000
Boca tan was a member of a group called death, watch that opposed the pacifism.

230
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.380
Uh, so Boca tan was actually a Mandalorian terrorist for a while, but, uh,

231
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.780
she has since kind of come around,

232
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.300
she tried to save her sister's life and failed.

233
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:10.050
And since then has been fighting. What I would say is the good fight.

234
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.530
I think there's still some darkness in her. Uh,

235
00:14:13.531 --> 00:14:18.450
and I hope the series continues to explore that my best guess is 50

236
00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:19.530
55.

237
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.600
I would say that she could be like 20 at the very youngest in the clone

238
00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:25.434
Wars.

239
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:30.300
And then you're adding about 30 years onto that for the time of the Mandalorian.

240
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.540
<v 0>We discussed this a little bit, um,</v>

241
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.310
after seeing this amazing episode of the Mandalorian and I decided

242
00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:42.900
that because Mandalorians were helmets most of the time,

243
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.820
she just hadn't, hasn't gotten a lot of sun damage. So yeah, she looks great.

244
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.920
<v 1>John Carl says not a critique,</v>

245
00:14:49.921 --> 00:14:54.320
but a genuine question prior to the Ray trilogy was astral projection ever

246
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:57.230
established in star Wars, either in Canon or legends.

247
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.800
I can't remember seeing it before this trilogy for the life of me.

248
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.510
This book, the Jedi path is technically a legends book,

249
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.350
but page one 32 talks about a power called doppelganger,

250
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.350
which is exactly what Luke does.

251
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.840
And the last Jedi also,

252
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:19.280
you can do it in one of the old dark forces games where you play marriage aid.

253
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:19.910
Uh,

254
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.290
you could make a doppelganger to confuse your enemies and like basically just

255
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.690
have, uh, another copy of you running around fighting.

256
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.170
<v 0>Skier says star Wars question.</v>

257
00:15:29.171 --> 00:15:32.890
Why do they call it an X wing when the end universe standard language,

258
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.290
the letter for X looks like a triangle.

259
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:40.300
<v 1>So yes, our rubbish is the most prominent alphabet within star Wars.</v>

260
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.200
Uh, but it's not the only alphabet there exists a,

261
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.820
I think it's called the high galactic alphabet and that is our own.

262
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.540
So there is an a, a, B, a C and an X in star Wars.

263
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.100
And I guess the, the people that make those ships just preferred that alphabet.

264
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.110
<v 0>Hayes Brown has a question.</v>

265
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.280
How does being strong in the forest run and families, if Jedi in theory,

266
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.100
the most in tune aren't allowed to have family.

267
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.380
<v 1>I think that the Skywalker blood was kind of a specialty.</v>

268
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.600
<v 0>That's definitely how it started. It was a special case. The chosen one. Yeah.</v>

269
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.580
<v 1>He was literally like akin was born of the force. And it seems like, yeah,</v>

270
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.560
any offspring he had and his line would also just be very strong

271
00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:27.394
in the force,

272
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.170
but that is not like a tried and true definite yes.

273
00:16:32.171 --> 00:16:35.020
Every Jedi is going to have a force sensitive child.

274
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.300
If you go back to some legend stuff,

275
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.920
the older public era Revon and [inaudible], uh,

276
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:46.840
they were two very powerful Jedi and they did have

277
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.200
some children who were forced sensitive. But if you go down the line,

278
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.450
their descendants sateen had a son Theron and he was not forced

279
00:16:55.451 --> 00:16:56.284
sensitive at all.

280
00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:01.270
So it's not like a given that a two Jedi or one Jedi are

281
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:03.090
going to have force sensitive children.

282
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.410
<v 0>What a bummer that would be to be the only non for sensitive sibling.</v>

283
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.750
<v 1>Oh, he definitely had like a complex about it.</v>

284
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.600
<v 0>Yeah. Alexander yard says, good morning.</v>

285
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.730
Here's the question for my star Wars geeks.

286
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.290
What's a buck hand was Han solo holding when he won the Falcon from Lando.

287
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:25.360
<v 1>They didn't reveal that. And so low, I'm going to go idiots array.</v>

288
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.790
That's that's the hardest hand to get.

289
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.150
<v 0>I mean, it's gotta be either that or fulsome buck.</v>

290
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.600
Those are the two big winning hands, correct.

291
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.940
<v 1>Idiots array is unbeatable full SubAQUA is the one that Lando was</v>

292
00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:42.070
probably trying to go for us and see was trying,

293
00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:43.560
he wanted that little green Psylocke.

294
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.910
<v 0>Yeah. I'm going to assume it was full Slovak,</v>

295
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.640
but I think there's also different versions of that you can play. There are.

296
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.270
<v 1>Yes. And even they were said to be playing, uh,</v>

297
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.230
the Numidian prime rules, uh, while they were there.

298
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:00.870
And yet Hahn's gold dice supposed to be,

299
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.440
this is something I was hoping to see because the visual dictionary say that his

300
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:09.330
gold dice were used for him to win the millennium Falcon and a version of the

301
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:12.510
game called Kirlian spike. But we didn't see that happen.

302
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:16.770
So that probably isn't true that visual dictionary bit got overwritten,

303
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.280
but he never revealed his hand. So we don't know.

304
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.820
<v 0>At Dr. Seekers says,</v>

305
00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:27.320
here's the real question does bought to celebrate Christmas because I'd love to

306
00:18:27.321 --> 00:18:31.820
see how black Spire does the holidays. That's a good question. I, you know,

307
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.980
with all the actual spires,

308
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.950
I think it would be neat to have all those decorated with lights.

309
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.020
And I bet they celebrate life. Day.

310
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.710
<v 1>Day is the star Wars equivalent of the holidays,</v>

311
00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:45.170
Christmas or whatever you want to call it.

312
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.890
And it's traditionally a Wookie celebration,

313
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.390
a them just celebrating life on their home world of Cacique,

314
00:18:53.391 --> 00:18:57.950
but it seems like it has spread throughout the galaxy a little bit more. Uh,

315
00:18:57.951 --> 00:19:02.720
and it's usually held on November 17th and life day comes from

316
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.430
the notorious original 1978 star Wars holiday

317
00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:08.600
special, uh,

318
00:19:08.601 --> 00:19:12.890
that George Lucas has since described as wishing he could hunt down every copy

319
00:19:12.891 --> 00:19:16.100
and destroy it with a hammer. It's a rough watch, frankly.

320
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.430
<v 0>Yes, it's a little trippy. Um, but they did recently revise it, uh,</v>

321
00:19:21.431 --> 00:19:24.740
and made a Lego holiday special, uh,

322
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.520
that just came out a couple of days ago actually. And it's,

323
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.140
it was just a ball of fun if we're talking strictly the bot too,

324
00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:36.890
that we see at Galaxy's edge and Disneyland and Disney world,

325
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.210
I have to imagine they're going to decorate it during the holidays.

326
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.860
Maybe we'd see Chewy's family. They're just walking around the park, but yeah,

327
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.750
I have to imagine bot to celebrates life day or some form of

328
00:19:50.751 --> 00:19:54.530
it. Thank you all so much for your star Wars questions. This.

329
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.150
<v 1>Has been star Wars support.</v>
