00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.020
<v 0>It was impossible.</v>

2
00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:05.190
It was like he was going to have to roll a one in a hundred at disadvantage.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.680
He rolls to twenties, both in that twenties road,

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.080
doubled that twenties at this advantage,

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.670
throwing a rock in a hall with magical darkness against this fleeing black

6
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:19.820
dragon. I had to give him the hit. The whole table was screaming.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.620
Ah, Oh, you know, there's no way he could hit it. He hit it.

8
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.650
And he killed that dragon. I am Joe Meghan. Hello.

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.630
And this has Dungeons and dragons.

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.643
<v 1>Support.</v>

11
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.980
<v 0>Okay. This is from silk, the Crocker,</v>

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.310
AKA Crocs fans only, Hey,

13
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.440
people who play Dungeons and dragons out there,

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.090
what's the best way to start slash learn slash get into it.

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.100
Well, I think there's two ways. You can go one, you can get three books,

16
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.190
you need three books to play D and D you need the player's handbook.

17
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:58.700
You need the dungeon masters guide and you need a monster manual. From there.

18
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.280
It's pretty, self-explanatory make a character.

19
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.230
You're going to get between 50 and 70% of how to play D and D

20
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:09.410
or at least all the necessary questions you're going to want to ask from

21
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:13.910
creating a character. So crack a player's handbook, pick a race, pick a class,

22
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.870
pick your background, get your equipment, set your character up.

23
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.750
Then from there, somebody is going to need to run the game.

24
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.930
So if you're ambitious, she loves storytelling. The way that I do,

25
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.310
you're going to lean into becoming the dungeon master rather than a player. Now,

26
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.830
dungeon masters. You're going to want to read the dungeon masters guide,

27
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:33.350
get acquainted with the monster manual sewer monsters in there.

28
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.410
You like you don't, you want to throw at your characters, blah, blah, blah.

29
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.900
Then you're going to want it either Homebrew and adventure,

30
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:42.530
which means you write your own or the other option.

31
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:46.070
I would say that just simplifies things is to get the starter kit,

32
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:50.000
which is a boxed set and everything. Once again is self-explanatory,

33
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.410
but it's on a smaller scale. That's how you get into it, brother. Oh,

34
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.460
the next question is from my buddy, Sam Woodward, Dungeons and dragons question.

35
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.100
What's a more dangerous character to have in your party,

36
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.480
lawful evil or chaotic evil. It's a great question, Sam.

37
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.440
And one that I feel like I am uniquely qualified to answer.

38
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.660
I would say the better thing for the party would be a lawful

39
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:17.180
evil character because at least there are rules.

40
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:22.040
There are collective goals that can be adhered to. You might have a, you know,

41
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.820
dragon born worshiper of Tiamat in your group, uh,

42
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.630
who plays really well with the group. And there's a collective goal,

43
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.460
but there's also because of the lawful evil, there's a kind of a long play goal.

44
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:39.200
There's a goal outside of the group that this dragon born Paladin

45
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:42.980
of Tiamat would be also attempting to achieve,

46
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.630
but they can play nice within a group.

47
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.650
It's kind of like when Magneto came to take over the X,

48
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.640
after Charles Xavier died and they can see eye to eye in a common goal,

49
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.280
but you got to watch out once you start achieving that goal,

50
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:58.820
because that lawful evil character might flip, chaotic evil. On the other hand,

51
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.440
chaotic just doesn't play nice. I've been in groups in kind of chaotic players.

52
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.270
I've dungeon master progressive caterpillars.

53
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.920
It's like a grant I'm going to gremlin in your group.

54
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.990
That's just going to throw a monkey wrench everywhere you go.

55
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.750
So I think that that would be a lot more frustrating.

56
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.370
You'd want to kill him or throw him out.

57
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.750
The next one is from star Shinobi good morning or afternoon evening,

58
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.260
depending on where you live question for today, what was your favorite way?

59
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.370
A GM has a gay master has opened a campaign or one shot.

60
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.550
We've all woken up at a cell or we're sitting in a Tavern,

61
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.980
but have you had anything unique? I'm interested. Yes.

62
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.810
My friend John castle register this adventure where we were unconscious and we

63
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.710
all woke up, didn't know where we were, had no armor, no weapons.

64
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.630
And we were all realized we were chained to each other on a slave barge.

65
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.200
So we all had to kind of wake up and then decide what to do.

66
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.730
And I was playing a minute tar.

67
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:53.350
So I started like headbutting our captors off the barge into the

68
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:55.930
water, and now we're fighting and kind of chained up.

69
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.410
And he created these cool mechanics for us being chained up and how that worked

70
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.960
and how we could try to break the chains or, you know,

71
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.780
work together or how much we can move or not move.

72
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.680
And I just thought it was really ingenious in a very, very smart way of,

73
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:11.200
of starting out. And then we had to like the guys we killed or, you know,

74
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.140
subdued we had to then, then those became our weapons.

75
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:17.530
So we were just trying to piece together anything we could get to keep fighting

76
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:20.140
and get off of this barge and, and fight for freedom.

77
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.150
So that was a cool and just, you know, off the cuff. Okay. Mariah Sanchez,

78
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.860
AKA Mariah in reality tips for a first time dungeon

79
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:32.200
master, but dungeon master is a storyteller.

80
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.990
You're a show runner of a long form narrative.

81
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.320
That's going to take place over months and maybe years.

82
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.270
So you always want to be, you know, all the, you know, few steps down the road,

83
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.590
understanding how to set up these character, arcs these story arcs,

84
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.220
and that have payoffs down the line. So with that said, you know,

85
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:52.210
what are your arcs?

86
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:55.210
What's going to be satisfying to your players and that's going to differ for

87
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:59.440
every group. So a dungeon master also has to have the type of chess,

88
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.600
like approach to storytelling,

89
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.720
where you're building these tracks out ahead. You know,

90
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.290
your three 10 moves chess moves ahead on the board from your players,

91
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.900
but you're also going to have to be empathetic to the point where you can

92
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:11.471
understand,

93
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:15.250
you can look into the heart of your players and understand what each one of them

94
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:19.870
wants from the game. Someone to hunt for treasure, someone to cause chaos,

95
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.830
mythology.

96
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.830
<v 2>And deities and, and kind of religion.</v>

97
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.520
<v 0>And in magic and deep dive storytelling.</v>

98
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.240
So you kind of want to gauge how your players are or what they like.

99
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.810
Then you're going to mold that story and be able to use those archetypical

100
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:37.560
qualities in order to build, you know, stories and to throw things at them.

101
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:39.300
You know, as a dungeon master, have fun,

102
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.730
understand your players and prep because inevitably your players are never

103
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:46.440
going to go where you think they're going to go.

104
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.960
They're going to choose their own crazy narrative.

105
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.100
They're going to kill the shopkeeper that you wanted to have become part of

106
00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:54.750
their group and this great storyline.

107
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:56.490
They're just going to murder him and steal all of his stuff.

108
00:05:56.491 --> 00:05:59.660
So you need to be for all of that in the moment. And along with prep,

109
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.310
I would say keep lists post-it notes on the inside of your dungeon master

110
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:08.360
shield with names on them, just tons of names, male names, female names,

111
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.220
human names, Dorman names, Elvin names,

112
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:15.110
just because you're going to have to be pulling those out of your way more

113
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.920
than you could ever possibly imagine. So that's another, uh,

114
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.950
probably the fourth big key to being a dungeon master is just be,

115
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.240
be ready to pull it out of your.

116
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.500
That gets into like listening to your own inspiration wherever you want the

117
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:30.440
story to go, or you get an inspiration to take it. Just take it there,

118
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.580
just go there. All right. This is from Turk owl.

119
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.110
That is a Dragon's question. Do robes get to attack twice per action.

120
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.860
If they have daggers in both hands kind of lost on this logistic. All right.

121
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.710
That's an interesting question. Yeah. I can see how that would be confusing.

122
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.250
There's a fighting style where you can,

123
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.260
you can have a second attack and there is a feat in which

124
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.000
you get to add your damage bonus. Two attacks are offhand attacks. So,

125
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.421
you know,

126
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:03.860
you either need the fighting ability or you need a feat that allows you

127
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.280
to strike with two hands. You were talking daggers here.

128
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.700
So we're talking about a small weapon rather than a large weapon,

129
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.080
which gets into a whole other thing,

130
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.770
because there are feats for fighters in which they can carry heavy weapons in

131
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:19.100
both hands. This is from at optional rule.

132
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.580
I break his knees in quotations, many,

133
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:25.100
a D and D or tabletop role-playing game,

134
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.810
game master looks on and horror as a player's torture simply doesn't do what

135
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:33.740
they want. How do you handle this in your games? Do you overlook it?

136
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.400
Penalize them, encourage them. Hey, I'm just the referee.

137
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.630
I just set up the world. I'm just the voyeur. I mean, don't get me wrong.

138
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.650
I'm also the architect of the long form story.

139
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.470
So I'm the one who's setting. The, the tracks down.

140
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.680
You can gently nudge people in the storylines that you think are going to be

141
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:53.810
really interesting, but inevitably it's up to them.

142
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.390
Cause they may decide to go the other way. So you need to be ready for that.

143
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.040
And with that said,

144
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.910
the beauty of role-playing is that you can do whatever you want.

145
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.780
If they want to kill and torture the shopkeeper, they can do that.

146
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.660
They can do whatever they want. So they're going to start with the shopkeeper,

147
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:11.300
but then they're going to take out the sheriff and his deputy when they get

148
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:13.850
there. And then they're going to take over this town and hold them hostage.

149
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.190
I always get excited, whatever the players do,

150
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.840
cause I'm just going to go with it. You know,

151
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:22.670
my players sometimes come across Hill giants in the wild and a fight

152
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.920
breaks out and they kill all the Hill giants.

153
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.820
And then when they go and they search the bodies of the Hill giants, I'll say,

154
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:30.130
yes, it's interesting.

155
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:34.720
You hear something making a noise in the pocket of the Hill. Giant's vest.

156
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.600
You look inside of the, you know, the, the vest pouch.

157
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:42.160
And it's like a little bone rattle that looks like it would fit into the hand of

158
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:45.670
a, of a baby Hill giant. Oh, and what's this, it's a,

159
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.700
it's a taxidermied Fox. That's been stuffed like a,

160
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.380
like a child's toy somewhere off in the distance. You swear, you hear the,

161
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.430
the think sound of a baby, you know? So it's like,

162
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.420
you just wiped out all the village of L giants and you think, yeah, we did it.

163
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:03.510
And now I'm going to make you feel bad because you left all these like orphaned

164
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.090
Hill, giant babies out there, screaming in the night. So it's like,

165
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.920
I always try to make my players feel bad about wiping things

166
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.780
out because there's so much just hen tromping off and

167
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:20.640
lighting people on fire in D and D that a lot of times the humanitarian angle

168
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:23.600
never gets covered, you know, but that's kind of the sense of humor that I,

169
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.480
I have of my players. You know, like I said, man, it's just have fun with it.

170
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.000
Let it go. It's not up to you. It's up to them.

171
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.430
And then you just start guiding it where you want it to go.

172
00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:33.500
Because ultimately it was the referee.

173
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.370
You can be as hard on them as you want or not depending on how you feel or,

174
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.870
you know, whatever para basis next Dungeons and dragons question.

175
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.500
What was your favorite character, class and race growing up?

176
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.460
I was big in Elvis because Elvis had a little bit of magic and a little bit of

177
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:53.120
fighting. And I really liked that too. E dragon Lance,

178
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.690
I was a minutes star. The second you could be a minute tar. I was a minute star,

179
00:09:56.691 --> 00:09:58.700
of course. And now when I say elf,

180
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.500
I'm not trying to get out of answering what's.

181
00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:05.150
My favorite class back in the day, elf was race and class. And you were an elf,

182
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.610
which means you had, you had both, which was kind of interesting.

183
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.290
I love playing a warlock or playing a warlock right now in a manmade dungeon in

184
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:16.250
the manmade campaign. And man, there's just so many tricks up their sleeve.

185
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:17.660
So for me,

186
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.340
I love playing characters that have tons of options.

187
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.110
Like I have a high-level sorcerer that I love playing because along with the

188
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.071
Metta magic,

189
00:10:28.071 --> 00:10:32.570
and then you really have tons of options and ways to get out of situations or

190
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:37.190
ways to be creative or ways to participate in the storytelling. You know,

191
00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:41.630
if you twin polymorph T-Rex is inside of a Tavern,

192
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.590
doesn't matter what the dungeon master had planned.

193
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.640
You're in charge now of the story, you know, uh, you just caused this to happen.

194
00:10:49.641 --> 00:10:53.060
So I really liked being able to really affect the story.

195
00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:57.110
And I find that those spell casters, there's a lot of wow factor. Okay.

196
00:10:57.111 --> 00:11:01.760
This is from J L J dash F last year,

197
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.680
AKA geek bot question is,

198
00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:09.440
is it weird that I practice character voices in front of the bathroom mirror?

199
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.020
No, I don't think that's weird.

200
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.690
I don't do a character voice too much when I'm a player,

201
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.190
unless I'm like delivering some Opus or some charisma check,

202
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.550
but when I've done your master, I, I it's just voices all over the place.

203
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.520
All my NPCs have voices, whether they're a lady,

204
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.780
sweet little lady works Don at the, uh, at the apothecary,

205
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.700
her name's Tony weigh-ins want, what can I get in?

206
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.720
That's basically the Pittsburgh dialect where I grew up. So, you know,

207
00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:36.980
and then my brother will start laughing.

208
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:38.660
People who've been to Pittsburgh will start laughing people,

209
00:11:38.661 --> 00:11:40.370
even who haven't been at this for start laughing,

210
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.540
cause it's such a rich character.

211
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:45.260
And it's based on somebody who works at a sandwich shop back home, you know,

212
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:49.490
that I know. And then they become a character and then, and she gave her and um,

213
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.760
see my nephew Donny in that he's a blacksmith, you know,

214
00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:55.900
and then they'd and visit Don. And he talks the same way, you know, or like,

215
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.720
you know, all of the animal familiars or, you know,

216
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:02.110
the Druid speaking to animals, then there's, there's all of those voices,

217
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.370
you know, of all of the.

218
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.960
<v 3>The Christmas, the Christmas animals in South park, you know,</v>

219
00:12:06.961 --> 00:12:10.620
if they talked to a square hole, the squirrel talks like that. Of course.

220
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.990
And then they want to talk to the horse, the horse.

221
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:14.900
<v 0>Well,</v>

222
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.740
they talked to a seagull with a seagull wasn't impressed at all with what they

223
00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:23.190
were doing. In fact, he was, he was amazed.

224
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.390
Any of them wound up alive. Uh, I was sloppy. They were, and uh,

225
00:12:27.391 --> 00:12:29.220
they asked the seagull, you know, what's your name?

226
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.890
You can call me and Christopher squawking.

227
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.250
I think you should take it a step further and film yourself doing the character

228
00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:37.980
voices. That way you could critique your performance. I don't know.

229
00:12:37.981 --> 00:12:40.350
Maybe there's some sort of career for you here.

230
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.720
You're going to become an actor or something, but no man, that's,

231
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.870
I totally do all of that. I always developed voices or,

232
00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:49.500
or figured a voice out and then make a note to myself,

233
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.000
somewhere down the line.

234
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.380
I need a character that's going to talk like Ted Knight and caddy shack,

235
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.750
you know? And then when they get to the council's, [inaudible],

236
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.940
that's usually how my DM-ing goes as well. So

237
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.790
I identify, I just pivot from voice, but you can see that it's just,

238
00:13:08.791 --> 00:13:13.170
it's endless, I'm always making notes of this voice or that voice and, uh,

239
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.330
you know, popping those characters up along the way,

240
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.030
Sarah Gushi underscore arts,

241
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.690
what would be a fearsome and evil name for a black dragon?

242
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.290
And what kind of a gem would you give him? Good question.

243
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.600
So I actually just answered this question.

244
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.250
So I designed a quest book for the relaunch of hero

245
00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:36.840
quest. I named the black dragon venom, V E N I M,

246
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.100
which I like she used to take that. And I would think, I don't know for a gem,

247
00:13:41.101 --> 00:13:45.750
I would give the black dragon, a giant amethyst, some gigantic,

248
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:50.430
huge, massive amethyst that had some sort of like,

249
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.380
even in darkness had some sort of like magical ability to

250
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.800
create light from the inside, almost like a pulsing,

251
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.370
but it's just the way that the light shifts and hits it. But even in the dark,

252
00:14:02.371 --> 00:14:03.390
you can see the light,

253
00:14:03.391 --> 00:14:07.590
sparkling and science somehow it's got its own kind of thing going on. Anyway,

254
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.510
there you go. This is from one Crip.

255
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.440
Wonder what is your favorite D and D campaign setting and why?

256
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.910
I love dragging lists. I just do. I like CRIN.

257
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.080
I liked that there are books that are companions that give you a fully fleshed

258
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:25.590
out view of the world, because I find that with some of the other worlds,

259
00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:30.540
it's very hard to get the Canon straight. And it's very hard to understand,

260
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.760
you know, pantheons and gods. And I mean,

261
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:36.210
it just seems like there's so much catch-up work and there are all answers to

262
00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:38.610
these questions, but it's like so hard to find them.

263
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.180
And there's different answers to different questions anyway, with CRIN,

264
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.220
if you don't include the fifth age stuff that was done without Margaret and

265
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.060
Tracy, if you only look at the Margaret and Tracy Canon, or at least, you know,

266
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.250
the books that they, you know, okay, you get this wreck really beautiful,

267
00:14:55.251 --> 00:15:00.230
amazing deep world that involves all the things about fantasy that I like,

268
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.400
which is, you know,

269
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.170
fighting and friendship and family and romance and love my

270
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:09.620
gosh. It just seems like they're trying to eradicate romance from,

271
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:14.330
from D and D and tabletop. And so I really love dragon lands for that reason.

272
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:17.150
It's, it's very human and, um, you understand the gods,

273
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:21.530
you understand what's at stake and there are great NPCs and villains and things.

274
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:25.070
And you know, my favorite characters in all of D and D cannon.

275
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.370
So I like dragons. I like CRIN. Um,

276
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.990
recently I've gotten into collecting all the old dark sun modules and box sets.

277
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.050
So, um, those are starting to pile up. So maybe around the holidays,

278
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:39.980
I'll be able to dive into those. Cause from Matt Holmes,

279
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.890
AKA tabletop painting,

280
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.770
if your PCs philosophy differs from the rest of the group,

281
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:49.760
do you roll up a new one conformed in a group or see how much you can get away

282
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:51.320
with behind their backs?

283
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.150
You're trying to make me an accomplice or somehow justify you destroying your

284
00:15:56.151 --> 00:16:01.030
party. Nice young man, there'll be a menace to your, her own group,

285
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:01.870
you know, uh,

286
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.810
or something where like somebody is going to want to punch you on the way up the

287
00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:05.231
stairs.

288
00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:08.800
Cause I've had players that try to split the party and that becomes their thing.

289
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.000
I'm going to go explore.

290
00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:14.500
And some character dies and people get and they have words with each other about

291
00:16:14.501 --> 00:16:19.420
it. So, you know, it's a team game play nice with other kids in the sandbox.

292
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.030
But with that said like, don't let them that get in the way of, of,

293
00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:26.980
of a great character. All right. This is from Edward R. Curtis,

294
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.900
AKA dimly underscore all that very Gothic,

295
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.640
odd Dungeons and dragons question. Typically, when making your player character,

296
00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:40.990
do you come up with the character first, then the race class stuff,

297
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.600
or the other way around choosing the race class stuff,

298
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.440
then making a character around that interesting question. Um,

299
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.830
I think it differs, I think it just differs from character to character.

300
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.200
I was a kid. We didn't have dragon.

301
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.440
Borns does came around in fourth edition and I wasn't playing.

302
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.410
I thought it was on a D and D hiatus doing like third and fourth edition.

303
00:16:59.411 --> 00:17:02.080
So when I met back up with fifth edition and I saw that you could play as the

304
00:17:02.081 --> 00:17:06.190
dragon born. And then I saw that they were chromatic. I thought, Oh man,

305
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.650
that's like playing a low level. You know,

306
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.690
our aspiring dragon high Lord or someone in the dragon army in dragon lands and

307
00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:17.140
the dragon lands books. And I just thought, man, that is like super cool.

308
00:17:17.141 --> 00:17:19.120
We didn't have, like I said, we didn't have that when I was a kid.

309
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.440
So I naturally gravitated towards picking a red dragon born first.

310
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.700
I like Paladins.

311
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.900
I thought a Paladin was a really cool class growing up and a little bit of

312
00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:30.580
magic, lots of fighting.

313
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.290
Then I saw that there was a possibility of playing an oath breaker if your

314
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:39.670
dungeon master allowed it. So that's how I built that character. Arc-on yeah.

315
00:17:39.671 --> 00:17:42.610
And then other times it's like, I already know what the character is, you know,

316
00:17:42.611 --> 00:17:47.020
he's going to be a little halfling who has all black leather and a gimp mask.

317
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.340
And he walks around and talks like, and he, you know,

318
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:53.580
and he's a wild salsa because every time he shoots magic,

319
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:56.460
he doesn't know what's going to happen. And you know, and you know,

320
00:17:56.461 --> 00:18:00.630
so all of a sudden now I have this little like German SNM,

321
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.420
halfling, wild sourcer that I just cooked up in my brain and all right,

322
00:18:05.421 --> 00:18:07.200
I'll make that character and play him. Okay.

323
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:10.530
The next one is from the Dan word spiral. I,

324
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.290
if that's a nine inch nails reference, then that's awesome.

325
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.380
Currently making some Homebrew races for my own D and D setting.

326
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.130
Any abstract ideas. Weird as good. I don't know, man. I was thought about like,

327
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.510
you know, civilization of dark gnomes, I've all kinds of other ideas that I use,

328
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.360
you know, in my game and float around. I mean, I'll give you one.

329
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.710
I wanted something between dragon and draconian. Cause I, you know,

330
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.950
I have the fifth edition draconian stats. Don't tell anyone.

331
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.160
So I wanted something in the middle there kind of like a tank that could move

332
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:38.430
in.

333
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.400
And so I've created these abominations and created a storyline of how they're

334
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:44.790
being created. And then I just started them up and, you know,

335
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.540
throw them at my players. Okay. The next question is from yum DM,

336
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.590
when a character dies and the player makes up a new character,

337
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.000
what level do you start them at?

338
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.680
An old older versions of D and D first edition, second edition.

339
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.580
Basic you had characters in a party that were all different levels because the

340
00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:07.470
game was really centered upon getting your character to the highest

341
00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:10.860
level that could possibly go getting your character, the best magical items,

342
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.220
the most gold, et cetera. You had players in the party.

343
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:17.220
You could have a ninth level player with a first level player with a second

344
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:19.860
level player. Whereas in fifth edition,

345
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.240
it is more centered around the collective story that you're telling all the

346
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:26.970
characters in the group go up at once.

347
00:19:26.971 --> 00:19:30.810
You don't have characters going up on different levels generally. So, you know,

348
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:34.170
when a character dies, jumps back in and you might play a differently,

349
00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:36.240
but all my characters are all at the same level.

350
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.510
They all moved from fourth to fifth level together from fifth level six levels

351
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:41.610
together. So it's easy to just jump them back in at that time.

352
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.170
But it's DM choice. A dungeon magic can do anything. If you think it's better.

353
00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:49.070
Storytelling wise to start somebody off at level one while the rest of the group

354
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.390
has advanced like go for it. That's totally fine. Okay.

355
00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:57.890
This is from Adam trash, mob minis, maybe a dumb question.

356
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.540
There's no dumb questions, but I'm a dumb DM. Okay.

357
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.350
How do I get the players to form bonds between their characters?

358
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.510
Is this a chemistry that happens at its own pace?

359
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.260
Or is there something I can do to catalyze connections?

360
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.000
Good questions.

361
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.920
There's always a narrative story element that can tie characters together.

362
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.540
Whether they came from the same place or they start having the same dreams and

363
00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:26.480
start relating that to each other, that somehow are tied.

364
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.180
They might've been somewhere at the same time,

365
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:34.190
but you can text them both separately in between sessions and let them know that

366
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.340
there's this part of their backstory, there's this part of their backstory.

367
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.950
But the other thing is, is like, yeah, I mean,

368
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.430
I think it's just going to happen. You know, I had a character who was a,

369
00:20:42.431 --> 00:20:45.950
a bear barbarian and it was just used to taking all the punishing damage and

370
00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:49.720
soaking that up. But there was a cleric in the group and the cleric,

371
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.320
this guy was amazing. He would keep his, my friend, Jason Liles.

372
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:57.490
He would keep track of what everyone's hip points were, everyone in the group.

373
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.890
And he was like the greatest cleric I've ever played with.

374
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.520
And he knew how many hit points I had as the barbarian and his job.

375
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.500
He would keep feeding me healing.

376
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.060
So my character's job was to soak up all the damage and make sure everybody

377
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:10.894
attacked him.

378
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.650
And it was this really great symbiotic relationship that we formed that then

379
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:17.800
became like the storyline where on a role-playing sense,

380
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:22.000
my barbarian character had done a lot of things that he regretted. And there,

381
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:26.530
here was this like Holy pious character who believed in this

382
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:30.520
God and believed that the God could save my, my character soul.

383
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.110
There became this storyline between the born out of the characters, out of the,

384
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:36.430
both of them where, um,

385
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.160
they kind of needed each other and fed off of each other. You know,

386
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.070
it's really cool when that stuff happens. So, you know,

387
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:46.360
but there's only so much of it that you can force upon your players at Oregon

388
00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:50.320
rolled a 20. What is your best DND memory?

389
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:56.230
Um, probably comes from a couple of years ago, right around the holidays,

390
00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:01.030
close to my birthday. My wife, there was this big box next to the front door.

391
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.580
She told me to go bring the box into the kitchen and I did,

392
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:06.460
and I opened it and unbeknownst to me,

393
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.880
Sophia had had someone at,

394
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.680
but then D and D connect her to Jeff easily who painted all the

395
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.690
cover paintings for the old players,

396
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:19.300
handbooks and dungeon masters guides and adventure modules.

397
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.870
It's one of the four horsemen, just, you know, one of the great, great,

398
00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:25.480
great fantasy painters of all time. And, um,

399
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.630
she got in contact with him and had him paint.

400
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.090
My arc-on, the cruel, my, my, my dragon born oath, breaker pallet,

401
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:34.870
and of TMS.

402
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.550
She surprised me with this original Jeff easily painting of

403
00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.200
arc-on in front of Tiamat. Like it was the cover of one of those old books, but,

404
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.430
you know, to be honest, like there's,

405
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.040
there's a great DND memory every week in our games.

406
00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.280
That's kind of the beauty of it. Something unexpected happens every week.

407
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.670
All right. So that's it for me, Joe Manganiello.

408
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:59.710
I want to thank the amazing artists and storytellers and

409
00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:00.430
writers,

410
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.630
Dungeons and dragons was really a Fountainhead of creativity for me as a kid is

411
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:07.570
where I learned how to build a character,

412
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.340
build a backstory where I learned long form storytelling,

413
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:16.840
as it pertains through writing and producing and directing, and, uh,

414
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.900
really just sparked my lifelong love of telling stories.

415
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:24.700
So thank you so much for your questions. I had a blast answering them and, uh,

416
00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.920
I hope we get to do it again someday. Thanks a lot.
