00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>Hello. My name is Mike loads.</v>

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.380
And today I'm going to be taking a look at how medieval weapons and

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.080
armor are portrayed in video games.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.820
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.760
<v 0>Video games. I'm going to take a look at today. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.660
kingdom come the Witcher for honor,

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.300
model chivalry, dark souls on mountain blade.

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.500
Let's take a look at how swords are used in video games,

9
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.100
forging a sword kingdom, come deliverance.

10
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.073
<v 1>Do it.</v>

11
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.030
<v 0>So what we see in this clip is the finishing stages the blade has already</v>

12
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:53.870
been made.

13
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.660
But what I like about this clip is these people clearly are taking

14
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:04.430
care. You know what you're doing? High status swords. They were made by alchemy.

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.600
It's an incredibly sophisticated process.

16
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.440
<v 1>Give it here. We'll put it all together.</v>

17
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.500
<v 0>Where it goes slightly wrong is where he's putting the grip on at the end.</v>

18
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.480
Lou, it's true that you would heat the time.

19
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:27.530
That's the little bit that comes up from the blade for, for the grip to go on.

20
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.680
What they're doing there is they've heated. Half the blade, all that art,

21
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.210
all that care to get the proper spring temper will have been lost

22
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.040
because they've heated it up in front of the way

23
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.680
I may have a little technical problem is when they put the pommel on that's the

24
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:52.160
bit that balances a sword at the end, when they put that on,

25
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.520
they just plop it on. Well, the,

26
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:58.760
the time that should come through the pommel.

27
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.990
So there's a little bit sticking up and then you hammer that over and

28
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.810
split it out, peanut out, revert it out.

29
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.050
And that's what holds everything secure. And together,

30
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.390
this Palmer would have fallen off as soon as they picked it up.

31
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:15.650
So little details are wrong, but the feel of the thing is great.

32
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.420
It's magnificent 100 versus two handed use of the

33
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.070
sword dark. So.

34
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.130
<v 2>If you tap, why, when you're in a situation like this,</v>

35
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:28.430
when you have a one handed sword and a shield, you switched to two handed,

36
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.850
but blocking with a sword doesn't really work.

37
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.870
<v 0>They kind of completely misunderstand how swords are used.</v>

38
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.890
Doesn't block a hundred percent of the damage that's just wrong.

39
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.800
Putting two hands hands-on will give you a more powerful stroke.

40
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.050
It does not in any way, hinder your ability to defend with a sword

41
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.980
when you're using a single handed, an arming sword with one hand,

42
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.290
and then clearly you're always going to favor your dominant arm because mostly

43
00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:59.800
that's going to be the stronger arm pens. I know,

44
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.510
but the mighty that the sore you don't ever block with a

45
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:09.400
sword, that's not how it's done. I'm using a front. I knock it aside.

46
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.460
I'm keeping a flow. So this idea of square blocking,

47
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.980
it may be easier for game developers to create that kind of action,

48
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.440
but it's not how it was done.

49
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.010
Single edged swords versus double-edged swords.

50
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.850
You know, the first thing I've got to say about that clip is how good I

51
00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:46.020
thought the action was. I mean, the armor, what was distracting?

52
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.770
Cause it's so fantastically.

53
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.743
<v 1>Wrong.</v>

54
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.480
<v 0>The body shapes the movements, the positions they got in,</v>

55
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.520
that was good. It had quality there.

56
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.733
<v 1>Good.</v>

57
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.930
<v 0>The advantage of a two-inch sword is if one edge is getting a little dulled,</v>

58
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:12.630
you can turn it around and you've got a second edge to you.

59
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:16.320
So it can be a considerable advantage on the battlefield that you're keeping one

60
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:17.400
edge sharp.

61
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.340
The advantage of a single edge sword is usually that it's less

62
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:27.990
expensive because you don't have to have such a sophisticated

63
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:28.824
temper.

64
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.840
<v 1>That.</v>

65
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.410
<v 0>Is authentic. As long as you're gripping tight enough,</v>

66
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.940
the sword won't move. And if it doesn't move, it won't cut you.

67
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.220
<v 1>So.</v>

68
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.330
<v 0>This person is not able to pull it through this person's hand because this</v>

69
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:48.960
person has taken it and they turned it into a lever action,

70
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.840
removing the sword from their hand.

71
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.580
So those kinds of blade grabbing this arms are authentic

72
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.260
and they are possible,

73
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.940
but they require skill and knowledge and do not try this at home.

74
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.590
Throwing a sword.

75
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.500
Soldiers are extremely versatile weapons. That's one of their advantages.

76
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:16.350
You can use them in all sorts of different ways.

77
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.990
A powerful man with a powerful thrust,

78
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.620
delivering a thrust to somebody's chest could almost stop a heart.

79
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.840
You can use it as a lever to unbalance your opponent.

80
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.610
You've got that great heavy pommel, that great metal weight on the end,

81
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:40.110
and you can deflect the sword and use the pommel to smash and punch.

82
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.250
Why, why would you throw it?

83
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.500
It is so stupid to throw away a

84
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:52.620
weapon and there's not even the person that's locked in by the weapons.

85
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.790
I just can't get my head around the idea of somebody throwing a sword,

86
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.960
decapitation, chivalry.

87
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

88
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.780
<v 0>So what we see here is clearly supposed to be a European medieval</v>

89
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:10.570
battlefield. And so in that context,

90
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.990
you wouldn't see heads cut off in this way.

91
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.320
Not least of all, because they're wearing.

92
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.720
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

93
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.910
<v 0>Could a saw do it. Yeah, you could do it.</v>

94
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:28.510
If you were fighting an army of naked people, you know,

95
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.070
the neck is one of the first areas to get protective equipment.

96
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.350
Even if you've got nothing else, you'd have a male color or coy of something.

97
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.500
<v 1>Wow.</v>

98
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.380
<v 0>Of the ways in which Arbor defends you is by creating curves</v>

99
00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:50.410
surfaces, glancing surfaces. And of course the body is always moving as well.

100
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.340
So you can never land a pure 90 degrees strikes.

101
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.520
You need enough edge just to bite in order to send that energy through.

102
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.980
And I don't believe heads fly like that. Decorated swords for honor.

103
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.140
<v 1>Your hungers for blood.</v>

104
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.020
<v 0>Obviously the first thing to say about decoration,</v>

105
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.520
it was only ever available to the wealthy, uh,

106
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.030
to princes and Kings, but it was also much,

107
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:21.700
much more restrained than we see here.

108
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.400
It's called a flamboyant blade. Cause it looks like flames.

109
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.870
What these sharp wavy edges do is

110
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.770
constantly present a curved surface to the hand.

111
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.510
So it is impossible to grab it without cutting your hand open.

112
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:42.640
Even if you were wearing a leather glove,

113
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.620
occasionally you will find one that has got some gilding on the cross guard or

114
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:48.454
on the promo,

115
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.470
but you really need to leave the blade as plain as possible because you don't

116
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.980
want to compromise the integrity of the blade.

117
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.540
You don't want to chisel into it so that you couldn't put a golden light.

118
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.640
You don't want to scroll and actually Pierce Pearson punch or do

119
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:07.570
anything to it.

120
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.740
That blade needs to perform to save your life,

121
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.060
leave it alone.

122
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.760
<v 1>Wearing.</v>

123
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.420
<v 0>A sword on your back. The Witcher three.</v>

124
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.950
So here we see a really familiar trope,

125
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.240
which is the sword being carried on the back in a

126
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.100
European medieval setting. It did not happen

127
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.680
The type of sword.

128
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.680
They using him to look similar to what we would call a medieval long sword,

129
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.760
which it was just a sword that you use with two hands would stand about that

130
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:49.594
height.

131
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.490
You just can't actually get it out.

132
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.580
I sort that length over the shoulder sort of worn,

133
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.190
wanted scabbard at the hip and outside sword. Very, very, very long sword, ah,

134
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.000
carried over the shoulder. It's just that simple Perry's for.

135
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.300
<v 1>So for this one, we actually pushed as much as we can to cover the,</v>

136
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.100
all the parts.

137
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.740
<v 0>Starts by getting the armor wrong by trying to give a</v>

138
00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:19.580
sense of,

139
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.530
of bulk and therefore presumably manners that amplifying

140
00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:28.850
the size of the armor to those shoulders and making these

141
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.010
creatures into these great sort of automatons who move in a

142
00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:36.890
very awkward and lumbering way.

143
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.670
This idea of wide swings and opening yourself up. And then, you know,

144
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.490
15 minutes later landing the blow.

145
00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:49.460
It has nothing to do with reality,

146
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.480
the art of sword fighting it's constantly keeping yourself covered.

147
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.940
They weren't lumbering slow falls.

148
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.160
They were martial artists, athletes, lightning,

149
00:10:04.161 --> 00:10:07.250
fast reflexes who had a system,

150
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.970
a fighting style that was immensely sophisticated.

151
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:17.540
Next let's take a look at access, throwing an ax more now.

152
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.793
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.910
<v 0>What we see here is two types of acts,</v>

154
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:32.090
a larger acts that he's using with two hands. He takes out a smaller acts,

155
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.280
which he uses to throw

156
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.390
looking at the armor and the clothing.

157
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:41.790
It looks to be more kind of late medieval. Uh,

158
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:45.830
and both of those axes shown are from a much, much,

159
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.660
much earlier medieval period from the sort of Frankish Saxon Viking

160
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:53.660
period. The axes of the later medieval period,

161
00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:57.290
wasn't known as battle axes were predominantly a Horseman's weapon.

162
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.300
They're not for throwing the Polacks for honor.

163
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.200
<v 1>They carry the most versatile weapon ever invented.</v>

164
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.430
<v 0>First.</v>

165
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.670
Then the narrator is calling it a Polacks instead of a Polacks the worst such

166
00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:18.230
things as pole arms, and a whole family of weapons that are,

167
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.580
that are on long poles.

168
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.500
But the Polacks P O double L X is what Knights

169
00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:27.830
called this slightly shorter polo.

170
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:34.220
The Polacks was between four and five foot in height.

171
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.280
Not, not, not a super long poem. It,

172
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.380
it it's very much a weapon that nights when they were fighting on foot,

173
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.700
this was their favorite weapon. It was substantial. And at the top end,

174
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:48.410
it had an ax head and a hammerhead. You know, this was a great chunk of metal.

175
00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:50.960
So that could land a fearsome bow.

176
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.770
On top of that was a and most importantly at the bottom

177
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.890
was this steel spike, a.

178
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.470
<v 1>Secret, the peak.</v>

179
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.580
<v 0>And it was that air that you did most of your fighting with them.</v>

180
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.730
<v 1>When they arrived.</v>

181
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.510
<v 0>One of the great advantages of the Polacks is it has region.</v>

182
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.270
You can really work at close distance and long distance.

183
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:23.370
And when you get in there, you can use that shaft as a lever.

184
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.490
They're doing it here. And that is right.

185
00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:29.580
That is straight out of the manuals that you get that in there,

186
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.820
you get it behind that legs. It's the right spirit of the thing.

187
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.390
Let's see how bows and arrows are portrayed in video games,

188
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.850
the crossbow Mount. Okay.

189
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:42.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

190
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.370
<v 0>One of the cunning things about this clip is they don't</v>

191
00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:50.100
show you how the crossbow is being lit.

192
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.850
I have this really rather unrealistic, right?

193
00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.893
<v 1>A shooting.</v>

194
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.530
<v 0>The thing called a belt and claw where a claw hung from a belt and you went down</v>

195
00:13:07.531 --> 00:13:10.150
and hooked that under the thing. And you had your foot in the then,

196
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:14.700
and you used your whole pot to strain and your legs and your thighs was

197
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.000
straining to pull that string back and, and hook it behind the trigger.

198
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.310
<v 1>It certainly.</v>

199
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.330
<v 0>Couldn't be done as quickly as in this clip</v>

200
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.360
loading and aiming chivalry.

201
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:37.050
There are two stages to preparing that Longbow to shoot.

202
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.740
The first one is what we call knocking. And that's the, you know,

203
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.730
the little notch at the end of the arrow and getting that fitted to the strip.

204
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.270
This clip, the speed of getting the arrow onto the strip was credible. That,

205
00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:56.850
that I could shoot that fast. Maybe even a little faster.

206
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.530
What takes longer is the second stage.

207
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.390
The drawing back you're drawing a long bow from your feet to your neck.

208
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:11.370
Every muscle is engaged in pulling that string back and you

209
00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:14.430
pull it back here behind the ear.

210
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.650
A Longboat is a powerful weapon,

211
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.870
180 pounds, maybe even 200 pounds draw weight.

212
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.720
The amount it takes to pull that string back.

213
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.160
This is a massive athletic

214
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:37.080
endeavor that has to be repeated over and over again.

215
00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:39.210
So there are questions of stamina.

216
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.080
Although we don't see very much of him, we can see part of his arches equipment,

217
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.490
which is a leather bracelet on the inside of his left

218
00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.990
forearm. And what it's for is it's for string slap.

219
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.120
As the string comes through, it just can't catch that arm. Just get us now,

220
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.350
have you got 150, 180 200 pound Longbow.

221
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.270
I can assure you that string slap. You never want to pull that bow back again.

222
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.150
Flaming arrows chivalry too.

223
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.610
So it looks great. Doesn't it? We see these incendiary arrows,

224
00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:21.700
like the lightning strikes streaming across the sky.

225
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.710
My experience with flaming hours is they don't stay a light in the sky looking

226
00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:30.880
quite so wonderful as that, but they do work and they did exist.

227
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.180
Does it have any practical military function?

228
00:15:34.181 --> 00:15:36.580
And is it real well?

229
00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:41.200
You certainly wouldn't use them in an open battlefield like that because it's

230
00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:44.740
pointless. What are you going to do? Set individual people alight as a bonus,

231
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.900
cause you've already guilt with your error.

232
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.730
You would use them in sieges and in Tara raids,

233
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.450
fire has always been a dreadful,

234
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.920
awful terrible weapon.

235
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.690
Let's look at some other medieval weapons that are popular in video

236
00:16:01.691 --> 00:16:04.600
games, Spears, Maude house

237
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.340
Wantage of a spear is its reach. Uh,

238
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.350
you got cavalry coming towards you. You can extend it. You know,

239
00:16:20.351 --> 00:16:24.820
you can go for the horse. The disadvantage of a spear is its reach.

240
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.890
There's that much of weapon on the end of a stick.

241
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.790
Once you've extended and thrust that if the person gets inside that point,

242
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.810
it's easy to either Cleve your thin wooden shaft with,

243
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:36.340
with their sword or their ax,

244
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.540
or to get hold of that spear and wrench it out of your hand.

245
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.490
Once he's inside the point, the speed is useless. Mace chivalry.

246
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.300
<v 0>Macy's is a general blunt force.</v>

248
00:16:52.301 --> 00:16:55.270
Weapon were widespread on the medieval battlefield.

249
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.480
What we see here when they call it a maze, it's more like a morning star,

250
00:17:01.481 --> 00:17:04.330
which is a kind of a two handed mace with spikes on,

251
00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:05.620
which came in a little bit later.

252
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:08.463
<v 1>Something that all.</v>

253
00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:11.920
<v 0>Armor had in common is it deflected below.</v>

254
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.770
It gave a skidding surface.

255
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.330
It's very difficult to get that energy into the man underneath,

256
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.270
unless you can get a microsecond of bite.

257
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:27.400
So that's really what the spikes before they look really grizzly and play into

258
00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:29.440
our idea of a medieval brutality.

259
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:35.140
But all that for is for grabbing hold of the target

260
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.580
in order to deliver the energy through the armor

261
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.820
flail for honor.

262
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.320
<v 1>Their flail is as dangerous to the wielder as it is to the,</v>

263
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.070
I mean, the.

264
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.180
<v 0>Idea is if the same as a mace, it's a blunt force drama rapid,</v>

265
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.930
but it's disadvantages. Having struck that Jane goes limp and comes down.

266
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.070
You'd have to prepare it with relatively wide strokes.

267
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.650
We really have no strong evidence that it was ever

268
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.460
a real thing. We do have evidence, however,

269
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.940
that it was thought of throughout the medieval period,

270
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.590
military engineers and artists and designers produced military

271
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:23.424
manuals.

272
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.650
<v 3>Sometimes, however you find a diamond in the rough.</v>

273
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.750
<v 0>The DaVinci was one of a long line of designers of military machines.</v>

274
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.760
A lot of machines and ideas in here never

275
00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:40.850
happened. Daggers, dark, sorry.

276
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.370
<v 3>The dagger uses very little stamina.</v>

277
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.820
So you can attack many times over before depleting your stamina,

278
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.380
even if you have low internal.

279
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.040
<v 0>So daggers were pretty much a universal weapon on the,</v>

280
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.390
on the medieval battlefield.

281
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.920
Everybody carried a dagga clearly a weapon of last resort.

282
00:18:57.921 --> 00:19:00.980
It's a weapon of close hand to hand fighting.

283
00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:05.720
What I found extraordinary on this clip is whether the aeration said do note

284
00:19:05.721 --> 00:19:09.260
that the range is short. I just wanted to shout on his ear. Well,

285
00:19:09.261 --> 00:19:13.340
let go of one hand and you'll double your reach because obviously you've got

286
00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:15.980
limited reach if you're working like that. But you know,

287
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.600
I've now got double league.

288
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.570
<v 3>It's about how you use what you.</v>

289
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.440
<v 0>It's a one handed weapon. It's not a two handed weapon.</v>

290
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.330
Now we're going to talk about tactics taking over a village kingdom,

291
00:19:29.331 --> 00:19:31.130
come deliverance.

292
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.980
This clip had the, the element of surprise and you know,

293
00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:47.180
for any attack on a village to be successful, it needs an element of surprise.

294
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.890
Of course, if you're attacking with an army of that size,

295
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.200
there's not going to be any surprise.

296
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.500
You would hear them from miles away.

297
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.640
You would see the clouds of dust from miles away.

298
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.430
So raiding parties would be small.

299
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.540
You wouldn't need more than 2030 men to raid a village like that.

300
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.520
They'd use incendiary arrows.

301
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.010
They would get up through with flaming torches and drop them in the buildings.

302
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.260
You don't need a big army to attack a small village.

303
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.330
You do need surprise firebomb weapons for honor. Did we get 12?

304
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.810
<v 1>It's pretty excessive.</v>

305
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.730
<v 0>They had clay pots,</v>

306
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.870
which they filled with what was really Greek fire,

307
00:20:44.871 --> 00:20:49.120
which was a secret recipe developed in 70 or so by my

308
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.980
clinicals. And this was an incredible flammable substance that,

309
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:57.310
that just kept on burning that even burn on water.

310
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.033
<v 1>Take that sir.</v>

311
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.130
<v 0>Around the battlefield with a flammable pots are pretty dangerous</v>

312
00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:05.730
business.

313
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.150
It's not like pulling the pin on a grenade where you know exactly the moment

314
00:21:09.151 --> 00:21:09.900
you're going to throw it.

315
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.880
They really need to be deployed from a fixed position and best used in a range

316
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.850
weapon. Like first of all, with a great CG engine,

317
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.200
like a trevorshay circle formation, mountain blade,

318
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.933
[inaudible]

319
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.410
Certain cavalry situations or circle formation is exactly what you

320
00:21:34.411 --> 00:21:37.590
need. Especially if you're outnumbered the Scott scolded,

321
00:21:37.591 --> 00:21:39.390
the Shelton pioneered that.

322
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:44.250
<v 1>No.</v>

323
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.870
<v 0>So much. I would suggest against, uh, an artillery attack with an arrow storm.</v>

324
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.530
The Bowman only have to range slightly differently.

325
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.540
And they've got the backs of the people undefended with their

326
00:21:57.541 --> 00:21:59.850
shields at that the other side of the circle

327
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.980
Come and get me, shoot me in the back.

328
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.990
I wouldn't choose a circle that size because there's so much

329
00:22:09.991 --> 00:22:11.340
room in the middle.

330
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.660
You could get quite a lot of horsemen smashing through the line of two that

331
00:22:15.661 --> 00:22:20.610
you've got there and they could wreak havoc round the backs of the other troops.

332
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.140
Don't periodically keep breaking your formation.

333
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.760
Otherwise there's no point in having it fighting on horseback

334
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.100
Mount and blade banner

335
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.610
Marie can be used in two main ways.

336
00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:46.350
You have heavy cavalry smashing into a massive troops for the

337
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.460
impact charge.

338
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.590
And you have light cavalry with swords or bows or

339
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.280
even light lances, skirmishing or raiding,

340
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.100
or just hurrying troops on the battlefield.

341
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.930
<v 0>Yeah. We're seeing versatile light cavalry skirmishing.</v>

343
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:09.690
<v 1>The weapon. The.</v>

344
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.320
<v 0>First strike for the horseman is the Lance,</v>

345
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.410
the long Lance over your back.

346
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.720
That's the cavalry charge, but it's a one strike weapon,

347
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.410
one kebabs each, and you're done.

348
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.420
It's greatest benefit is not just the speed of delivering attacks.

349
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.540
It's the ability to pull back and come again,

350
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.490
Ability on a horse.

351
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.260
You couldn't even begin to match with a man on foot.

352
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.610
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

353
00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:52.870
<v 0>You know, the stamina of a horse to do those repeated attacks.</v>

354
00:23:52.871 --> 00:23:55.780
That's really where it gives you the edge.

355
00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.850
Let's look at defensive weapons, shield shapes, mod,

356
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:01.750
how.

357
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.600
<v 4>I wanted to talk about shields and Mortel okay.</v>

358
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:09.070
<v 0>The earliest type shown in this clip is the kite shield.</v>

359
00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.130
<v 4>You can easily block pretty much anything in front of.</v>

360
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.480
<v 0>A sort of Norman style shield from the sort of</v>

361
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.200
11th century by the 12th hundred had already gone out.

362
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:24.840
So it has a very limited time period to a very specific culture.

363
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.250
<v 4>The kite shield is a much larger shields.</v>

364
00:24:27.251 --> 00:24:31.180
That pretty much envelops the entire body from head to your shins.

365
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.370
<v 0>Usually that shield gets shorter and more compact</v>

366
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.340
as armor for the lower leg gets better.

367
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.280
And you end up with what's called the heater shield.

368
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:47.170
Very good for protecting the upper torso, especially when you're on horseback.

369
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.670
And you need that extra layer of protection too.

370
00:24:51.671 --> 00:24:52.870
With Stan,

371
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.240
the extraordinary force of being struck with a

372
00:24:58.241 --> 00:25:00.100
Lance by a man on a horse.

373
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.880
<v 4>Moving on to the peri shields, we have the targe and the bucket.</v>

374
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.140
<v 0>The Taj around shield. This one is specifically a kind of Scott's weapon.</v>

375
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.500
It it's smaller than the Viking round shield. It had, you know,

376
00:25:11.501 --> 00:25:12.790
more maneuverability.

377
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.230
<v 4>Rather than just blocking with your weapon. You simply block with your shield.</v>

378
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:22.240
<v 0>The Highland Scots were famous for their charge running in that kilt across the</v>

379
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.600
Heather. You don't want something clumsy. You want something light,

380
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.580
but they're facing arrows.

381
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.600
That's what shields are for they're for facing arrow storms. The better.

382
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.860
<v 4>Clara and the targe have very minor differences between them but functioning</v>

383
00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:39.070
exactly the same in terms of size.

384
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.350
They have the exact same block radius.

385
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:46.450
<v 0>The type of shield that is used almost exclusively for hand-to-hand fighting</v>

386
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:51.400
is the buckler. This was a specialist, little shield, little round shield,

387
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.230
completely faced with steel, a little steel fist.

388
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.710
You use it like a fist. You punch the enemies, weapons away,

389
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.100
swords coming in here. You punch it away, very skillful,

390
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.910
but very fast flowing way of fighting.

391
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.370
<v 4>The final shield and Morehouse is the paradise.</v>

392
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.960
<v 0>The [inaudible] complete polar opposite of the buckler.</v>

393
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:17.560
The [inaudible] is a static shield.

394
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.540
It just sits there.

395
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.330
<v 4>It can be placed down pretty much anywhere.</v>

396
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:24.460
I'm a flat surface or even rough terrain.

397
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:25.691
<v 0>Crossbow.</v>

398
00:26:25.691 --> 00:26:30.250
One carried on their backs set up on the battlefield because

399
00:26:30.251 --> 00:26:34.240
they had to shelter behind something to work.

400
00:26:34.241 --> 00:26:37.060
The claw mechanism of loading their bows.

401
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:41.050
It was a question of different shields for different fields,

402
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.330
but they all had a different Arma mod.

403
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.603
<v 1>Wow.</v>

404
00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.210
<v 0>The most important thing about armor is that it gives you as much protection as</v>

405
00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:53.780
possible.

406
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

407
00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.020
<v 0>The second most important thing about armor is that it allows you to fight</v>

408
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.970
as well as possible.

409
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.390
What I love about this clip is that it starts with a Knight running

410
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.160
whilst wearing armor.

411
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.890
That is a reality a night would be able to run to

412
00:27:18.891 --> 00:27:23.300
sprint in Alma Boosie code one of the generals of the French army at

413
00:27:23.301 --> 00:27:27.650
Agincourt. He was known to go for a mile run in his armor every morning.

414
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.380
The Dropkick is probably a little bit fantastical, but, um,

415
00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:36.110
I was designed for the fighting man,

416
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:42.320
the way we see a sword siting through arm, and that that's just playing fantasy.

417
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.120
It was fine as fantasy, but it's certainly not a reality.

418
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.050
So there's a lot of different types of armor playtime at the time that we're

419
00:27:51.051 --> 00:27:55.730
seeing here a second skin of metal and excess skeleton of

420
00:27:55.731 --> 00:27:56.564
metal,

421
00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.520
where the night became a walking work of art and it was tailored to

422
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.530
precision so that every joint articulated

423
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.240
the most vulnerable points are those articulation points.

424
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.430
So if you are raising your sword to strike,

425
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.570
then that is more vulnerable than the bits covered with a plate,

426
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.840
but they had things called [inaudible], which, which are little metal discs.

427
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.120
They have solutions to these problems.

428
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.550
So there is this constant trade off between weight,

429
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.950
articulation and protection.

430
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:36.890
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

431
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.730
<v 0>That has been extremely interesting to me as a dull old historian,</v>

432
00:28:40.731 --> 00:28:45.230
to look at how these weapons are represented in video games.

433
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.400
What's exciting about video games today is it's often the first hook,

434
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:54.320
the first lure to get young minds interested in history and

435
00:28:54.321 --> 00:28:59.060
history is exciting and we mustn't lose the excitement just

436
00:28:59.061 --> 00:29:02.450
because of a few details that might not be right.
