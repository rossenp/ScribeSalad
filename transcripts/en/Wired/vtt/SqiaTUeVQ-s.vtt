00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.140
<v 0>Wow. I love this.</v>

2
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm thrilled.

3
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.230
The presentation was created by wired.

4
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:18.380
We've quantified your digital footprint so that you can see the impact you've

5
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.530
had on the internet. Oh, that's cool. That's neat.

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.990
I wonder what it means.

7
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.070
This is what happens when you Google the try guys. All right.

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.200
That's too many, three very common words. It does not surprise me.

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.910
1 billion. 540 million. Wait.

10
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.340
Yeah. Yeah. And it only took

11
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.290
0.71 seconds to find that money, Google, you sure are a trial.

12
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.250
It looks like the first video that pops up is the try guys.

13
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.020
Try Korean snacks for the first time I conic on exactly.

14
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.640
Not especially a big head. Yeah.

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.600
Or that bright and next the track guys try to make pants without

16
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:06.770
instructions.

17
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.240
S one of our favorite recent videos without instruction series.

18
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:13.340
It's about us doing things without instruction.

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.650
We like to try guys without blank titles that need to be very literal for

20
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:21.500
us. It writes itself. There's a track. I was Wiki. Wow.

21
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:25.040
We have a Wiki and it's not even just about feet. That's awesome. Wow.

22
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.840
That's huge for it. I had no idea that existed.

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.700
I have no idea what could be in the Wiki.

24
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:32.450
It's probably just that we said one section that comes up is people also ask

25
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.280
what happened to the try guys.

26
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.570
So it was a terrible plane crash when it happened to us. I need to know.

27
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.860
Are the track guys really friends? No. With others,

28
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.750
friends doesn't even begin to describe who we are. We're friends with benefits.

29
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.420
I'd say we like to think of ourselves more as brothers,

30
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:54.290
because friends get into arguments and split up brothers,

31
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:57.830
get into arguments and stay together. Brothers don't have a choice. Yeah.

32
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.080
I was adopted who is the most popular try guy? You know,

33
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.710
like it's hard to say who Eugene? Yeah. Quantifiably,

34
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.640
Eugene and qualitatively Eugene.

35
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.440
He has a lot more Instagram followers.

36
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.430
I like to think of myself as the most popular. Anyway.

37
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.580
That's what I like to think. Who started the track guys?

38
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.820
Technically the four of us did it together.

39
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.740
I'd say the most common misconception is that, uh, we were cast together,

40
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:29.390
but we, it was a self-made thing.

41
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:31.820
We found each other and it was really actually like,

42
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.210
I think you could say the audience created the try guys. We made a video.

43
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.510
It worked. They asked for more. Here we are. That's right.

44
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.860
Who created the track? Guys? You, you did baby. Oh God.

45
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.690
This is a Google trends. Graph of the try guys searched over time. A,

46
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:49.790
B and C three points here. What do we think?

47
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.770
A is probably the start of us like date. Oh, you know what though?

48
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:58.760
I bet you that's our motherhood series because like you see the beginning of the

49
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:02.260
try. Oh yeah. So AI is going to be our motherhood series.

50
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.010
B is probably when we launched our new company and our new channels.

51
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.080
And then C has to be our summer of try where a whole bunch of

52
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.570
things happened. We went on a 20 city tour.

53
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.890
Eugene released a music video coming out called I'm gay.

54
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.020
We also, uh, released our book, the hidden power of effing up.

55
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.411
I mean,

56
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:28.360
it was just like the biggest wildest summer of our lives and a podcast

57
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.120
and podcast overdue for another spike.

58
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.690
No steady decline per Google image search.

59
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.840
Here are some other words associated with the try guys,

60
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.440
Speedo with a photo backseat in target.

61
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.460
That's definitely key. I got a freak tongue,

62
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:49.390
baby aesthetic. I am aesthetic.

63
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.220
Thank you testosterone.

64
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.410
We did a very controversial testosterone tests. It was very funny. Actually.

65
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:01.300
Any testosterone searches are from, uh, outright trolls. I love that size.

66
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.873
Wow. Yeah. I'm telling you, man,

67
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.540
there was a huge soy boy moment where they were trying to use us to prove a

68
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.600
feminization of garbage. And I, you know, come out of hell.

69
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.980
We try to combat toxic masculinity through our videos and our work.

70
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.610
Sometimes people who are toxic try and fight back.

71
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.810
I'll say we don't care. Yeah. We don't care. Yeah. Look,

72
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:24.400
I think with everything that we do,

73
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:29.320
we try to show that there is no one right way to be a man to be a person.

74
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.890
Uh, and yeah, you can still be tiny and delicate and cute and still be awesome.

75
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.180
You can be big and suck a magic mic.

76
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.310
Yes, I do. Resemble Channing Tatum from the face down. Honestly,

77
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:46.450
if you read all of these together, it sounds like a Madlibs for bad porn.

78
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.490
We searched Reddit for the try guys. And these were some of the top results.

79
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.630
Can we guess what they are based on the name of the sub Reddit R slash beauty

80
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.700
guru chatter. Hm.

81
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.260
I think this one is we recreated some UT gurus,

82
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.060
iconic looks. So I bet that

83
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.820
you said that kind of say you're like, like a Euro meets a guru.

84
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.190
[inaudible] there we go. Beauty guru. Well, you're right man.

85
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.340
Yeah. Right.

86
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.960
We went on eBay and found the least expensive and most expensive items when

87
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:31.590
searching the try guys. I have no idea what they could be.

88
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.000
And even though we were on eBay,

89
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.440
there's some knockoff like these knockoffs or are these like maybe someone is

90
00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:40.200
selling like a signed hoodie from the tour or something? Yeah.

91
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.060
They could be very excited. Let's see what the starting bid is. $200,

92
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:49.470
$200, probably like a signed hoodie as a signed copy of our book.

93
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.430
Ah, Oh, I'm going to tell you what you're getting. You're overpaying for that.

94
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:56.910
We're still selling them. We still have them and they don't cost that much.

95
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.410
Let's try guys.com 50 bucks. They Google Keith Haber's burger.

96
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:05.360
And these were some results. There's only 305,000.

97
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.130
That feels like drastically less than billions. Let's see what we got.

98
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.570
That's still feels like a lot. So I'm worried that their star with me,

99
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:18.500
because I had the lowest number. Why did Keith Haber's burger leave worth it?

100
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.430
Everybody thinks they kicked me off the show. That's not true.

101
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.180
I had something else to do. I was very supportive of them. Everybody's like,

102
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:28.970
he's a Dick. I'm a Dick. I was very supportive. Old time.

103
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:32.210
Everyone was real mean to me about him. There's no reason. I never said why.

104
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.770
So Keith, you chose us over worth it. I did. And I forgot some sway.

105
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.460
Me ever since. Have you seen the graph? Oh,

106
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.980
here's some related image searches to me. I'm excited for that.

107
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.860
Keith Evansburg and funny face. What would you want? Is it it's the one that

108
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.030
yeah. No.

109
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.420
I think that might be the screenshot I took and I posted all over Twitter and I

110
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:55.720
was like, this is my new reaction means it's my favorite. Wow. Which I first,

111
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.210
I first was using his reaction to him on our text threads,

112
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.230
filtrated his Google search. Wow. It's a beautiful, funny.

113
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.940
It shakes me to my core spiritually. Ethically.

114
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.740
It is against God's designed here's some top Reddit search results for Keith

115
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.190
burgers sorted by relevance, dancing with the stars.

116
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.630
No way am I going to be on dancing with the stars? Who are you kidding me?

117
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.550
Let me dust off some moves.

118
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.270
When searching Amazon for Keith Harrisburg or you found the following products,

119
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.800
probably chicken sauce, chicken,

120
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.830
chicken sauce in the three pack on amazon.com. I have a line of hot sauces.

121
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.670
They're delicious. They're not too hot. Get yourself some burger sauce more.

122
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.230
They're just gonna say it. I think burger solves better.

123
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.810
I like the original better. It's great on eggs.

124
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.020
It's great on sausage grid on pizza. It's great on everything, but you know,

125
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:51.070
I'm a big ranch boy. We Googled Nan Fullmer and these were some results.

126
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.990
People also ask about me. What is Ned? Farmer's real name?

127
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.470
Ned Fulmer. No, no, my,

128
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.530
I mean maybe they're asking what is my real name?

129
00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:07.390
My real name is Edward med. That real name was Edward.

130
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:11.440
We were all shocked. So the core inside tri guys,

131
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.240
net Fulmars custom, California home from architectural digest.

132
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.130
My wife and I did a home renovation and to reveal it,

133
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.640
we were featured on architectural digest. She's very proud of it.

134
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.180
It's a huge deal. It's a big deal. I am also very proud of it.

135
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.510
Surprise pregnancy announcement to Wes Ned and Ariel.

136
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.200
We just had a new baby. Uh,

137
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.650
and when we found out about it, we told our son West, you know,

138
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:41.680
we have the try guys channel. I have a couple videos on my personal channel.

139
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:44.170
It's mostly surprise pregnancy announcements,

140
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.270
some related image searches for me. I Ned former. I don't know what this one is.

141
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.450
You have a very beautiful eye color. Oh thank you.

142
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.520
Maybe it's from that one picture of you where your eyes are, so, Oh yeah,

143
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:00.290
that must be it. How sometimes you smile for a photo,

144
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:03.440
but then the photo turns out and it doesn't really look right.

145
00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:07.490
Full frontal flash me smiling like this Zach Kornfeld.

146
00:09:07.491 --> 00:09:08.690
And these were some of the results,

147
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.860
409,000 to 2.1 second. So they really had to,

148
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.000
it's worked for that. Who was struggling,

149
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.070
not more keep looking this one's from Washington, post one,

150
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:26.300
a top of the box office during a pandemic film for free on zoom and then rent

151
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.070
out a theater. This is very exciting. Look,

152
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:30.290
we all have amazing talents and skills. However,

153
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:33.680
I am the only official movie star of the try guys. Yes.

154
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:38.600
I was the star of the number one movie in America. Uh, my buddy, Eric,

155
00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:42.650
Dubach had this idea during the pandemic that since there were no new movies

156
00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:44.720
coming out, we could film a movie,

157
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.310
rent out a theater and then just buy all the tickets again and again and again.

158
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.210
So he did that. Uh, and I think with $26,000,

159
00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:57.050
it was the number one movie in America that week. Very exciting for me,

160
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.870
very depressing for the state of the movie industry.

161
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.580
I get to say forever that I was the star of the number one movie of America.

162
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.160
It's just one of the many things will Smith and I have in common,

163
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.330
we search Zach cornfield on Getty images. Can you tell us about these?

164
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.520
Oh yeah. This is me being the doggo and or gimp for poppy.

165
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.060
Poppy is a friend of ours. She is a wonderful, weird musician.

166
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:25.130
We were hosting the streamings and she came with us three leather bound

167
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.200
gimps she was walking them like they were dogs and she was backstage and she was

168
00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:33.440
very sad. And I said, poppy, what's wrong? And poppy said, well,

169
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.950
the producers won't let me bring my gifts on stage. And I said, well,

170
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.370
poppy I'll do it. And she went really? And I'm like, yeah, I'm the host.

171
00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:43.610
What are they gonna do? It's like, let's do this. They can't fire me.

172
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.600
We're in the middle of a show.

173
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.920
So she put a leash on my neck and I started walking out and I see the producers

174
00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:53.840
go like, Nope. And then they kind of like, okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

175
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.130
Then the following year they elected not to have it host. It was very weird.

176
00:10:58.131 --> 00:11:02.090
I'm realizing, yeah. Like this alone should be the weirdest moment of my life.

177
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.840
I kind of forgot about it. I don't go myself very much.

178
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:09.470
I terrified of seeing what the internet has to say about Meg, as you know,

179
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.830
it's just not comfortable. So I really have no idea. What's gonna come up.

180
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.000
We Google the Eugene Liang and these were some results.

181
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.840
Well, 1.5 million because you put Eugene Liang and I'm gay.

182
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.210
Oh, perhaps,

183
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.500
maybe you don't think it's because we and yang are two of them. Oh yeah.

184
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.600
Maybe that's it. Maybe that's it.

185
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.320
The gene Leanne goes viral cost playing avatars in the last Airbender. Yeah.

186
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.270
I think there was actually a lot of press coverage. I wasn't aware of,

187
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.070
of my cost place. I did, uh,

188
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.780
Zuko Azula and Kyoshi from one of my favorites,

189
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.590
American animated series, and people loved it.

190
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.700
15 LGBTQ youth tubers, Brie Larson should collab with that.

191
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.780
That would be fantastic. Brie Larson is amazing. And she,

192
00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:59.950
I believe started a YouTube channel, Eugene Liang movies and TV shows,

193
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.930
comfort girls. Uh,

194
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:06.190
so this was actually a short film I produced and it was part of a Asian

195
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:09.310
American film organization that I was a part of.

196
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.970
And it was an amazing short film. We've seen it. It's fantastic. It's cool.

197
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.130
He's very talented. I'm not a princess. Huh.

198
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:20.080
So that was actually a spec music video I made for the artists Marina

199
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:23.710
and the diamonds. Who's amazing. Self-funded it self cast. It choreographed.

200
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:26.200
It created this entire 12 minute video.

201
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.730
It was me reinterpreting old fairytales and turning the gender norms on their

202
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:34.570
heads. Here are some of the top Reddit search results for Eugene Liang sorted by

203
00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:37.330
relevance. Ah, so this is my coming up video.

204
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.900
I still watch this video all the time.

205
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.240
Eugene Liang from Buzzfeed slash the try guys comes out as gay with a beautiful

206
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.920
choreography to one of my favorite Odessa songs posted to our slash

207
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.840
late bloomer lesbians. Well, I love that Reddit, uh, group.

208
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.780
We were going on a tour where my entire section was about being gay and I was

209
00:12:57.781 --> 00:13:00.780
about to bring gay pride across the nation and not my whole family didn't know I

210
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:03.390
was gay, so I had to make something. And so I, uh,

211
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.970
basically was going to do it on my own. And then I was like,

212
00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:08.670
why would I do this? Because we have a company. So I was like, okay,

213
00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:10.680
I'll put it on the channel. And I did it within a month.

214
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.570
This was an interesting example.

215
00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:16.140
And you'll probably see more of this in our documentary of my public life.

216
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.310
Especially as a video producer, uh, proceeding my private life.

217
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.050
And it sort of forced my hand.

218
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.290
And so I had to respond to it through my public work.

219
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.200
And so it was very emotionally difficult.

220
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.370
And I would say that in the end it was a great excuse to be able to come out to

221
00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:34.410
some people I'm close to. But yeah, that's fantastic.

222
00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:39.360
I really hope that anyone who still comes across this video in

223
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:44.340
you is moved by it or the old something from what I had to say in

224
00:13:44.341 --> 00:13:45.600
the moment. And yeah,

225
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.870
I'm still incredibly proud of the conversation that it started.

226
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.610
I would not advise anyone publishing a multi-million view video to come out to

227
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.050
your parents, but,

228
00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.300
but in the end it worked out really well because I think the impact also helped

229
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.340
people. I love show how important this is to an entire community.

230
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:07.080
So, you know, in the end it worked out,

231
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.100
we searched Eugene Liang or Getty images. Can you tell us about these images?

232
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:16.170
Oh, my this photo was actually from the first comedy show was ever part of and

233
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.170
Keith attended with did Becky. And, um,

234
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.230
it was basically storytelling from a lot of entertainers.

235
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.210
I actually thought it went pretty well. I had to,

236
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:29.130
I basically did like a country music redo of my childhood fun fact.

237
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.540
I really love country. Mm. Uh, such tall hair.

238
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.590
This was from the Asian Americans end of the year award show.

239
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.180
This was the first year I attended. I was honored with rakeout male star,

240
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.400
which was fantastic. This was, I think 2016,

241
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:48.630
but I was also honored alongside like Steven noon. And I mean,

242
00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:52.760
there were actual stars there. I was just, I was just like little old me.

243
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.370
It was crazy because the Asian American community,

244
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:58.880
especially in Hollywood are very tight and we're all very supportive.

245
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.460
And this is my favorite award show to go to. Because after this,

246
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.200
I made this sort of the platform for me to really express a lot of my gender

247
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.303
style.

248
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.050
So the subsequent years I just got Geyer and gayer and

249
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.890
gayer and man do some of those old Asian guys not know what they're looking at,

250
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:19.580
but yeah, you knew I was strutting around and that was one of the years,

251
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.170
move on herself. Ming. Now,

252
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:25.340
when came out to me and said I was a gorgeous unicorn and I cried and I never

253
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.000
cry.

254
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.050
I was also very drunk cause they are also always sponsored by whiskey brands

255
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.230
because they are run by Koreans and we love whiskey.

256
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.330
I feel like that's a pretty good byline for you.

257
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:39.560
Most of the really gay and beautiful and also drunk that was true.

258
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.090
The internet can be a really divided place. It can be really brutal, scary,

259
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.300
and volatile, but we always try to put as much good in the world as we can.

260
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.200
I think a lot of these results proved that a lot of good comes back. Yeah.

261
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.970
I was surprised at how warm and nice a lot of those responses were maybe not the

262
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.580
soy testosterone stuff, but they didn't know.

263
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.050
They don't know how much we don't care about that. Thank you for having us wide.

264
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:02.861
We are the dry guys.

265
00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:06.880
Go check out our movie and until next time get that graphite

266
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.820
or you gave it a try.
