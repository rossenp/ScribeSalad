1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>One of the cool things about the game is that we were trying to capture the feel</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.150
of the films. So what we've tried to do is build our,

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.990
our maps and our bowel structures so that they are generally plain aligned like

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:13.350
the film, but at the same time it's space. So you can do whatever you want.

5
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.430
So like as a bomber,

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.420
it is perfectly valid to fly upside down beneath the star destroyer and be

7
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:20.550
launching your bottoms upward into the base of the ship.

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.550
It lets you have a kind of having taken you to two in terms of feeling like star

9
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:25.710
Wars, but giving you a lot of control. Hi,

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.430
this is Ian Frazier creative director on star Wars squadrons. Hi.

11
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.420
<v 1>I'm Shadi Melech lead UI artist on star Wars squadrons.</v>

12
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.450
<v 0>And this is every star fighter it star Wars squadrons,</v>

13
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.010
Fundamentally star Wars. Squadrons is a game about being a pilot,

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.230
a combat pilot in the star Wars universe.

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.380
So you're going to get into iconic ships like the X wing and the tie fighter

16
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.310
last round in five V five space battles, both in single-player.

17
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:58.850
We've got a story set after return of the Jedi and a multi-player where we have

18
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:00.140
two different competitive modes.

19
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.040
<v 1>So today we're going to look at all 10 playable ships and star Wars squadrons.</v>

20
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.940
We're going to have an in-depth look at their design gameplay and how we stay

21
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:08.774
true to the film.

22
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.590
<v 0>The fighter class is the multi-role class within star Wars quadrants.</v>

24
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.750
So these are the ships that are good at everything,

25
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:20.840
but they're not great at any one thing. If you want to be flexible,

26
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:24.620
able to switch back and forth between offense and defense fighters are where

27
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:25.454
it's at.

28
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.460
<v 1>The cool thing with typewriter is,</v>

29
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:31.730
is one of the ships where we have a lot of references from the films for any of

30
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.460
the eight ships. We would always start by the movies.

31
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.660
That's like the Holy grail.

32
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.010
We would supplement that by looking at schematics drawings and various manuals

33
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:44.840
that we had grabbing all of that we would do first concept art in

34
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.090
2d. So this is really just like in Photoshop,

35
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.970
grabbing different parts and moving them around rescaling dumb,

36
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.830
addressing all our gameplay needs,

37
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.880
but making sure that we stayed true to star Wars aesthetic and the vehicle

38
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:58.190
specific character. So for the tie fighter,

39
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.580
it's a ship that actually does have already a nice big central screen.

40
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.300
And we just had to kind of manipulate a few elements that were already existing

41
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:08.600
in the cockpit to go and create the extra gameplay elements we needed.

42
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.490
<v 0>We tried to act like we were income. Like we were assigned our fleet systems.</v>

43
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:16.580
Like we were the fictional companies within the star Wars universe that builds

44
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.250
these ships. We're looking at it partially as game developers,

45
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.730
but partially also from a purely fictional lens and going well,

46
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.950
have you had to really build one of these ships for real?

47
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.090
What would you do running this mixture between the films and trying to capture

48
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:29.870
the prop,

49
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.020
but then knowing that the prop is a prop and then looking at what it would take

50
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:34.790
to really fly one of these things.

51
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.590
And then finally knowing that only it's a game.

52
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.240
So there's constraints around that as well.

53
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.480
We tried to take all those things together to end up with the result that you

54
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:44.590
see today. The biggest challenge with getting the Thai fighter to,

55
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:48.530
to play the way that we wanted was simply that the design of it is actually

56
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.810
built around this sort of PO porthole window, right?

57
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.290
You have this front facing window that everything's focused around and we need

58
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.690
to make sure the player has enough vision, frankly.

59
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.250
So there was a lot of playing with the distance between where that window is,

60
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:03.940
where the control column is, where your seat is, so that both in 2d,

61
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.080
and of course in VR,

62
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.260
that the amount of visibility you have there is this kind of maximized,

63
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.250
or we keep the iconic look, fun fact, as we were working on it,

64
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.190
we ran into a problem. The Thai fighter interior,

65
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.340
where the struts are in the window, don't match the exterior.

66
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.380
There was actually a production error in the new hope.

67
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.260
So the inside of the tie doesn't match up with the outside.

68
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:25.960
The angle of the threats is different. We had to decide which,

69
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.670
which of these is going to be correct. Of course,

70
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:31.360
being a pilot game focused within the cockpit. We chose the cockpit view.

71
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.700
<v 1>We needed for gameplay to have additional screens. So we have a central console,</v>

72
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.860
but we've got a lot of gameplay components.

73
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.320
We didn't want it to be too DUI overlay.

74
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.010
We want players to have that pilot fantasy of really using the instruments that

75
00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:45.990
are in the ship. We had to add screens.

76
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.810
We were looking at reference that was outside the period.

77
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.550
And if you look at the first order ties,

78
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.820
they have these arms inside with these triangular screens.

79
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.130
The discussion we had from there was like, well, you know,

80
00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:57.870
this is not the right time period, not the right model.

81
00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:58.920
We don't want to go there,

82
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.270
but could we maybe imagine that there is a prototype of it that's already around.

83
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.230
<v 0>Timeline?</v>

84
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.500
That's one of the nice things with our time period is we're right after indoor.

85
00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:10.260
So both sides are kind of reappraising what they're doing a little bit.

86
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.680
And we see some interesting technology evolve that makes sense fictionally with

87
00:04:13.681 --> 00:04:16.140
the tie specifically, you'll notice that in the prologue,

88
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.660
which is set around the same time period as the first film,

89
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.240
you don't have any missiles. You don't have any countermeasures.

90
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:23.670
You have the basic lasers engines, Thai fighter,

91
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.180
but then when we jumped forward to the post end or period where most of the game

92
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.990
has set, now that the tightened squadron, the Imperial group that you're with,

93
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.990
they start experimenting with these shifts and trying things that are a little

94
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:34.824
bit more out there.

95
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.980
So you're going to get some non-stock options for weapons and components and

96
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:40.050
stuff. Once you get into that later time period,

97
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.470
the X wing and the tie fighter needed to be quite different.

98
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.240
This is the game that we've tried to balance,

99
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:48.570
but balance in an asymmetric way because each faction fictionally kind of has

100
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:49.770
its own strengths and weaknesses.

101
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.110
And we wanted to lean into those and actual game play.

102
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.930
The nice thing the X wing has is it's got all three systems,

103
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.681
it's got its engines,

104
00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:59.250
it's got its lasers and it's got shields that you can shift those double front

105
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:01.620
or behind you something, you know, we've heard in the films,

106
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.790
but then the tie fighters canonically don't have shields at all. So we said,

107
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:07.980
okay, what do we do to make that fair,

108
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.920
to get to kind of balance these two ships out, but have similar roles,

109
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:14.160
but are on opposite factions. And we need to keep, uh, more or less lined up.

110
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.280
If you fly the two in our game, the X wing feels a bit heavier.

111
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:20.820
It's got a bit more substance to it. The Thai fighter has a zippier turns.

112
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.520
It's just a faster ship and a more easily maneuverable ship.

113
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.970
And so that helps kind of counterbalance the shields in and of itself.

114
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.110
But the ability to control the shields to put them to front or back is giving

115
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:33.870
another edge to the X wing. So how do we counter that?

116
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.620
What we do is we use the same buttons that we would use for shield control on

117
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.590
the next wing, on a tie fighter. And some of the other ties,

118
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.020
we use that for emergency power conversion,

119
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.040
which is the ability to pull all the juice out of your engines and dump them

120
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.590
into your lasers or vice versa on the fly.

121
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.740
So you can quickly get out of trouble or quickly juice up your weapons for a

122
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:55.800
massive attack in a hurry in a way that the rebel ships can't.

123
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.010
Some of the things we to do for the X.

124
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.030
<v 1>Wing were, uh, changing the viewport kind of slimming down the struts a bit.</v>

125
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.860
It's a bunch of invisible changes that make it feel like the movie I had to take

126
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:11.000
the existing dashboard and, you know, its angular shape and how, how high it is.

127
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.781
That's iconic.

128
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:16.100
So we obviously have to have that we penned and scaled and kind of moved around

129
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.690
to create additional room.

130
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.410
So we'd be able to fit all the gameplay components for each of these changes.

131
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:24.050
Basically it's a slide in the deck showing the original,

132
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.640
showing the intended change and justifying why, but any changes we were doing,

133
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.520
you know, using the materials that were already in the cockpit, you know,

134
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.970
paint or icons or buttons that came from elsewhere and just making sure

135
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:37.850
everything was really authentic to that, that can shift.

136
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.530
<v 0>Like real things, right? So both from the fictional standpoint,</v>

137
00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:46.300
but also as prompts from the films we would ask, okay, it's 1977, your ILM,

138
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:47.110
you're building a prop.

139
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.020
You don't have a flat LCD screen and those don't exist yet.

140
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.160
You're going to notice that the lights for your laser charge or actual LEDs,

141
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.070
old-style like a little bowl with a plastic coating over it.

142
00:06:57.071 --> 00:07:00.070
That's coloring the light. It's one of those things that makes the game,

143
00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:03.790
I think, feel more real because the teams tried to approach it as if it is real.

144
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.540
<v 1>If we were making just any ship just for the game, you know,</v>

145
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:10.430
from a player experience standpoint, you're gonna put the,

146
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.130
the UI element exactly where you needed the size you,

147
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.440
that you need it in this case,

148
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.290
the fantasy is being a pilot in the star Wars universe.

149
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.640
So it doesn't make sense to do that.

150
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.370
You'd be sacrificing the whole fantasy that, you know,

151
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:24.160
we're trying to offer players because you're just trying to be as efficient as

152
00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:24.940
possible.

153
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.570
Even once we had the UI there with the right color scheme and everything looking

154
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:30.610
great in the retro, it still wasn't enough.

155
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.430
We wanted players to feel like they were really there.

156
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.850
So working with shader artists, we went and did materials.

157
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.290
We went to the point of being able to emulate the screen resolution for each

158
00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:41.830
display,

159
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.520
having a refresh rates and keeping the frame rate down to give that retro

160
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:47.350
choppiness, you know, like to the animation.

161
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.810
<v 0>So how do we create the sense that these ships are real?</v>

162
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.780
The first thing we did was the flight model for the X wing and Thai fighter.

163
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.090
And everything's really been built upon that foundation.

164
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.940
And what we've tried to do with them is look at everything we see in the films

165
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.910
and even some of the animated series and so on to look at what are the

166
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:04.060
boundaries? What are these ships capable of? What are they not capable of?

167
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.000
For instance, there's no vertical thrusters on next plane.

168
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.730
They don't go straight up and down. It's not a thing that X winds do.

169
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.430
So we did not want that as part of our flight model because it doesn't fit the

170
00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:16.570
fiction. At the same time, we wanted to create the idea of kind of world war II.

171
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.270
Combat piloting is our foundation as it was for Lucasfilm.

172
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.790
And then from there go, how do we up that a notch?

173
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.970
How do we take things like power management and eventually boosts and the drift

174
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:28.150
maneuver to take it and really take advantage of the fact that you're in space

175
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.070
and we can do some cool over the top stuff.

176
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.330
We ended up building an entirely new entity to handle how our ships work within

177
00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:35.200
the frostbite engine,

178
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.350
because we knew we were trying to do something that had never been done before

179
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.360
in our engine, quite like what we're doing.

180
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.640
We base it a lot off of the older games,

181
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:45.640
like original X wing and Thai fighter use that as a starting point, uh,

182
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.520
in terms of the kind of banking maneuvers we wanted to have in terms of how we

183
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:51.850
wanted them to handle turns. And so on, we did that as a foundation early on,

184
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:55.650
and then we started layering things in like power management and eventually drip

185
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.820
maneuver and legends.

186
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.240
There was this idea in star Wars of the etheric rudder and this idea that there

187
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.180
was some kind of medium in space that you actually kind of piloted through,

188
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.600
which was sort of the fictional reasoning behind ships handling more like

189
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.750
aircraft, less like spacecraft. Now, honestly,

190
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.720
I don't even know if that's Canon anymore or not. In terms of our,

191
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.780
our thinking around how we make the ships move.

192
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.960
It helps as a visual representation of how ships would move through media.

193
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.090
<v 1>These are the ships that are meant to go after other Starfighters.</v>

194
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.720
So they're the most agile and fast, and they really pack a punch.

195
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.540
They're also the most fragile. So you have to watch out,

196
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.340
they're not meant to go after capital ships,

197
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.970
when going about designing the time receptor, the idea was at the tie fighter,

198
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.660
the interceptor and into bomber, or they're part of the same line.

199
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.220
And when you're flying Imperial,

200
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.130
there's a certain standard and there is efficiency in the design,

201
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.030
but we did still want each ship to have its own unique character.

202
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.990
The way we did that for the interceptor, it's a ship that's made the hunt,

203
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.680
but it's also more fragile. So it's a little details. Like if you look at the,

204
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:58.880
the viewport, the spokes, and then the rim around there, thinner, more refined,

205
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.880
giving it a more precise look, but also a bit more fragile.

206
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.570
And the other big thing that we were able to use were those screens that we were

207
00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:07.580
adding on the side that we spoke about earlier.

208
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.340
So each of the three ships got a custom shape.

209
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.030
The one for the interceptor are these kind of aggressive triangles.

210
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.880
They kind of cement, its look as, you know, a hundred.

211
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.390
<v 0>So one of the most fun parts of working on the cockpits for squadrons was</v>

212
00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:22.910
figuring out how you actually fly a tie fighter.

213
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.440
And this is true for the fighter,

214
00:10:24.441 --> 00:10:27.590
the interceptor and the bomber is that if you look at the films,

215
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.910
we see very little of the actual interior of those ships and how physically you

216
00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:34.640
control it now, an X wing, uh, it's a joystick,

217
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.500
but with the time we see that there's a yoke,

218
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.480
but it's not really clear how that works.

219
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.870
And so we've ended up with this design around the pushing and pulling what it

220
00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:44.180
does when you twist, like what's a pitch, what's a yall.

221
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:47.420
How do you roll one of these ships and make sure that what we do does it

222
00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:48.920
contradict what we see in the films,

223
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.190
but is internally consistent and makes sense from a player standpoint.

224
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.420
So if you're playing the game,

225
00:10:53.421 --> 00:10:56.810
especially if you're in VR and you look down at what your pilot's hands are

226
00:10:56.811 --> 00:11:00.410
doing, it always makes sense. So when we, we built the ties, uh,

227
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.590
part of figuring out how they would control was sort of the physicality of it.

228
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.340
So we actually built simple wooden armatures that were the controls,

229
00:11:07.341 --> 00:11:09.590
like kind of imagine the yoke of the tie fighter.

230
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.340
So that then when we did motion capture performance capture of our actors for

231
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:16.550
cinematics, they were sitting inside these simple, you know,

232
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.300
wooden cockpits and then would work on the motions.

233
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.360
We're having a lot of fun with it.

234
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.840
So one of the things that makes the tie still very distinctive from the new

235
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:25.280
Republic ships and the Thai,

236
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.700
interceptors probably the best example of this is actually the sound design.

237
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.500
So those core mechanics of, you know,

238
00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:33.290
throttling your engine and that sweet spot in the middle of the throttle where

239
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:35.720
you turn better, those are the same between the factions.

240
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.410
But the way we treat that from an audio standpoint is quite different. You know,

241
00:11:39.411 --> 00:11:41.420
if you're in a rebel ship, if you listen to it,

242
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.160
there's rattles and clanks and clunks,

243
00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.920
and there's this distinct feeling that there's duct tape somewhere behind you

244
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:46.910
holding that ship together.

245
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.890
Whereas the ties it's, it's clean, it's pristine, precise,

246
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.130
especially with the interceptor, you're going to notice higher pitch.

247
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.300
You're going to notice more kind of clean hums, very little noise in the mix.

248
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.860
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

249
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.340
<v 0>The whole idea is that these things are engineered to perfection and that's,</v>

250
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.810
you're, you're experiencing kind of, you know,

251
00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:12.390
the Imperial cleanliness and design there.

252
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.660
The alien is one of my favorite ships in all of star Wars.

253
00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:19.080
So we had a lot of fun developing it and it has that very aerodynamic shape.

254
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.200
This thing is just, you know, kind of a wind flying through space. And yeah,

255
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.520
I know there's no air in space,

256
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.540
but there's always that sensation that this thing is incredibly fast at the same

257
00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:30.300
time, it's pretty small. And you have that, that feel that, you know,

258
00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:32.730
one straight blaster bolts gonna make your day real bad.

259
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.450
And we wanted to capture that in all of the tuning and design around the way.

260
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.110
<v 1>You'll look at the rebel ships and you'll notice that they use different fonts.</v>

261
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.990
So we have all these fonts that are from the end of the universe that you've

262
00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:44.400
seen on screen in the movies.

263
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.180
We've used them in different combinations to help the character of each ship

264
00:12:48.181 --> 00:12:50.490
kind of feel a bit different. It takes, you know,

265
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.510
a team of experts to bring the ships to the players like this.

266
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.450
<v 0>One of the things that's fun in the game is we've been really careful with our</v>

267
00:12:57.451 --> 00:12:58.890
collision, the actual collision,

268
00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:01.710
geometry around all this sort of stuff you could smash into in the game.

269
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.500
And as a result, if you're in an, a wing,

270
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.610
you can pretty easily fly into say the trench on the side of a star destroyer

271
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.380
flying to that area. That's super tight,

272
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.480
but that's a place where you can legitimately get in there,

273
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.930
potentially lose a pursuer as they might be a bit bigger and smash off the side.

274
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.460
We wanted to lean into that idea of being super fast, super agile,

275
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.380
but small. And you hit like a truck.

276
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.700
So you could have this crazy experience of being very cautious as everything

277
00:13:26.701 --> 00:13:28.590
around you can cause your death pretty easily,

278
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.870
but being able to get in and out and do these awesome,

279
00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:33.600
hidden fade attacks and just make you feel like an ACE.

280
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.360
<v 1>The cockpit is pretty cramped as well. In VR,</v>

281
00:13:36.361 --> 00:13:40.500
we had to make a few modifications. There's like this metal rim, right?

282
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.090
That like runs kind of across like the glass and where it was positioned in the

283
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.080
Canon ship.

284
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.890
It would be in the way of some of the instruments that the player needs to use.

285
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.150
So we had to move it and thin it and kind of play with that a bit while still

286
00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:57.000
giving you the impression that it's the same position, the same look,

287
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.030
even being able to let you personalize it, like hanging flair,

288
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.580
but not like intrude upon the gameplay elements.

289
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.450
<v 0>Well,</v>

290
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.200
if this is a real ship that existed and you got a fuzzy walk that you wanted to

291
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:08.610
put in in the real world,

292
00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:11.880
somebody would sell an attachment to actually hook those things up.

293
00:14:11.881 --> 00:14:12.714
And so that's what we did.

294
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.220
<v 1>So if you look down and it's just like that classic world war two cockpit stuff</v>

295
00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:19.740
that you'd, you'd expect to see, it's just a great look.

296
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.630
It's the only ship that has a radial speed gauge with an

297
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:26.520
arrow that actually moves up and down.

298
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.690
And it just gives it that feeling of speed, like almost like a muscle car,

299
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.210
you know? So yeah, I really enjoyed working on the wing.

300
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.080
<v 0>The bombers are defined by being a bit slower, but heavier a bit.</v>

301
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.960
Tackier built to drop that massive ordinance.

302
00:14:39.961 --> 00:14:41.880
That's going to take out big capital ships,

303
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.340
things like star destroyers and MC 70 fives.

304
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.550
So they might need a little support getting there, but once they get there,

305
00:14:47.551 --> 00:14:52.100
they can do an obscene amount of damage for the bomber. We wanted to make it.

306
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.870
<v 1>Look different than the interceptor and fighter,</v>

307
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.140
because it has a very different role. And the exterior is also very different.

308
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:59.720
So we needed to bring that insight as well for the player.

309
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.170
Our job was made easier because the bomber is a bigger ship.

310
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.510
So especially when you're looking around the interior,

311
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:09.140
you'll see there's actually room where people can sit behind you and all that's

312
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:12.260
designed. It looks very different than the interior from the other two ships.

313
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.780
Even if you look to the side, you will see that there's,

314
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.570
there's a door and there was the ordinance. You know,

315
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.210
you got all the bombs on the other side and the compartment.

316
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.300
So it makes it already feel quite different just from that.

317
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.820
You can actually go against the capital ships with it.

318
00:15:25.821 --> 00:15:29.210
You can make serious damage. It needed to feel tank here,

319
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.140
kind of the reverse approach that we had for the interceptor, for the bomber.

320
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:37.700
We went and made the frames of the viewport, thicker more armored,

321
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.370
kind of like he could Ram something and really take a lot of punishment.

322
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.130
Once again, those secondary screens that we introduced,

323
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.480
we gave it a different shape for the bomber or something bulkier to just kind of

324
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:48.830
confirmed its role on the team.

325
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:49.181
<v 0>Well,</v>

326
00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.270
the ships that have the off center cockpit like the bomber or the tie Reaper are

327
00:15:52.271 --> 00:15:54.310
quite challenging because as a player,

328
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.400
you don't want to feel like all your control is offset by, you know,

329
00:15:57.401 --> 00:16:00.100
a meter or two from where the ship's actually located.

330
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.340
It becomes incredibly hard to tell, like, can I get through that hole?

331
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.950
I don't know. Where is the hole relative to me?

332
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.930
So what we ended up doing is we have the,

333
00:16:07.931 --> 00:16:10.000
the pilot's seat is technically off center,

334
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.100
but the pivot point for the ship has been moved relative to the,

335
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:15.070
the broader shape of the ship effectively,

336
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.140
or you're driving it from the center of the ship,

337
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.180
even though your seat is a little offset,

338
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.810
but what we do to make the ships feel weighty is largely playing with the tuning

339
00:16:22.811 --> 00:16:25.210
of their engines. So how fast they accelerate,

340
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.020
how fast they decelerate and how much momentum they preserve when you go into a

341
00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:29.770
different maneuver,

342
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.980
if you're in a bomber and you start to turn the degree to which you have forward

343
00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:36.160
momentum, there helps sell that sense that it's actually kind of a heavy ship.

344
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.880
Obviously the top end speed relative to other ships also helps that sense of

345
00:16:39.881 --> 00:16:41.530
weight. And there's a lot of, uh,

346
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.000
kind of tricks of presentation that help it doesn't make a bit of difference in

347
00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:48.160
the way the ship handles, but in your mind that that sensation,

348
00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:52.270
that it's a kind of beef, your ship helps make it feel slower, feel weightier.

349
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.220
Similarly with the sound design,

350
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.460
when we're using a lot of lower pitches that helps kind of correlate your mind

351
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.640
with the slower BP or stronger ship, uh,

352
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.820
than the more like high-pitched tightly tuned interceptors.

353
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.870
So the Y wing has been a really interesting challenge for us because we're

354
00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:09.790
trying to capture the feel of the ship.

355
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.120
And it's got a lot of similarities with the XYZ in terms of its structure and

356
00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:16.180
cockpit, but you still want it to feel distinctive the cockpit.

357
00:17:16.181 --> 00:17:18.610
Team's done a great job of looking at the instrumentation,

358
00:17:18.611 --> 00:17:21.850
looking at the shape language that you see within that dashboard in the film,

359
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.010
and then trying to make use of that as well as possible,

360
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.700
whether it's the kind of like tube that works its way over the instruments or

361
00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:29.770
the actual shapes you see of the instruments there,

362
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.050
we've tried to make use of those and really lean into them.

363
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.720
So it feels right for a while at the same time,

364
00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.870
kind of that heavy structure you have around you are kind of left and right

365
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:38.530
behind you,

366
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.410
you have a lot less of a window to your astronomic than you would in say an

367
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.220
x-ray.

368
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.640
<v 1>It's really interesting with the wiling because it's one of the oldest ships</v>

369
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.520
that the rebels have. You can definitely see it in the design.

370
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.440
So it was quite a challenge for us to design something that would keep its

371
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:57.120
unique character, but make it playable because the ship is devoid of screens.

372
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.810
For starters,

373
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.320
like the only one that you see in the movies is the targeting computer that

374
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:05.070
comes in from the side. But besides that, it doesn't actually have any displays.

375
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.780
It's kind of like harkens back to the Saifai ships that had basically blinking

376
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:12.720
lights and these huge computers, right? With like lovers and blinking lights.

377
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.610
You look at the wiring of the cabin for a pilot.

378
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.820
It's been a first file ship over different time periods.

379
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.400
And we've even seen it have two,

380
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.580
two people in there having the pilot and then having like a rear gunner.

381
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.070
So it's a very long cabin. And, uh,

382
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:30.090
the pilot is kind of sitting with his legs out a bit more compared to some of

383
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:31.920
the other ships we had to play, you know,

384
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:35.010
with like the dimensions and do a bunch of tricks to make it feel like the

385
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:38.340
shots, especially with the ones you see in episode four, but like make it,

386
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.150
make it playable.

387
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.350
So one of the things we did was bring in displays that we'd designed for the

388
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:47.430
x-ray and layered them with some of the iconic things that were the wiring,

389
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.940
like the tube and dent that cone with the glass lens that we use for the ship

390
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.010
status indicator, even on the screens,

391
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.760
I paid close attention to the patterns that you have on those side panels.

392
00:18:56.761 --> 00:19:00.900
So the painting patterns and those big grip, glass lights that kind of stroke,

393
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.750
we took those patterns and we made vector versions of them.

394
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.380
And we use them as backing for the information under this place was quite a

395
00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:10.620
challenge to be able to try and keep that look,

396
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.610
but introduce screens without, uh, you know, kind of disfiguring the way.

397
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.520
<v 0>But why wing for the longest time has been our example of how you make two very</v>

398
00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:23.570
different bills using components by default, they're built to be bombers.

399
00:19:23.571 --> 00:19:26.210
They're built to be really good at taking down enemy capital ships,

400
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.970
not as good dogfighting depending on the components.

401
00:19:28.971 --> 00:19:32.510
You can slant them very heavily toward you're taking out capital shifts and just

402
00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:35.600
accept that you're going to be awful in a dog fight and need the support of your

403
00:19:35.601 --> 00:19:36.434
friends,

404
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.070
or you can slant some more the other way and be more of a heavy assault craft,

405
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.680
where you're never going to be as Zippy as an eight wing.

406
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.810
And it's going to be trouble with people, get on your tail.

407
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.850
But if they're dumb enough to come at you from the front,

408
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.290
you can really end their day in a hurry.

409
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.730
<v 1>What makes a ship part of the support class is that you'll be piloting it to</v>

410
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.830
help your friends and hinder your enemies.

411
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.250
So you're going to have a bunch of tricks up your sleeve that kind of gives you

412
00:19:58.251 --> 00:20:00.350
the edge and slow down your enemies.

413
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.330
<v 0>Tie Reaper in the Ewing,</v>

414
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.970
both of our support ships actually come from the film rogue one,

415
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.280
and we were really excited to bring them to life in the game because they

416
00:20:07.281 --> 00:20:10.160
haven't had as much exposure yet. The Reaper in particular, just,

417
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.690
you got to love that design. So cool.

418
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.020
I think it's probably my favorite ship on the Imperial side. Originally,

419
00:20:15.021 --> 00:20:18.770
we looked at support and we said, okay, we want kind of the entry-level class,

420
00:20:18.771 --> 00:20:20.450
the class, that's going to be the easiest to use.

421
00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:24.860
It can be helpful for your team, but isn't as effective at killing did not work,

422
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.150
uh, for a couple of reasons.

423
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.570
First is that the X wing of the tie fighter or what everybody knows.

424
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.010
So no matter what we do,

425
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.100
those are going to be the ships that anybody new or more casual is going to

426
00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:37.670
gravitate toward. The other thing is we found that in a dog fighter simply,

427
00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:38.000
you know,

428
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.210
hunting down enemies and shooting them is the most basic thing you can do.

429
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.490
That is the most successful and fundamental part of gameplay.

430
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.850
We ended up pivoting our mindset for support ships,

431
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.960
to be less the entry-level ship, and actually the other way around.

432
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.810
They're more of a high-level ship that takes a bit more skill to use

433
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:54.880
effectively, but they're the specialists.

434
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.440
You can use a tie Reaper to sort of Batten down the hatches around your area to

435
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:02.320
put up turrets drop mines, to defend the zone.

436
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.710
You can do it to make your entire team invisible, to enemy radar,

437
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.480
to ionize enemy shields and bring them down to, to, uh, you know, focus fire.

438
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.200
They're very versatile in terms of what they can do with the widest array of

439
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:15.520
different components that can be equipped.

440
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.730
<v 1>We were bringing a ship to the screen,</v>

441
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.430
especially it's a cockpit that no one had seen yet.

442
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.590
So the outside has been seen, but like what,

443
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.030
this was going to be news our players,

444
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:28.440
there were some models that existed because the ship was designed for use for

445
00:21:28.441 --> 00:21:31.950
Jedi fallen order. Our biggest consideration was, uh,

446
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.870
visibility from the ship. We kind of cut the dashboard down and made it shorter.

447
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.630
So the pilot could sit closer to the front windows.

448
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.690
They still look like what you expect when you're seeing it from the outside.

449
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.290
But once again, you know, like little, little tricks, uh,

450
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.450
we make it more accessible for players.

451
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.300
<v 0>Working on the UN has been interesting because as you may know,</v>

452
00:21:51.301 --> 00:21:52.590
it's a two-seater craft.

453
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.040
And so trying to balance your perspective in a way that feels right,

454
00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:58.860
that feels like you're in the, you know, left-hand seat across the front there,

455
00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.340
but also pilots in a way you expect where it's not difficult to fly through a

456
00:22:02.341 --> 00:22:04.260
hole in a structure because, Oh,

457
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.770
actually my center point is over there has been really challenging trying to

458
00:22:07.771 --> 00:22:08.291
make sure that,

459
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:11.340
that our physics lines up with kind of what your brain expects as a pilot,

460
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.180
especially in VR versus the actual center point of the ship.

461
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.010
The other big challenge is, as you may know,

462
00:22:17.011 --> 00:22:19.770
is that the Ewing has S foils its wings unfold.

463
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.710
So when you wing is jumping into hyperspace,

464
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.410
you've got the wings locked and it's in its iconic U shape.

465
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.950
But once you're ready for combat, they fall back into more of a frankly,

466
00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:33.250
a Y shape, but don't tell the why wings for combat. And that means that their,

467
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.920
their breadth is quite a bit bigger.

468
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.950
So if you're flying through say the interior of a space station, you've got,

469
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.680
gotta be a lot more aware of your surroundings and that you mean that you might

470
00:22:40.681 --> 00:22:44.700
need to in something like in any way, with both the Ewing and the Reaper, uh,

471
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.020
they have places in them to have,

472
00:22:46.021 --> 00:22:48.420
whether it's a copilot or passengers in the back.

473
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.450
And if you look inside them in the game, you do see those seats,

474
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.020
but we don't actually have them filled now partially that's because our game is

475
00:22:55.021 --> 00:22:57.410
set in space. You're not landing on planets.

476
00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.130
Wouldn't have anywhere to drop them off.

477
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.990
Not a lot of reason for them to be there fictionally,

478
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.950
but also because from a performance standpoint, the way the game runs,

479
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.830
we're trying to make sure we're giving you the things that matter the most and

480
00:23:07.831 --> 00:23:09.060
giving all the attention there.

481
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.430
So the ships and lasers and explosions that are in front of you,

482
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.030
if we have a high fidelity character, two feet away from you,

483
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.850
everything out of the window is going to have to look worse in order to make

484
00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:20.070
performance space for that character right next to you.

485
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.510
<v 1>Working on the wing was easier for two reasons. One,</v>

486
00:23:24.511 --> 00:23:27.180
because it's one of the later ships I tackled in production.

487
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.630
So we were already getting really used to finding creative solutions that a

488
00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:34.620
challenge that we faced on the other ships also as luck would have it just the

489
00:23:34.621 --> 00:23:38.040
design would that big central screen. And it has all that, you know,

490
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:42.510
the mess of wires and connectors, and it has a secondary monitor on a swivel.

491
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.770
I was able to just take that monitor, move it elsewhere,

492
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:48.230
where it fit with the order that we have four components,

493
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:51.800
because every ship is different, but gameplay wise, you know, he want people to,

494
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.750
to know that the radar is going to be over on the left.

495
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:56.120
The speed's going to be on the left because it fits with the controller,

496
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:56.930
that kind of stuff.

497
00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.160
So that let us easily move it around without having to modify it as much.

498
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.840
So what we did for the Ewing is more rescale and move around existing elements.

499
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.660
And we were able to quickly find a home for, uh,

500
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.780
for most of our gameplay components. Uh, I think for the most part,

501
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:16.220
I only had to modify the top part of the central console.

502
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.460
So it would, uh, it would be able to display our load out.

503
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.770
And we use something that is existing, that you saw,

504
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.020
like this kind of glass part with red lights in the movie,

505
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.860
it was close enough to our laser bar. So it was a really a good fit.

506
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.110
<v 0>So we've added these two new ships at the time defender and the BYU.</v>

507
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.560
He designed the game around the eight core playable ships. But fortunately,

508
00:24:35.561 --> 00:24:36.850
thanks to all the support of our players,

509
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.570
we're able to add these entirely new ships that fill new niches within the game

510
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.070
play. And they're going to add a lot to the game.

511
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.740
<v 1>Even though the ships are a part of existing classes,</v>

512
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.820
they play very differently.

513
00:24:45.821 --> 00:24:48.850
They're quite unique and they get their own unique components as well.

514
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.660
<v 0>A big part of the design of squadrons is about team composition and the way that</v>

515
00:24:52.661 --> 00:24:55.480
you kind of lag your team and the way that you support each other, like, okay,

516
00:24:55.481 --> 00:24:58.060
you know, I'm going to need some people that are handling just enemy ships.

517
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.550
And it needs people that are focusing on the objectives. And so on.

518
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.230
If we added a whole new class,

519
00:25:02.231 --> 00:25:06.220
like we call them the heavier something that compositional picture got a bit

520
00:25:06.221 --> 00:25:07.900
more complicated. So instead we went,

521
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.500
how do we fit these into the existing kind of roles that we have,

522
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:16.030
but offset enough in that kind of spectrum of design that they all feel unique.

523
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.910
We don't want the tie defender to feel like a it's a tie fighter with a

524
00:25:18.911 --> 00:25:20.740
different cockpit. You want it to feel distinctive,

525
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.170
but we still want to understand the role that, okay,

526
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.610
this is a flexible ship that can be used both offensively and defensively in the

527
00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:30.970
way that a tie fighter I'm a big fan of it from the tie fighter days,

528
00:25:30.971 --> 00:25:32.230
like the PC game tie fighter.

529
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.410
We were so excited to see that come back into Canon and went okay, well,

530
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.820
we've got to let people fly this thing.

531
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.970
The reason we put it in that kind of fighter class is that it is meant to be

532
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.790
flux. It's something that can help offensively defensively,

533
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:47.410
where it's a bit different than say the tie fighter or tie interceptor is it's

534
00:25:47.411 --> 00:25:49.060
really good within a given area.

535
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.020
It's not as good at getting from point to point heavily leans on boosts and

536
00:25:53.021 --> 00:25:56.440
drift for all your maneuverability. So you can really hold a spot,

537
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.800
but if you need kind of superiority over the large space to hold the front,

538
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.430
you don't want to rely just some defenders,

539
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.100
mix that up with the different teams.

540
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:08.200
<v 1>So the tie defender being part of the same line as the tie fighter bomber or</v>

541
00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:11.860
interceptor, obviously has to have a lot of things in common with them.

542
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:16.270
That's kind of the point of that series for the pilots to just hop in your home.

543
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.410
All the ships in the series,

544
00:26:17.411 --> 00:26:21.370
the main difference was the viewport and also the secondary monitors that we

545
00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:24.760
have on both sides of that central column, that standard and all of them.

546
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.460
So the Thai defender still has that console in the middle,

547
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.500
and it has its own set of handles on the side.

548
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.560
One big thing with a tight offender is it has shields.

549
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.560
So it means it has more power management going on.

550
00:26:35.561 --> 00:26:39.250
And it also has more information that you need to be able to consult as a

551
00:26:39.251 --> 00:26:40.720
player, as we're flying that, that ship.

552
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.030
We had fun playing with different shapes and patterns.

553
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.920
We found one that boat felt robust enough to kind of feel like this is a ship

554
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:48.930
that can take punishment, but also,

555
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.830
still felt aggressive a bit closer to the Ty interceptor than the bottom ones.

556
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.700
<v 0>We want it to look like the empire spend more money on the ship.</v>

557
00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.390
There's a little bit more technology going on a little bit more stuff built in

558
00:26:59.391 --> 00:27:01.100
compared to the other three cortex buyers.

559
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.760
<v 1>The ship status indicator. If you look at the other three basic ties,</v>

560
00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:05.810
besides the Reaper,

561
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.430
what we're showing you is a silhouette of the ship seen from the front because

562
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.910
the defender has shields. We want it to show you a top-down view.

563
00:27:13.911 --> 00:27:16.610
So it would be clear right off the back of your looking at your front and rear

564
00:27:16.611 --> 00:27:17.810
shields. I love it,

565
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:21.170
silhouette so aggressive and all those those spikes when you see it from the

566
00:27:21.171 --> 00:27:25.250
top. But it's also a very challenging shape to work with, uh,

567
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.900
for the UI to try and, you know,

568
00:27:26.901 --> 00:27:30.350
like surrounding with the shields and fit that nicely within the screen.

569
00:27:30.351 --> 00:27:34.910
So I spent quite a bit of time doing different iterations and

570
00:27:34.911 --> 00:27:38.150
patterns and, and line art to that would, uh,

571
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.850
that would really go well with the silhouette and still stay clear for me.

572
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.790
<v 0>In rebels, the tide offenders, just straight up,</v>

573
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.510
better than the other ties in the context of a competitive game that doesn't

574
00:27:47.511 --> 00:27:48.860
work grading. It's like, all right, well,

575
00:27:48.861 --> 00:27:51.320
you've got five ships take that one's totally superior.

576
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.940
So what we've done lore wise is that after Thrones initiative, uh, you know, uh,

577
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.540
spoilers the things go sideways on the fall that defender, uh,

578
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.570
initiatives put out a service, but the plans are still around.

579
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.750
So in our time period, when the empire is not doing so well,

580
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.420
the plans still exist, but they don't have the resources they once did.

581
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.290
So you're getting kind of a second generation more suited for mass production

582
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.900
version. The whole game was designed to make you feel like an ACE pilot,

583
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.580
but the defender is a whole other level.

584
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.870
Now the elite within the ACE pilot group, when I really master that ship,

585
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:21.763
which is a great feeling,

586
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.610
the cool thing about the B wing is it's the last ship from the return of the

587
00:28:25.611 --> 00:28:29.120
Jedi era that we wanted to bring to the light that we never got a chance to do

588
00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:29.930
with the core game.

589
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:34.130
So the B wing is really cool because it's got this unique gyroscopic cockpit.

590
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.080
You can actually keep your cockpit stable,

591
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.920
but control the entire rest of the ship around the cockpit. Now, partially,

592
00:28:39.921 --> 00:28:43.940
this is just cool, just for fun, but also you can be using this tactically.

593
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.920
So it's something that improves your missile evasion.

594
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:47.990
It's something you can use to aim your bombs.

595
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.080
So you can have your ship like aiming upward flight under a ship and shoot your

596
00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.180
bombs straight up, for example. And beyond that,

597
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.160
it actually is increasing the rest of your ammo. So if you take that component,

598
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.540
the one that lets you control your gyroscopic cockpit,

599
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.850
it's doubling whatever your other auxiliary does.

600
00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.480
<v 1>So we were wondering maybe we would only allow you to have it vertically or</v>

601
00:29:05.481 --> 00:29:09.350
horizontal, and it would just kind of ease by itself in between those motions.

602
00:29:09.351 --> 00:29:12.860
Once you triggered it, or we could allow total control, I'm pretty,

603
00:29:12.861 --> 00:29:15.710
pretty stoked that we were actually able to allow you granular controls.

604
00:29:15.711 --> 00:29:18.470
You can actually place it at any angle that you want. As you're piloting.

605
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.100
We decided to go kind of old school with a dial that looks like some something

606
00:29:22.101 --> 00:29:23.660
you'd have on an old fighter plane.

607
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.960
And you actually have a needle that's like a B wing silhouette shape.

608
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.070
And you see it rotate around the dial. So you get like this precise feedback.

609
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.600
<v 0>You got a bubble cockpit.</v>

610
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.090
So if you're doing free look or especially if you're in VR,

611
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.630
you can be just looking out the window is that as that big wing is moving.

612
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.670
<v 1>You'll sit like, you know, block out the light, like across your dashboard, you.</v>

613
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.350
<v 0>Feel the rumble of using your controller.</v>

614
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:47.560
And you've got that kind of a shuttering metal scraping sound.

615
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:50.320
As the entire ship moves around, you can be firing your lasers,

616
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.470
you're being Canon or whatever, while you're rotating the wing.

617
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:56.920
And so you see the lasers kind of spiraling around your cockpit as that's

618
00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:59.440
rotating, and you're still fire. The ship is ungainly.

619
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.380
You go flying into a tight tunnel, like in our new map, foster Haven,

620
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.930
you've got to really be paying attention to what are the constraints of that

621
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:07.530
ship? Are you just smack into a wall? And so having that,

622
00:30:07.531 --> 00:30:09.160
that level of situational awareness,

623
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.430
having the new instrumentation that lets you actually control and be aware of

624
00:30:12.431 --> 00:30:14.110
where the rest of your ship is, uh,

625
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:15.910
is a whole new kind of experience with the B wing.

626
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:17.620
That's really unlike anything else in the game.

627
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.290
<v 1>The references we had were mainly the ships were built for the original trilogy.</v>

628
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.500
So you've never seen them into movie like the inside,

629
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.860
but they were built like as part of that, that ship,

630
00:30:28.861 --> 00:30:31.710
they were using photos outside shots as they were flying through space.

631
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.120
And then, uh,

632
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.570
there was references from the rebels show for the prototype of the B wing.

633
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.210
<v 0>From a fictional standpoint, the blade wing was the prototype.</v>

634
00:30:39.211 --> 00:30:42.330
So what we're trying to capture is more of the standard B wing that comes along

635
00:30:42.331 --> 00:30:43.164
a bit later.

636
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.890
And also because there's just something cool about feeling like when you saw

637
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.910
return of the Jedi,

638
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.750
that cockpit was actually there and that'd be when you just couldn't quite see

639
00:30:51.751 --> 00:30:52.890
it because of the camera work.

640
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.740
And we're finally getting to sort of reveal that to the world, you know,

641
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.320
very much in first person for the first time, the BYU.

642
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.230
<v 1>Being one of the leaderships to be introduced,</v>

643
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.050
it's little subtle things that it will set it apart,

644
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.530
making the screens a bit higher resolution and playing, you know,

645
00:31:07.531 --> 00:31:11.130
with the type of CRT or LCD monitors you're seeing in some of the panels,

646
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.780
the beeping has a mix of like small CRTs for like it's radar and then it ships

647
00:31:15.781 --> 00:31:17.190
status indicator. Uh,

648
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.540
but then it does have a nice big LCD display for the combat screen,

649
00:31:21.541 --> 00:31:23.760
closer to what you'd see on the wing.

650
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.690
<v 0>So the B wing in lore is, is a bomber. You know, it's, it's a bomber clash,</v>

651
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.020
this whole craft, but being, being a great bomber is a big part of its identity.

652
00:31:31.021 --> 00:31:35.130
So we wanted to keep that concept. Um, but it's also such a unique shift.

653
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.920
You know, it's something that a lot of people love are fans of wanting to play.

654
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.620
We've got a lot of feedback if the feeling, where is it? Okay.

655
00:31:40.621 --> 00:31:42.270
We put it in guys. It's going to be okay.

656
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.870
It's that idea of being able to control your bombs specifically that from,

657
00:31:45.871 --> 00:31:48.120
from a mechanical standpoint, that, well, with the ship,

658
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.040
we thought that was such a good fit that it made.

659
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.070
It made sense to really lean into that bomber room. The other thing is,

660
00:31:53.071 --> 00:31:54.630
if you look at the design of our ships,

661
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.800
the Y wing has always been intended to be kind of a spectrum between going all

662
00:31:58.801 --> 00:32:01.290
bomber and more of a dog fighter or somewhere in between.

663
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.780
We give you quite a bit of flexibility with the B wing.

664
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.480
We've gone even further to the right, so it can dog fight,

665
00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.640
but at the most it's going to be a backline fighter.

666
00:32:08.641 --> 00:32:11.190
That's kind of providing it like artillery support.

667
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.720
Whereas on the other extreme,

668
00:32:12.721 --> 00:32:15.720
it is a bomber that is good for dropping bombs and nothing else.

669
00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:18.750
And you darn well better escort it in terms of team composition.

670
00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:22.320
The thing with the B wing is that it is the farthest thing over on the extreme

671
00:32:22.321 --> 00:32:25.710
of kind of the, I just murder people too. I just murder capital ships,

672
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.140
a spectrum of different shifts.

673
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.730
And so it's something that doesn't work well on its own is a ship that benefits

674
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.330
tremendously from being paired with the UN and to a lesser extent by being

675
00:32:36.331 --> 00:32:39.590
paired with other shifts that can support and protect it on way to the desk,

676
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.670
to the destination. Similarly, you can set it up to be more of a dog fighter,

677
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.170
but even in that case,

678
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:47.360
it's not going to be flying around in the middle of everything.

679
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:50.000
The way that an a wing would, it stays more at a distance.

680
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.510
And while everyone else is keeping the enemy busy, it just guns them down,

681
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:54.740
you know, tremendous artillery.

682
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.430
So it's very much a ship that leans into teamwork. Uh,

683
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.830
you don't want to run the wings without the support of your buddies.

684
00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:04.780
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

685
00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.900
<v 0>And that was every Starfighter in star Wars, squadrons.</v>

686
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.930
We hope this has helped you understand the game a little bit better and brought

687
00:33:10.931 --> 00:33:13.300
that galaxy far, far away, a little bit closer to home.
