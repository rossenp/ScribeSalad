00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.160
<v 0>When we eat animals like cows and pigs,</v>

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.390
our current food production system makes it so that over half the nutrition that

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:10.590
these animals could provide never even makes it to our plates. Hi,

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm Dr. Bill Schindler, food, archeologists,

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.590
chef and director of the Eastern shore food lab and Washington college.

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.150
The modern way that we approach eating animals is the most unhealthy unethical

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.340
and unsustainable. It has ever been.

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.310
Society is pretty much just focused on eating meat,

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.730
which is actually one of the least nutrient dense parts of the animal.

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.200
But unfortunately our current food production system prioritizes it while

11
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.530
wasting the more useful and nutritious parts today,

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.760
we're going to take a look at how animal consumption has ended up this way and

13
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:45.750
what we can try to do to fix it before we get into how things are now.

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.340
It's crucial to understand the role that animals played in our dietary past.

15
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520
Our ancestors began eating meat almost three and a half million years ago.

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.320
Prior to this time, our ancestors were eating leaves, fruits, vegetables,

17
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:02.820
and insects, but when they invented this tool, it completely changed the game.

18
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.810
This tool,

19
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.520
the Lamech way tool that dates to almost 3.3 million years ago was a

20
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:12.030
tool probably responsible for most of the butchering that was taking place at

21
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:12.660
that time.

22
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.510
Now our ancestors weren't hunting at three and a half million years ago.

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.320
In fact, they were scavenging and this is the tool that allowed them to do that.

24
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.080
Our first introduction to meat was an,

25
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:25.770
a predator would kill an animal in the African Savanna and then Gorge themselves

26
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.820
on the most nutrient dense bioavailable parts of that animal, the blood,

27
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.980
the Oregons and the fat after this,

28
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.600
our ancestors would scavenge the parts that were left behind the meat and the

29
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.434
marrow.

30
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.570
What's really interesting is that the introduction of meat into their diet did

31
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:45.300
not significantly change their body or brain size.

32
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.560
Everything changed around 2 million years ago when our ancestors first started

33
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:51.150
the hunt. When they started the hunt,

34
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.350
they climbed to the top of the food chain and became the predators themselves.

35
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.530
They no longer had to rely on just the leftover bits of me,

36
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.660
but instead had first access to the most nutrient dense and bioavailable

37
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:06.330
parts of the animal, the blood, the fat, and the organs,

38
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.050
and the influx of such incredible nutrition into their diets,

39
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.320
supported massive body and brain growth,

40
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.390
and essentially made us human from this point forward up until recent times,

41
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.800
almost all of our dietary changes, increased our connection to our food,

42
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.180
the nutrient density,

43
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.990
safety and bioavailability of the foods in our diets technologies,

44
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:31.200
just like this catapulted us to the top of the food chain.

45
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.240
And this continued to progress over millions of years until about 15,000 years

46
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:38.640
ago. At the beginning of the agriculture revolution,

47
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.790
when the focus of technologies began to change,

48
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.890
we went from diets that had hundreds of different plants and dozens of different

49
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:51.330
animals to a diet solely focused on a few annual grasses

50
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.920
technologies are now focused on things like privilege or wealth or

51
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:56.820
convenience.

52
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.810
And these very technologies that used to us and nourish us are ripping the

53
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.950
power away from us and have resulted in humans being the most

54
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.660
unhealthy they have ever been. Since most of us today, no longer hunts.

55
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.530
We don't have first access to the animals that we're consuming.

56
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.380
We are incredibly distanced from our food,

57
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.510
where it comes from and how it's made the modern food industry has complete

58
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:25.180
control over how we think about food.

59
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.190
Even what we consider food to be because meat ships and stores a

60
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.060
lot better than other parts of the animal like organs or blood.

61
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.910
The focus, the focus in the grocery stores.

62
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.140
The focus on marketing is on meat because of that.

63
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:44.680
We as consumers, when we even think about eating an animal,

64
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.960
we almost only think about eating the meat.

65
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.810
We've taken a step way too far back into the past.

66
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.620
We now as modern humans have become scavengers. Once again,

67
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.700
most of us only have access to the least valuable part of the animal.

68
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.290
This has resulted in addressing increase in obesity, coronary heart disease,

69
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.210
irritable bowel syndrome, and even diabetes. Our diets used to nourish us,

70
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.760
but now the food that we eat is making us sick.

71
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.590
Not many of us hunt or forage or butcher or

72
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:18.100
process or ferment or cook our own food.

73
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.080
We don't even know the people that do.

74
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.030
We don't directly know the farmer or the avatar or the

75
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:25.864
butcher,

76
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.770
or even the people that have placed the meat on the grocery store shelves.

77
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.581
At best.

78
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:34.150
We might know the person that checks us out at the cash register because of this

79
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:37.090
disconnect. We don't rely on our senses any longer.

80
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.100
We no longer smell or food or look at our food or feel our food or

81
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:46.960
taste our food for the purposes of trying to understand whether it's a food that

82
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:49.060
we should actually consume and put into our bodies.

83
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.710
There are some incredible ranchers and farmers that are part of an ethical,

84
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.490
sustainable and nursing food system. However,

85
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.490
most of the meat we eat today is not coming from them.

86
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.660
Huge factory farms have popped up all over the world.

87
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.310
That place animals in unhealthy unethical conditions kept

88
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:14.110
alive with drugs and are genetically engineered to grow so fast that their

89
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:15.370
bodies can't even keep up.

90
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.660
These animals are slaughtered en mass in a system that results in the meat,

91
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.350
making it to the grocery store shelves while the rest of the animal is used for

92
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.650
non-food purposes or worse even goes to waste.

93
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.510
Factory farming that focuses on quantity over quality has

94
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:35.560
rewritten the food chain. It is no longer about the individual family.

95
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.630
It is now about big corporations by focusing on meat and worse, lean meat,

96
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.250
we've excluded high quality animal fats and incredibly

97
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:48.670
nutritious, awful from our diets. In fact,

98
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:53.320
it has also changed our conscious about what a truly healthy diet is.

99
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.100
The modern world is deathly afraid of Fen. However,

100
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.780
animal fat, high quality,

101
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.520
nutritious bioavailable animal fat have literally

102
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:08.960
helped fuel our evolutionary changes for millions of years.

103
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.990
There is no for hair, feathers, scales,

104
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.090
or even skin in our home kitchens anymore.

105
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.480
Most of us don't even use bones or fat in our cooking.

106
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.550
This has powerful ramifications for our children who never get the opportunity

107
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:27.530
to make the connection between life animal death and

108
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:30.920
the food on their plates. If we don't do something about this, now,

109
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.740
all of these problems are going to continue to get worse.

110
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.480
The food system is going to fail and the future of our species is in jeopardy.

111
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.471
However,

112
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:44.420
it's not too late changes that you can make on an individual level can result

113
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.850
in the global change that we need. We need to,

114
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.060
re-introduce small local farms into our communities.

115
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.360
We need to bring back butchers into each and every town.

116
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.120
And we need to empower home chefs to butcher and cook from scratch for

117
00:06:59.121 --> 00:06:59.954
their families.

118
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.610
These changes remove the links from our food chain and

119
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:09.080
reconnect us with our food and where it comes from an incredibly powerful ways.

120
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.720
It places the power and responsibility of feeding our families back into our

121
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:18.740
hands and removes that control from the modern food system.

122
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.310
If all you do now is buy chicken breasts from the grocery store,

123
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.060
buy a whole chicken, bring it home, butcher it in front of your family.

124
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.040
Let them see skin, make bone broth from the bones, make pet hay from the liver,

125
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.810
cook the heart and eat it.

126
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.870
If you already buy a whole chicken from the grocery store instead,

127
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:40.220
go to the farmer's market or even better yet go to the farm and meet the farmer.

128
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.980
If you already do that, buy a half a pig,

129
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.390
bring it home and put it on your table. I'm serious. It is not disgusting.

130
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:49.850
It is not bloody. It is real.

131
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.230
Take that pig and make bacon, make sausage,

132
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.640
render the fat,

133
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.740
make poor cracklings and pork runs having this connection well more than

134
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.230
double the amount of nutrition that we get from each animal,

135
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.750
allow us to directly see and appreciate the consequences of our actions and put

136
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:12.110
us all in a more ethical and sustainable frame of mind.
