00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>When you guys can really play.</v>

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.240
<v 1>Hi everybody. I'm Marin Alsop.</v>

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.210
<v 0>Marin began conducting in 1980.</v>

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.350
She's currently the chief conductor of the Vienna radio symphony orchestra.

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.270
<v 1>Today I'll be breaking down clips from movies and TV about</v>

6
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:24.110
orchestras technique, Mr. Holland's Opus,

7
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.870
When he starts the piece,

8
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.880
it looks as though it's going to be a very quiet opening. Certainly not.

9
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.890
That could be good to get in the drums.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.300
You really have to set up the drums in a much bigger way.

11
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

12
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.030
<v 1>Another big issue I have with this clip is that I can't</v>

13
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:03.170
imagine any student orchestra playing at this level,

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.040
the high trumpets, the horns.

15
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.930
<v 0>[Inaudible] the articulation</v>

16
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.720
[inaudible].

17
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.310
<v 1>This is way, way,</v>

18
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:23.150
way beyond a high school orchestra could possibly play.

19
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.590
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.340
<v 1>The character of Mr. Holland. He's basically just beating time.</v>

21
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.050
It's a very robotic approach to conducting with both arms doing the

22
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:37.070
exact same thing.

23
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.490
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.840
<v 1>And this is one of the basic conducting</v>

25
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.160
issues that we try to discourage our students from doing.

26
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.540
We're not hearing press each other.

27
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.460
Inducting is all about separating your hands so that you can create

28
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.110
two different worlds. The right hand controls the pulse, the beat,

29
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.210
and has to be in a pattern a for pattern two, three, four,

30
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.020
a three, pattern one, two, three or two pattern.

31
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.950
And the left hand is all about emotion, about gesture,

32
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.880
about dynamics. This is getting louder. This is getting softer.

33
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.330
There's a lot that the musicians read from our faces,

34
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.750
but mostly it's working on this independence of hands,

35
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.110
which he doesn't exhibit whatsoever in this clip.

36
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

37
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.550
<v 1>I know that this is a sort of a very empowering and</v>

38
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.140
emotional scene,

39
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.800
But from watching his gestures,

40
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.690
we really wouldn't know that.

41
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.293
<v 0>Lingo.</v>

42
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.040
<v 1>On DAS gum.</v>

43
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.173
<v 0>Must be good.</v>

44
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.830
The lingo.

45
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.270
<v 1>Used here is a of two things.</v>

46
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:04.870
One is the text for the Requiem mass,

47
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.350
and this is from the Latin text for the mass.

48
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.000
And the section that they're working on is the confluent. The,

49
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.610
so that's actually the lyric that Mozart is composing it that way.

50
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.740
<v 2>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Go on VOCA may sort of vote. You</v>

51
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.280
write that down sort of a chase. Yes. Yes.

52
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.880
<v 1>When Mozart asks Sally airy to please write in SOTA vote, Jane,</v>

53
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.370
that's an Italian instruction that composers

54
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:41.970
use to describe the quality of the sound.

55
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.110
And so to vote chain means under voice.

56
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.570
So it's almost like whispering.

57
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.650
<v 2>And on Dictus yes. And underneath just violins arpeggios.</v>

58
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.720
<v 1>Or the other term arpeggio that's when the</v>

59
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.280
orchestration outlines the triads outlines,

60
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.320
the notes bought off.

61
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.823
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

62
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.330
<v 2>Sending stealing eighth notes and then back to the astronaut or again.</v>

63
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.500
<v 1>That's an arpeggio trumpets and D don't listen to me.</v>

64
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:20.340
I don't understand when Sally Arie says, I don't understand.

65
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.550
I don't think that's realistic. He would have definitely understood.

66
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.330
You don't understand.

67
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.160
The director is trying to point out how advanced Mozart was.

68
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.150
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Go on. I absolutely love this movie.

69
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:37.080
It's historically not 100% accurate. It's not to be believed,

70
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.270
but it so captures the immense talent

71
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.800
of Mozart. Thank you.

72
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.730
And the sense that he knew what he wanted to write,

73
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.630
and he could just put it right into the full score, just out of his head.

74
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.630
<v 0>Taking the patient music in his head, motivation,</v>

75
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.493
whiplash,

76
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.600
where you rushing or where you drunk.

77
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.740
<v 1>You know,</v>

78
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.240
I can barely discern that he's rushing ever so

79
00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:20.040
slightly, But you know, often musicians,

80
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.660
they need a little bit of runway to get into the groove of a piece,

81
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:26.040
especially young musicians.

82
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.600
The teacher has absolutely no tolerance for any kind of imperfection.

83
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.630
<v 0>Five, six, seven, four. Look at me. One, two, three, four, one,</v>

84
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.650
two, three, four.

85
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.850
<v 1>I think this kind of approach, you know, where you break,</v>

86
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.040
where a teacher breaks a student and then remold them and

87
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.590
rebuild them in, in kind of in their image.

88
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.390
It's a very self-centered narcissistic way

89
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.860
of teaching.

90
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.490
It can be effective because it's terrifying,

91
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.610
but I don't think people learn.

92
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.720
<v 3>Fear, start practicing harder. And Damon</v>

93
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.000
whiplash bar one 25.

94
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.020
<v 1>I think business is highly competitive.</v>

95
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.940
It's not unusual in a student setting to have competitions

96
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.320
for the first chair. So, you know, this can be either a,

97
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.210
an extremely productive and positive experience or it can be

98
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.100
like it is in whiplash. It can be a competition almost to the death.

99
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.270
<v 3>Why are you still sitting there? Get the out novice conductor,</v>

100
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.470
Mr. Bean.

101
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.800
<v 1>When I start the opening of Beethoven's fifth symphony,</v>

102
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.770
[inaudible] always have to be very careful not to make a gesture before that

103
00:06:56.771 --> 00:06:58.810
opening gesture, because somebody will play

104
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.560
And that's, what's so cute about this. It makes me laugh out loud.

105
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.820
He just moves the Baton and he gets a cord box.

106
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.270
First time conductor. I definitely give him high marks.

107
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.090
He understands the idea of body language and response,

108
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.090
and that's what comes across.

109
00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:35.530
So clearly in this little clip conducting a choir

110
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.640
sister act.

111
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.270
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

112
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.880
<v 1>First of all, I have to say, I love her enthusiasm.</v>

113
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.310
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

114
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:56.050
<v 1>You'll notice in this clip and it's quite realistic that Whoopi doesn't use any</v>

115
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.210
Baton. She uses just her hands.

116
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.190
This is quite typical of choir conductors.

117
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.140
It's more about dictating what's happening and really describing it

118
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:10.270
with your, with both hands,

119
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.100
as opposed to very elaborate patterns and trying to give

120
00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:16.210
cues to everyone.

121
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

122
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.330
<v 1>This is a much more visceral kind of approach to conducting.</v>

123
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.330
And I find that with choirs, it really works well.

124
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:34.660
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

125
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.090
<v 1>Absolutely adore what be Goldberg.</v>

126
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.820
I think she's phenomenal in this role,

127
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.720
this place there's so much heart in it.

128
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.340
And I think as a conductor, that's really what we're trying to do.

129
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.230
We're trying to inspire others to be the best they can be.

130
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.880
That's our goal

131
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.830
rehearsal unorthodox.

132
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.383
<v 0>Okay.</v>

133
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.000
<v 1>The thing that I love about this clip is that the orchestra is really playing</v>

134
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.090
the divorce string serenade.

135
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

136
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.020
<v 1>Level that they're playing at is a level that would be consistent with a student</v>

137
00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:27.980
orchestra. Gotcha.

138
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.850
Where are you today? It was pointing the wrong boy.

139
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.630
That's not exactly what a young violinists would say.

140
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.280
They would say I was on the wrong bow or I was doing the wrong bowings in

141
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:44.930
essence, what it means is that someone is out of sync. Where are you today?

142
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:49.520
When one player in a section is going in opposition,

143
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.410
it can really upset the look of the section and the ensemble

144
00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:55.070
too,

145
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.990
because string sections are accustomed to doing the same bowings at the

146
00:09:59.991 --> 00:10:00.830
same time.

147
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.673
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

148
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.870
<v 1>Is the main character trying to imagine herself in this</v>

149
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:12.704
setting.

150
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.450
What I loved about this series is that it didn't pretend

151
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.090
to suddenly make a virtuoso out of someone who couldn't

152
00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:33.890
possibly have achieved that level yet singers who are born with beautiful

153
00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:34.640
voices,

154
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.290
but no one comes out of Brooklyn after a few lessons on the piano already to

155
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:41.420
play the Philharmonic. Instead,

156
00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:46.340
it was much more realistic about whether she could

157
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.630
get into this conservatory. And if so, on what instrument?

158
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.580
Not that the piano, not fr I'm sorry, imitation copying Beethoven.

159
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

160
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.340
<v 1>We see the premiere of Beethoven's final symphony,</v>

161
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.130
his monumental ninth symphony.

162
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.700
And by this time in his life,

163
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.850
he was almost entirely dead.

164
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.500
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

165
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.480
<v 1>Following the conducting of the actress in front</v>

166
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:34.310
of him and really imitating her gestures because of course he can't

167
00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:37.070
hear the orchestra and can't react to it.

168
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.123
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

169
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.830
<v 1>It's not an easy thing to do,</v>

170
00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:46.040
to do the exact opposite of what you normally do.

171
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.020
I actually have played in an orchestra where someone who didn't

172
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:55.000
read music was taught to conduct in this way.

173
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.290
It was a very odd thing to experience,

174
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.730
but it was quite fascinating in a way to see this kind of

175
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.880
symbiotic conducting experience.

176
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.300
The premiere of Beethoven's ninth symphony could not have possibly

177
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:21.250
sounded this good. The piece was incredibly hard for the orchestra of that day.

178
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.230
They only had one day of rehearsal.

179
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.600
I want to say while I enjoy this clip so much,

180
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.650
I think that the playing is far too good. Most experienced.

181
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.300
These works of my conducting dancers, Mozart in the jungle.

182
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.230
We don't even know where this music is coming from,

183
00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.160
but this whole scene plays into this Maestro mythology. You know,

184
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:03.580
the idea of the conductor as this magician,

185
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.050
this inaccessible and talented creature.

186
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.850
It's very mysterious that somehow can conjure up music from thin air.

187
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.180
I mean, of course, I don't believe this for a second.

188
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.840
This is not really an instance of dancers

189
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.890
reacting to the conductor because they clearly have their own

190
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.740
choreography and their own movements.

191
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:42.010
I think this whole series Mozart in the jungle has been absolutely

192
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:46.180
wonderful for classical music in terms of bringing it into our homes and

193
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:50.740
demystifying it. But it also is a bit unrealistic

194
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.760
relationships meeting Venus.

195
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.490
<v 2>The orchestra work,</v>

196
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.450
according to schedule agreed within the union and the management.

197
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.980
So it was pointless to have a real soul yesterday and it will be equally

198
00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:07.290
pointless to talk about my ideas today.

199
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.610
<v 1>I think this is a fascinating clip because it really gives you some insight into</v>

200
00:14:11.611 --> 00:14:16.080
the hierarchy of, you know, who's, who's really in charge.

201
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.350
Please. When we see conductors with orchestras, they are clearly, you know,

202
00:14:22.351 --> 00:14:26.490
in the alpha role. But when we see conductors in the opera house,

203
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.870
the conductor has to contend, of course, with the musicians.

204
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.810
<v 2>You'll be here. I don't know. I haven't looked at much how you.</v>

205
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.370
<v 1>You have a diva like Glenn close.</v>

206
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.740
<v 2>Introduced to you, Maestro something.</v>

207
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.930
<v 1>You have to deal with that.</v>

208
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:47.130
The conductor is definitely on the bottom of this hierarchy,

209
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.233
hold Aria.

210
00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.160
That is not something that would normally happen.

211
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.090
The soloist speaks with the conductor and says, what's our plan,

212
00:15:04.091 --> 00:15:06.640
which will we do? And then the conductor would ask the orchestra,

213
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.110
please let's turn to this Aria.

214
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.310
I have great empathy for the character Santos.

215
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.500
So the conductor in this clip.

216
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.820
<v 0>Maya's through, we weren't even here yet.</v>

217
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.570
<v 1>There have been situations that I've been in where Oh,</v>

218
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.130
people don't show up or someone's ill and I've gone to an upper performance.

219
00:15:36.131 --> 00:15:40.240
And I have a different cast in the evening from what I had at the rehearsal,

220
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.320
you have to somehow manage all of these

221
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.820
catastrophes.

222
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.330
<v 0>Lucy, what I have to put up with souls at time. Can you shut them up?</v>

223
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.300
<v 1>Switching Gianna's school of rock.</v>

224
00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.403
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

225
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.490
<v 1>In this scene,</v>

226
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.290
Jack Black discovers that his students are really proficient

227
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.550
at classical music.

228
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.600
<v 0>You guys can really play. Why didn't anyone tell me.</v>

229
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.520
<v 1>Now he wants to introduce them to rock music and make a really</v>

230
00:16:15.521 --> 00:16:16.780
fantastic band.

231
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.550
<v 0>Two, three, four.</v>

232
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:27.700
<v 1>Cool musicians that go into rock. I think have a really fun time letting loose.</v>

233
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.460
I think when rock musicians come over to classical music,

234
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.930
sometimes they're shocked by the rigidity of this

235
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.300
style of music. Nothing could be harder.

236
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:45.250
What I absolutely love about this scene and about this whole movie is Jack

237
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.990
Black's enthusiasm.

238
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.710
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

239
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.860
<v 1>He's just dying to share his passion with us.</v>

240
00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.883
<v 0>Wow.</v>

241
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.020
<v 1>I think that is the number one criteria for being a</v>

242
00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:12.700
conductor is to want and really insist on sharing one's

243
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:13.960
passion for the music.

244
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.053
<v 0>Right?</v>

245
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.580
<v 1>It's really about capturing the groove for everything.</v>

246
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.350
That's ultimately the conductor's main job is capturing that group.

247
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:31.360
So I love it. Practice the orchestra rehearsal.

248
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:39.730
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

249
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.760
<v 1>It's clear that no one's playing an instrument.</v>

250
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.070
Their bows are going all which ways they're playing at different times.

251
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.110
[inaudible], He's conducting on the wrong beat of the bar.

252
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.570
So there's a sense of chaos.

253
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.490
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

254
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:05.180
<v 1>When the conductor is speaking while you're playing,</v>

255
00:18:05.181 --> 00:18:07.790
you can't hear what he's saying or she is.

256
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:15.440
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

257
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.390
<v 1>I've certainly never had musicians disrobe down to the skin in rehearsals.</v>

258
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.020
<v 4>[Inaudible] Namaste. [inaudible].</v>

259
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.990
<v 1>He's trying to catch someone out and really</v>

260
00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:40.040
reprimand them in front of the entire orchestra, which I think is,

261
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.890
is inappropriate under any circumstance.

262
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.130
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

263
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.850
<v 1>I think there's no turning back for this conductor. At this point,</v>

264
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:59.060
the point of this film is the individual characters,

265
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.800
and it's the idea of the individual revolting

266
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.060
against the establishment, which is represented by the conductor.

267
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:13.220
This isn't a highly political film and it's about much more

268
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.590
than an orchestra rehearsal,

269
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.900
Wrong note, Hannibal red dragon.

270
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

271
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:32.150
<v 1>Hannibal goes to the concert hall and listens to a performance of Mendelssohn's</v>

272
00:19:32.151 --> 00:19:33.350
Midsummer night's, dream.

273
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.010
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

274
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.250
<v 1>And he notices a few problems in the orchestra.</v>

275
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.860
People make mistakes. And I think it's important as the conductor to notice it,

276
00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:46.694
of course,

277
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.010
but how the conductor reacts can really impact

278
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.890
the, the entire piece from there. On.

279
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:57.380
<v 0>As soon.</v>

280
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.980
<v 1>As you start to kind of reprimand with your face,</v>

281
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.740
all the musicians start to go down this path.

282
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.340
It can be like a domino effect that everyone starts playing wrong.

283
00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:09.350
Those are everyone starts having errors.

284
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.190
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

285
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.490
<v 1>I think if I were a musician in the orchestra and I looked out and I saw</v>

286
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.920
Hannibal sitting in the audience,

287
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.520
I wouldn't have a bad day and play wrong notes to conclusion.

288
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:27.680
This was a wonderful experience to look at all of these clips and analyze them.

289
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.780
It made me realize what a metaphor music is and how much we

290
00:20:32.781 --> 00:20:35.330
connect with it on so many levels.
