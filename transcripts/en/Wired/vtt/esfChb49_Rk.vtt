00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>Hi, I'm [inaudible] and I'm doing the wired autocomplete interview.</v>

2
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.830
<v 1>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.680
<v 0>Is Dewey leaf. His real name. It's just early, but no middle name. That's it.</v>

4
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.700
It's Albanian.

5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.380
So that's why it probably sounds a bit weird to everyone.

6
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.080
What do a leap, a song are you,

7
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.520
I guess I I'd have to be all to them really. In some capacity.

8
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.400
What do a leap of fans are called?

9
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.810
There's no set name. I always just call them my loves.

10
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.980
They'd have to decide on their own. I can't, it's not my duty to,

11
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.580
to name them what was doing Deepa's first song.

12
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.660
The first song that I put out was called new love.

13
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.160
I put that out in 2015. Oh my God. When I look back on that video,

14
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:02.240
it's so crazy. What is daily? Pre-accident honestly,

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.080
I've no idea. British on most occasions.

16
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.330
Does Dua Lipa have a Grammy? I have to

17
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.050
feel so weird saying it does do Lipa speak Spanish. I don't,

18
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.710
but I wish I did. I feel like it's such a sexy language.

19
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.490
Maybe this should be my new year's resolution is learn Spanish.

20
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.220
Does do a leap of support Liverpool. Hmm.

21
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.760
How do I say this in the best way possible? I'm like, um,

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.230
can you say like honorary,

23
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:37.760
Liverpool supporter only because my dad and brother support arsenal,

24
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.860
and I think I'd be getting in a lot of trouble.

25
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.440
If I said that I just support Liverpool, but I love Liverpool.

26
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:47.090
It's always got a special place in my heart. It does do a leaper like anime.

27
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.540
I do. And my favorite anime is Ponyo.

28
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.130
It's the cutest I'm just obsessed with. It does do leave a play guitar.

29
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.330
I don't play guitar,

30
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.650
but I used to play the cello in school.

31
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.050
And then I got bullied about it a lot.

32
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.090
And so I quit and now I can't play anything.

33
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.390
How did do a leaper get discovered bit of a long

34
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:15.110
story, but I'll try and like shorten it a little bit. When I was young,

35
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.880
you know, I always wanted to make music.

36
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.510
I started making YouTube covers and I started showing them to my friends in

37
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:21.344
school.

38
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.830
And then I used them as like a form of portfolio to like work with different

39
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:27.320
producers and get in the studio. And I was like, you know,

40
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:30.350
I sing and I would love it. If we get in the studio and write together,

41
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.150
I made a bunch of demos and then I basically Googled managers in

42
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:37.910
London. And then I got offered like a publishing deal.

43
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.290
Then I had to find a lawyer.

44
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.170
And then the lawyer was trying to like help me and was like,

45
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:44.300
don't sign this publishing deal, whatever you do,

46
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.570
let me help you find a monitor. And he introduced me to my manager, Ben.

47
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.130
And so that was a really, really long story. Cut short.

48
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.930
How has Dua Lipa pronounced Dua Lipa? It's quite easy.

49
00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:58.580
Although growing up,

50
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.500
I feel it was really difficult for lots of teachers and people to pronounce it.

51
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.510
How tall is Dua, Lipa feet,

52
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.320
five foot eight and feet

53
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.480
size six UK.

54
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.560
How to get Dua Lipa hair. Yeah. On occasion.

55
00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:22.590
A lot of it is bought and glued in that's quite easy.

56
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:26.460
I felt like anyone could do that. But other than that,

57
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.000
I struggled to try and make it look nice. Bad hair days are kind of my thing.

58
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.210
What is homesick Lipa

59
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.710
about? It was really,

60
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:41.970
I'd spent so much time away from London and then it started pouring with rain in

61
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.600
Los Angeles. And it just made me miss London so much.

62
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.030
That's what homesick was about, was trying to get back home.

63
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.560
What do we leave per rules? Work hard and be nice.

64
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.630
What is duty? [inaudible] sign. I'm a Leo,

65
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.520
but I'm also a Libra rising and a cancer

66
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:06.540
moon. So I'm emotional as, but then really tough.

67
00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:09.540
So don't mess with me. What is duly PPAs, middle name?

68
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.460
I don't have a middle name. That's just do a leaper kind of wish I did.

69
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.900
What is electricity do a lipo about?

70
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.940
It's about love feeling so electric and completely sending these

71
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.140
electric messages all up and down your spine and the feeling that you get when

72
00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:29.820
you're falling in love. It's a fun song.

73
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.500
This was really a kind of turning point for me in terms of like confidence.

74
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:38.670
When I, when I shot the music video for electricity, it kind of changed my life.

75
00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:42.970
I was like for the first time I was in front of cameras. I was very much in,

76
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:45.960
in the zone and I didn't really care what anybody was thinking and I just kind

77
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:49.470
of let it all out. And that song will always kind of represent that for me.

78
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:52.380
And I made that with my friends, Mark Ronson and Diplo.

79
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.330
So it's always more special when you get to do stuff with your mates can

80
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.340
do it, Eva, sing a bloody hope. So otherwise I'm like, why I'm doing it.

81
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.170
Can do a leap, a drive. I can drive. I actually passed my driving test.

82
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.930
First time I would always get public transport,

83
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.710
but I do really love the freedom of just getting in your car and going wherever

84
00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:18.420
you want. Can duly per wrap only at karaoke.

85
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.250
That's where I like to rap. Cause I hate singing at karaoke. So I like to rap.

86
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.780
Can do it ever sing high notes. Um, I'm learning, I'm learning.

87
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:32.640
I definitely have such a low voice. So I've always struggled with high notes,

88
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:37.080
but I have been practicing and working with my vocal coach to be able to just

89
00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:41.610
like expand my range and learn some new stuff. Okay.

90
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.110
Who is dually for siblings? I have two sons, siblings.

91
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.970
I have a younger brother and a younger sister.

92
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.170
My sister is cooled Rina and my brother's called Jen.

93
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.550
And they are the loves of my life who is dually for the singer.

94
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.960
Interesting on, so I, um,

95
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.930
I guess do it put the singer,

96
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.040
I guess a songwriter first and foremost and born and raised in London,

97
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.490
but via Kosovo, which is where my parents are from.

98
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.980
And so I always feel like I'm from two places at once. And I,

99
00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:16.760
I also feel like that makes me who I am,

100
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.950
who is doing leap assigned to I'm signed to Warner brothers records first in the

101
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:26.420
UK and then in the U S and the rest of the world as well and

102
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.170
universal in Germany, who is doing the for stylist.

103
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.940
Oh my Amod at Lorenzo for SoCo. I love him.

104
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:38.240
I love collaborating with him. He's been with me for the longest time.

105
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:41.050
We've we've grown together and it's, it's been amazing.

106
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.540
Love him to pieces who is Dooley? His mum.

107
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.850
My mum is an angel sent from above. Her name is Anessa and she's my rock.

108
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.230
And my superhero, I wrote my first ever song when I was like four years old.

109
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:57.620
And it was about her. It was more like a joke of something at home.

110
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.570
It was an Albanian and it was all about when I grow up, can I wear your dress?

111
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.610
When I grow up, can I borrow your shoes? When I grow up,

112
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.210
can I be as pretty as you and still, my parents make fun of me sometimes.

113
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.090
And we still sing it to each other who is dearly,

114
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.310
has makeup artist today.

115
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.020
I have the wonderful Samantha who I love. She's amazing.

116
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.030
And she makes me feel like a million bucks was Dua Lipa in a

117
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:26.450
movie. No, I've never been in a movie. I don't know if I'm ready yet,

118
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.810
but I would love to do, at some point I enjoy acting. I just,

119
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.750
my main focus is always music was duly put on the voice.

120
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.040
No, I wasn't on the voice was do Lipa on X-Factor.

121
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.820
I wasn't on X-Factor but you know, earlier I said,

122
00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:45.700
I did like a commercial and then I got offered like a publishing deal.

123
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.860
I did the commercial for the X-Factor, where I sang for one of their adverts.

124
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.950
And then I ended up working with a producer for it,

125
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:57.100
who then offered me the publishing deal. And then I didn't end up signing that,

126
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.170
but it was like a series of events that happened,

127
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.530
which then led to me getting to do what I always dreaded and of doing was doing

128
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.990
leave at the Grammys. We have been to the Grammy's a couple of times,

129
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.610
it's a ways really, really exciting. I have some incredible memories.

130
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.440
The, alright, we go last one are,

131
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.820
do any fat and Bebe Rexha related B when not

132
00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:26.200
related, we are both Albanian. So I guess in that way,

133
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.340
I feel like all Albanian people call each other cousins or sisters or whatever.

134
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.680
Like you see an Albanian person on the street and you're like, yeah, yeah,

135
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:36.580
that's my cousin. But no, me and baby aren't related. I'm from Kosovo.

136
00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:40.120
And I believe Bebe's from Macedonia, but we speak Albanian and we're very,

137
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:44.440
very proud to be Albanian. I do really fan action Bronson related again,

138
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.820
not related,

139
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.440
but I do see him as my big brother also got the crazy

140
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:55.290
Albanian roots and he also gives me the best restaurant recommendations of

141
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:59.490
old time. Finally do Lipa and Taylor, Swift friends.

142
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.870
I love Taylor. We've met a couple of times. She's amazing. One.

143
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.670
What an incredible artist done. Thank you so much for watching.

144
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.330
Feel free to Google any questions and maybe I'll be backing onto yours.
