1
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.090
<v 1>Odd looking machine is called the tube.</v>

2
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.640
That is quite a paper airplane. It spins as it flies.

3
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.340
It gets us directional stability from how quickly that it's spinning.

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.630
But more importantly,

5
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.040
that's how it derives its lift from how fast it's spinning the

6
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:27.130
special boundary layer effect.

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.560
Little gobs of air gets stuck in all the tiny imperfections,

8
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:34.820
microscopic imperfections in the surface of this plane and the faster it spins,

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.660
the more it can interact with the surrounding air and develop lift.

10
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.540
The upshot is as it's spinning this way,

11
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:46.250
it can shove enough air off of that side to lift it up like that. So, uh,

12
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.900
because it's moving forward through the air like that.

13
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:51.530
So they're very interesting aircraft

14
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.770
round paper airplane. The center of gravity is right there.

15
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:56.780
It's not even in not even touching the plane.

16
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.280
It's in the middle of all that center of gravity in the middle thin air.

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.240
And so to fold it, we're going to start with an eight and a half by 11 sheet.

18
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.590
I'm going to start with the long side up. We're going to fold down one third.

19
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.760
And one third means that the layer part's going to be the same length as the

20
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.680
unlevered part. Uh,

21
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.370
and it's okay if the layer part is a little bit bigger.

22
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.460
And so to make sure that you're folding straight,

23
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.050
get this edge and this edge lined up and start in the middle and sweep to the

24
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:27.884
outside.

25
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.740
And there's one third folded over and you notice that's, you know,

26
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.610
visually you can see that's a little bit bigger than that, which is that's okay.

27
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.670
It's actually preferable to have that a little bit bigger. So don't,

28
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.900
don't sweat the one third thing.

29
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.750
You don't have to whip out the ruler and do any of that crazy stuff. Uh,

30
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.280
just get, get about a third over there.

31
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.200
Now we're going to fold the layer part in half, bringing a top down to that.

32
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.690
What used to be the top edge of the paper?

33
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.100
Make a nice sharp crease again, starting in the center and working our way out.

34
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.130
And one more time, we're going to fold the layer part in half right here,

35
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.200
just right through there. If you started with, uh,

36
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.880
anything thicker than 20 pound paper,

37
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.250
your fingers are going to get a real workout on this one.

38
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.900
So let's roll that over one more time. Folding the layer part in half,

39
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.670
take your time and line it up. Try to control those layers.

40
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.590
It's a lot of layer to control

41
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.510
and sweeping to the outside and making a sharp crease.

42
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:30.020
We're going to do something extraordinary here to sharpen this crease.

43
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.330
We're going to pick it up on this camera over here,

44
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.400
and we're going to roll it over the edge of the table to sharpen the crease.

45
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.830
And we're just going to work it back and forth.

46
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:43.070
The smooth side of the paper's up the layer, part.

47
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.173
<v 0>This down,</v>

48
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.700
nothing against the layer part rent over the corner of the table makes a great

49
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:50.534
satisfying sound.

50
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.520
<v 1>And now it's going to stand up.</v>

51
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.610
You can see it's going to stand up just like a little tunnel there.

52
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.900
You can reach right under it, standing up nicely.

53
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.330
Uh, now the trick here, let's flip it over so that we have the curb site up.

54
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.320
We're going to unfold just the last time we pulled it in half.

55
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.400
The last time we did that.

56
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.360
And I want you to come down here, um, to the right hand side of the plane.

57
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.950
And we're just going to lift up this corner here. Um, it's, it's layered.

58
00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:33.420
You can see there's a loop of paper here, a little loop of paper there. Uh,

59
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:36.930
and I want you to put a finger inside there like that.

60
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.560
So we're separating the two corners here, the two single layer corners,

61
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.630
and there's a double layer corner on top.

62
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:47.790
So we're just going to put a finger inside there like that,

63
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.140
and then grab the other end.

64
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.050
We're going to wrap the other end around and put it right inside there.

65
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.053
<v 0>Just like that.</v>

66
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.260
<v 1>And we're going to put it in there about that much. Yeah,</v>

67
00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:01.350
it's a little bit more than an inch, maybe an inch and a half, you know,

68
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.340
one thumb with almost a one and a half thumb with kind of an idea.

69
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.270
So again, I made that look really easy and I know it's not.

70
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.350
So I'm going to lift this top layer here.

71
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.140
Here's a single layer on either a,

72
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.680
you got a short single layer and a long single layer on one side,

73
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.070
and I'm going to put, just put my finger in there just to hold that open.

74
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.500
We've got a double layer there. That's got a corner.

75
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.860
That's a crease right there. So if you have two layers and two layers,

76
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.980
and we're just going to pick this other, end up,

77
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.810
roll it around and put it inside there, work fingers and slide it in,

78
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.900
you know, inch and a half or so, and then hang on to it.

79
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.710
Once you get it together,

80
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.800
hang onto it because what we're going to do to lock this plane together is

81
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:46.890
follow that crease all the way around that we unfolded.

82
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.660
So what I like to do is start here, hold on to it. Where the,

83
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.550
where the layers overlap,

84
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.670
where you put one inside the other and push it down right there.

85
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.030
I like to reach up inside here with a finger and just kind of hold that,

86
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:03.270
crimp that down like that. That'll help you as you're remaking the crease,

87
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.900
and this is going to get ugly. I'm warning you. Now. It's going to get ugly.

88
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.790
Here we go. It's getting ugly. It's getting really ugly.

89
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.170
It's getting very ugly. And then suddenly when you get all the way around there,

90
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:17.970
it starts to get beautiful. Look at that.

91
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.130
<v 0>It goes from.</v>

92
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.890
<v 1>Very ugly to very beautiful. And just, just a moment.</v>

93
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.800
<v 0>What's that. Now.</v>

94
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.720
<v 1>You can push in just so you can see I'm rounding it out just by going around</v>

95
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:31.554
there.

96
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.800
<v 0>Smoothing it out. And it becomes</v>

97
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.420
kind of an extraordinary circle here.

98
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.240
<v 1>Okay. Let's flip it over. This is the heavy side up with all the layers there.</v>

99
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.450
You can see all the layering right there. Let's turn it over. Just briefly here.

100
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.550
Right here is what we're going to fix next.

101
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.720
This is the tail of the plane it's popping up in there a little bit.

102
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.970
I don't like that. Some people leave that open.

103
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.900
You can leave that open if you want. It will affect the flight.

104
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.310
I feel like it adds a little bit of drag.

105
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:05.570
So what I'm going to do is just go around that edge about,

106
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.230
I don't know, two, three millimeters, you know,

107
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:11.180
something like a little bit less than a quarter of an inch,

108
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.580
and I'm just going to go all the way around the back of the plane.

109
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.130
Just moving that to the inside

110
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.500
and then just kind of pinching it, smooth that out.

111
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.400
And that really looks a lot better. Holds together a lot better.

112
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.220
It's going to be smoother through the air. There's your tube now.

113
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.190
There's no real adjusting here. This is it.

114
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.970
There's no control surfaces and you're going to throw it and it's going to

115
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.640
rotate like that. You're going to throw it, let it roll off your fingertips.

116
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.240
If you've ever thrown a spiral football, that's kind of what you're going for.

117
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.570
So, um, if you've never thrown a spiral football,

118
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.540
it's actually kind of easy to learn how to do it with this tube. Um,

119
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.260
start by throwing it like this and just giving it some backspin.

120
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.090
And don't worry about how far it's going.

121
00:06:56.091 --> 00:07:00.800
Just worry about developing a good amount of spin, just like that. And, and,

122
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.900
you know, throw it a few times so that you're kind of getting the hang of it,

123
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.500
imparting some good spin here. And once you got the hang of making it spin,

124
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.550
just turn your wrist like this same kind of motion down like that and let it go

125
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:11.270
that way.

126
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.990
And so that's a good way to learn how to throw this guy and you can give it a

127
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:19.220
fairly hard toss. It really likes a really good solid throw.

128
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:23.480
Give it to a lot of spin, really hard throw and wrap your finger around it.

129
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:26.810
Where the thick part is. Don't do it here with a S it'll squish on you,

130
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.580
but get up here where the thick part is,

131
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.920
wrap your finger around it and then really give it a good,

132
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:35.630
hard spin and a good hard fro it should zip out there. 60, 70 feet.

133
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.390
No problem. Uh, it's a great indoor plane.

134
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.610
It's a little bit crazy to throw out doors.

135
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:42.800
You can't really tell what it's doing. Sometimes it gets caught in the wind.

136
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.693
It does crazy things,

137
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.130
really fun plane to learn how to make extraordinary,

138
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:49.964
to learn how to.

139
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.580
<v 2>Why it's the tube.</v>
