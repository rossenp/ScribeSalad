1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>Okay. This question comes from scratch.</v>

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.730
Didn't get a chance to eat today and I'm starving all in caps.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.890
How does survivalists get by on like one bug a day?

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.000
We don't actually,

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.810
the reality of survival situation is you spend most of your time.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.710
Groveling for food.

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.190
Everybody thinks you're going to make a bow and arrow out of a piece of thread

8
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.590
and a Bobby pin. It ain't going to happen going hungry.

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.730
It's not that big of a deal without water. You're in big trouble without food.

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.670
You've got a couple of weeks before you're in real trouble.

11
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.360
So when I'm in a survival situation and I've got no food,

12
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.730
what ends up happening to me is I become really lethargic.

13
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.280
That's the downside of no food. You lose your energy,

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.960
but you don't die instantly. Hey, I'm less drought and this is survival.

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.050
<v 0>All right. First question comes from just Mickey and he,</v>

17
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.400
or she asks not sure if anyone watched platform on Netflix,

18
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:58.370
but wouldn't it be healthier to eat the maggots instead of the rotten meat?

19
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.090
Okay. So first of all, full disclosure, I have not seen platform on Netflix.

20
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.110
Actually. I haven't even heard of it,

21
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.780
but I have heard of maggots and I have heard of rotting meat,

22
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:06.890
and I have eaten both.

23
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.690
There is protein in both eating rotten meat is always the thing that

24
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:14.450
seems repugnant to everybody in a survival situation.

25
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.530
The reality is that you could eat rotting meat. In fact, many years ago,

26
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.040
most of our cultures all ate rotting meat of some sort.

27
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.880
We have it in many of our different recipes. If you will,

28
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.780
different things that we ate were often rotting, fish, rotting,

29
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.740
foul rotting, red meat. It goes on and on.

30
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.950
The maggots are full of protein and sweetness and sugars.

31
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.330
The real answer to this question, eat them both. All right, next question, Matt.

32
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.460
Borhees asks at real less drought and that's me serious survival question. Open.

33
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:49.010
Anyone went on a hike today and saw baby bear in a tree.

34
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.360
How close was the mom with question Mark exclamation point question Mark and

35
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:56.690
exclamation point. So this person is excited. We immediately left the area.

36
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.370
Okay. So an apex predator is like great, white sharks, polar bears,

37
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.590
African lions, Indian tigers,

38
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.160
but a secondary predator is the kind of predator that may eat you.

39
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:11.240
But it's likely going to be an accidental occasion. So black bears,

40
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.010
cougars, even grizzly bears in the case of a black bear. And for that matter,

41
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.270
in the case of a Cougar, get big, get scary. You can scare them away.

42
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.730
What does that mean? If you come upon a mother and her Cubs,

43
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.750
the majority of the times the mother will be taking off like a shot.

44
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.330
She'll go and she'll hide somewhere. And the Cubs will go up a tree.

45
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.560
How close is the mom?

46
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.230
Bottom line is you don't really want to take the chance because this is the one

47
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:37.070
time when a black bear is actually very dangerous.

48
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.900
A mother and her Cubs, any other time,

49
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:41.090
I would work really hard to scare a black bear away.

50
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.500
But when it's a mother and her Cubs, I'm not going to take any chances at all.

51
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.340
So how close was the mother bear to the Cubs? Does it really matter?

52
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.080
It's a mother bear and she's big and probably 340 pounds.

53
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.010
And you're not all right. This next question comes from Steve. Steve Sundell,

54
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.250
Sundell. I'm survivor, man. Right now survivor man. No, it's survivor man.

55
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.450
One word. Get it right. Steve. I'm watching survivor man right now.

56
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:11.680
And I still have a lingering question for survivalists. Why not?

57
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.590
Just always is, bring a bit lighter with you. You know what? Steve,

58
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.140
I've got the same freaking question.

59
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.640
If you're going to go out in the wilderness,

60
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.170
take a BIC lighter with you every single time. Why not? I agree.

61
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.240
Why not always do it? Okay.

62
00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:31.950
This next question comes with a photograph from frosty. Hey Les,

63
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.420
how do you like my first attempt at spoon making? It's beautiful frosty.

64
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.620
It's a thing of beauty. It's a work of art. And I'll just tell you this story.

65
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.910
When you take a survival class, the first thing you ever make is not a shelter.

66
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.350
It's not a deadfall or a trap or a snare. It's not a bow and arrow.

67
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.670
It's a carved out wooden spoon.

68
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.870
That's the first thing we always teach in survival class is how to carve up a

69
00:03:54.871 --> 00:03:59.670
spoon. Then we go on to trap some animals or gather some wild edibles.

70
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.260
And then the spoon comes in handy.

71
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.690
What we always want to do when we're teaching survival.

72
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.750
Those of us who are survival instructors is get people comfortable with their

73
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:09.690
hands, with building things, with cutting things, with nature,

74
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:12.150
but especially with using knives.

75
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:16.680
It's an incredible how often I'll see people in a survival class with no knife

76
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:20.640
using skills whatsoever. When you're trying to carve out larger objects.

77
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:23.250
When you're making dead falls and snares and traps and bows and arrows,

78
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.350
you're much more handy with a knife. All right,

79
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:28.440
next question comes from Aaron Buck at real estate.

80
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:32.730
How do you keep the camera batteries charged during your excursions?

81
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.260
I get that question a lot. In fact,

82
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:37.470
I get a lot of questions about my camera gear and field technique.

83
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.810
And I love those questions because as a filmmaker,

84
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.990
I enjoy sharing my creativity and how I came about it.

85
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.440
And one of the biggest issues in filming survivor, man, and indeed,

86
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.890
and filming my adventures before survivor man was keeping batteries charged.

87
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.740
I spent a year living in the woods and made a documentary called snowshoes and

88
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.100
salted.

89
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.880
And I literally took with me a car battery and a solar panel charged the car

90
00:04:56.881 --> 00:05:00.870
battery during the day and at night with the little adapter charged my camera

91
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:03.930
batteries. And that got me through a whole year, but it's way different.

92
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:08.640
Now I can put in a small pack on my hip enough battery

93
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:12.660
power to last me a week easily. The batteries got small,

94
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.160
they got long lasting.

95
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:17.280
So I just charge everything up at home and take a bunch in with me.

96
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:18.900
And it's actually not too heavy anymore.

97
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.940
Steve showing hammer as really hard not to comment on that Steve swing

98
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:26.430
hammer. How do you prepare for a trip?

99
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.790
Do you binge in the morning before to stay full as long as possible?

100
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:31.380
Or would that cause problems? Great question.

101
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.050
I don't get this question very often. So I want to answer it. Honestly.

102
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.690
I don't prepare at all.

103
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.780
And the reason why I don't prepare it all is because when I'm going out to film,

104
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.170
I want it to be as real as possible. I know I'm going out.

105
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.780
I know I'm making a film and I know I'm eventually going to go home.

106
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.530
So that nullifies some of the reality of being in a survival situation.

107
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.390
So if I were to also prepare by either gorging on food or slimming down and

108
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:58.160
trying to make my stomach smaller. So it doesn't hurt as when I'm in the woods,

109
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.761
either way.

110
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.420
Both of those ways in my mind are cheating because when you get lost in the

111
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:02.930
woods,

112
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.200
you don't prepare the night before thinking I'm going to be lost tomorrow.

113
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.890
And so I needed to have that reality there. So I didn't prepare it all.

114
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.500
I just go in as I go in, if I had a big breakfast that morning. Great.

115
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.190
If I didn't, I did two folks. One asked less,

116
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:19.220
how do you disinfect your hands in the wild after handling meat?

117
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.220
You're about to cook in this very disinfected society.

118
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.480
I struggle because I believe and agree with science,

119
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.900
that points out that we have a lot of bacteria that is healthy and that we need

120
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.970
now out in the wilderness.

121
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.360
There's even more of that healthy bacteria and even less of the nasty stuff

122
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.580
we're going to get in the grocery store from a shelf.

123
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.040
So I'm a big supporter of getting outside and getting dirty up your fingernails

124
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.930
and being part of the bacteria. That's in nature. So to answer your question,

125
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.890
twofold one, I don't disinfect my hands after handling meat.

126
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.780
I'm about to cook in the wilderness. In fact,

127
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:58.550
I eat a lot of the wild meat I might catch or come upon raw like

128
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:02.000
carpaccio or sushi. I don't disinfect my hands. I go with the flow.

129
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.810
I believe that it's actually made me stronger over the years. Chad Harmon asks,

130
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.410
how do you keep from inhaling a ton of smoke when starting fire?

131
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.090
It killed me the few times I tried and I'm a smoker. You kind of don't uh,

132
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.880
there is one trick when I'm doing the fireboat and I'm,

133
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:19.580
and I'm blowing into the embers and all that you breathe,

134
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.660
you just turned it aside. It's like,

135
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.130
or if I'm down and I'm trying to get a fire going on the ground,

136
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:25.630
getting started.

137
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.463
<v 2>Again. It's like,</v>

138
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.023
so.

139
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.580
<v 0>Absolutely I've gone and choked and sucked in so much smoke.</v>

140
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.410
And meanwhile, you're trying to get your fire going.

141
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:40.180
So not a good time to stall.

142
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.720
So there's not a really great answer to that question other than turn to the

143
00:07:43.721 --> 00:07:48.670
side and breathe, dude, Christa wants to know at real, less drought,

144
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:51.880
the following is suddenly driving me nuts.

145
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.350
How does man brush his teeth while out there for seven to 10 days?

146
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.390
Or does he, Oh, you're never going to want to kiss me because I don't, I mean,

147
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:04.690
I I'll use my finger. Sometimes you can take roots,

148
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.250
like spruce roots and things, and kind of do like a know cleaning of your teeth.

149
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.020
But mostly you're out in the Bush. You ain't cleaning your teeth and yeah,

150
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.170
it is kind of gross at trauma girl. Let's try it.

151
00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:22.090
If you truly only had one single pick at a survival tool, what would you pick?

152
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.660
No matter what the terrain easy answer. And I get this question a lot.

153
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.050
I would have a way to start a fire.

154
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.970
<v 2>Now. Oh no, no. You've got to have a knife.</v>

155
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.380
<v 0>No, you need to ask. No yet.</v>

156
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.500
Starting a fire is probably the most difficult thing in a survival situation.

157
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.420
I don't want to rub two sticks together.

158
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.160
Fire is just one of those things that serves so many purposes that I feel that

159
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:44.920
the best survival skill is knowing how to get a fire going.

160
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.890
So my number one tool, a method to start a fire,

161
00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:50.890
preferably a butane torch lighter style. All right,

162
00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:52.600
hopefully I'm pronouncing this correctly.

163
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.600
Eddie minion at real less drought thoughts on Altoid 10 survival

164
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:02.160
kits as set and forget items. What would you put in yours?

165
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.550
Interesting question. Don't get me going on survival kits.

166
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.340
Here's the first way I want to answer this question. And let's just say,

167
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.030
if you're going to have a survival kit, do not buy it off the shelf.

168
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.780
Don't do it. Turn away, walk out of the store, come back.

169
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.050
When you're ready to seek out your own items for your survival kit,

170
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.560
pick the things that are high quality, know that you know how to use them,

171
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.230
learn how to use them, put your own kit together.

172
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.190
That's the answer I will always give as far as which is the best survival kit to

173
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:33.630
have is the one that you make yourself with items you've sourced that you know

174
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:38.220
how to use, because anything else is just a case of trinkets. You open it up.

175
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.750
Most of it's probably going to be junk.

176
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:41.700
If it's bought off the shelf and half the time,

177
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:44.520
you won't even know how to use them. So that's my answer.

178
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.580
Build and keep your own survival kit. All right.

179
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.960
This looks like a serious question.

180
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:53.610
Mr. Ham tastic wants to know what would you say to someone who wants to take a

181
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:56.160
year or so and walk the great trail through Canada?

182
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.630
Any advice on planning or anything I could go on for the next hour on giving you

183
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:04.530
advice on this one, do it don't hesitate. Do it.

184
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.340
Don't think about making money over that period of time or the money you have to

185
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:12.600
make before you go in or what you're coming out to just do it too.

186
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:17.100
Many of us do not embark on an adventure because we're

187
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.720
obsessed with or concerned about our at-home lives. Our regular lives.

188
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:24.510
If you're going out alone or you've got a partner, I say do it.

189
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.870
I spent a year living in the woods and I remember getting a question one time,

190
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.800
how can anyone afford to spend a year living in the woods?

191
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.590
And the crowd went a little silent and I just took a breath.

192
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.570
And I just answered why you can't.

193
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.280
And I got a standing ovation with that answer because the truth is you can't

194
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.590
put these roadblocks in front of you before.

195
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.160
You're about to embark on a great adventure, just embark on it, prepare for it,

196
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.490
write things down, make a lot of lists. There's my pragmatic answer for you.

197
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.630
Write down a lot of lists, get it all focused in and go for it.

198
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.130
Mike Henley asks,

199
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.940
what would you say are the top five edible winter plants in the Temagami region?

200
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.930
For those of you who don't know where Tomago me is to Margaret is in my opinion,

201
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.740
the canoeing Mecca of the world.

202
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.780
There is no place where you can carry out long distance river

203
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:17.220
to Lake to river canoe trips. Like you can in Tomago Ontario, Canada.

204
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.010
It is stunning there. And not very many people go there. It's not a,

205
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:26.880
a major national park kind of situation. So you have stunning vistas,

206
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.240
amazing canoeing and not very many people there. It's fantastic.

207
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:33.840
So it's a great question to ask, but it also leads me down another road,

208
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.930
top five edible winter plants in the Temagami region.

209
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.700
This is a tricky answer because as I like to say in a survival situation,

210
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.270
if you're not on a tropical Island, it's pretty hard to be vegan.

211
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.530
It's pretty hard to be vegetarian. It's almost radically impossible.

212
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.950
So you need to be able to in a winter situation, into mommy, catch game,

213
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.320
like snowshoe Hare, which are easy to catch,

214
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.630
just the same to answer your question, Mikey,

215
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.930
certainly cat tail is always a good winter one because you can,

216
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.890
if you can get through the snow through the ice, down to the bottom,

217
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.120
through the freezing cold water,

218
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.770
the growth for next year is down there and they can be anything from an inch to

219
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:15.760
six inches long. And it's a beautiful edible. It's kind of like a cucumber.

220
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.230
Other than that, your reduced to a lot of wild teas,

221
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.310
spruce teas, pine tea, Willow tea, Birch tea, boy.

222
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.833
That's about it.

223
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.130
That's hard to gather wild edibles in the winter time in Northern Canada,

224
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.140
but go to, to marketing. You'll love it. Okay.

225
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:36.220
With the radically esoteric and creative web name of Graham,

226
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.570
he asks, I've got a long trip in the Scottish Highlands in winter.

227
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.220
What should I pack in my car for an emergency? Whoa, great question, Graham.

228
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.450
I can't say this enough that, you know, when I teach about having survival kits,

229
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:52.420
there's my personal survival kit. There's the group survival kit.

230
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:53.380
If I'm traveling with people,

231
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.310
I'm also teaching survival kits for in the home home survival kit,

232
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.290
but what's often overlooked and it's so easy is a car survival kit for

233
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:06.490
emergencies. So really the first thing you need for your car is, you know,

234
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:10.810
one of those sort of bins, plastic bins with a nice tight fitting lid size wise,

235
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.860
Oh, you know enough that could take 12 bottles of wine or 24 bottles of wine,

236
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.580
but that big,

237
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.510
and in that you pack everything you think you'll need some way to start a fire

238
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.360
way to cook and boil water insulation material,

239
00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:25.060
like a sleeping bag or something like that. It's your car.

240
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.380
You can set up an emergency kit for your car and just leave it and forget that

241
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:30.214
it's even there.

242
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.020
And that afternoon that you decide to take that shortcut because it's going to

243
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:37.240
be so cool. Oh, I wonder what that's going to be like over there.

244
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.980
And that's where you get the flat tire.

245
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.900
And you notice that your spares also flat.

246
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.480
You're going to thank me for having a car survival kit.

247
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.790
So what should you pack in it?

248
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.960
Use your own sort of powers of intuition and ingenuity.

249
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:54.700
What do you think you need if you were stuck with that car on a remote Hill,

250
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.940
in the Highlands of Scotland, Kathleen Stokes,

251
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.740
Phillips asks gonna ask you the silliest question. Well,

252
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.080
actually she's asking it on Capitol, so, gotcha.

253
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.780
<v 3>I'll ask you the silliest question.</v>

254
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.370
Where do you find toilet paper to go poo LOL,

255
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.540
depending on where you are.

256
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:17.190
<v 0>Usually the best toilet paper in the woods is MOS. Most of the Moscow vine,</v>

257
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.910
if not, all of it is not poisonous to the touch leaves are tricky.

258
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.970
You do not want to wipe your butt with poison Oak.

259
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.910
You do not want to wipe your butt with poison Ivy.

260
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.060
You do not want to wipe your butt with a cactus plant.

261
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.800
So find a MOS best toilet paper. In fact, my favorite kind of boss,

262
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.430
which sadly for the lower 48, you can't really get,

263
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.880
but up in the boreal forest, there's a mosque called Spagna Moss.

264
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.830
And for years it was actually used by indigenous cultures as their diapers,

265
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.980
as their toilet paper, it has antiseptic qualities to it.

266
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.700
It's my favorite paper. It's soft and it's good,

267
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.970
whether it's moist or dry and that's where I should stop there.

268
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:58.370
Or it's going to become too much information. Jolana Kia.

269
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:03.020
I like that name at Jolana Kia asks if perfect balance,

270
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.720
isn't part of your survivalist skillset.

271
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.480
How are you going to make it past your seventies?

272
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.530
Good point you might not do so well.

273
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.270
And that's why I still to this day and for the sake of a guy with a back that is

274
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:21.590
beaten up by, by carrying canoes, heavy packs and playing hockey.

275
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.850
I still do yoga every single day because balance is important.

276
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.020
Something that's overlooked in a survival situation is one of the key components

277
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:33.590
of whether or not you will survive. Something is actually your fitness level.

278
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.470
And so even for hardcore wilderness survival,

279
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.840
my yoga helps me a lot.

280
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.610
When I got a scale that Rocky area climb through that go through that swamp

281
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.960
balance is really important.

282
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.010
So how are you going to make it past your seventies without balance with

283
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:51.440
difficulty, everyone? Thank you so much for the questions.

284
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.740
Obviously some of them were silly and some of them were serious and I like

285
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.250
approaching survival that way anyway, because the thing is you got to laugh.

286
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.660
If you're in a survival situation,

287
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.770
remember there is only one thing you want to do go home.

288
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.760
You don't want to get to the other end of a survival situation and go, Oh,

289
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:11.960
I wish I'd made a better A-frame shelter, man. I wish I had tan to hide.

290
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.810
Now you want to go home in a survival situation.

291
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.590
So humor is important to keep your spirits alive.

292
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.260
I'm really grateful for these questions. They've been great.

293
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.350
I'm Les Stroud and this has been survival support.
