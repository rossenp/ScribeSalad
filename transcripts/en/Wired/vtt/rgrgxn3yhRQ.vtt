00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>Cheetahs can reach up to 70 miles an hour in just three sets.</v>

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.370
<v 1>If you were to look at the actual speed that a human being could run,</v>

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.740
you're probably looking at 30 kilometers an hour,

4
00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:11.630
but only for a very short period of time.

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.750
<v 2>Cheetos. What's the difference?</v>

6
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.813
[inaudible].

7
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.040
<v 0>The cheetah is able to run up to 70 miles an hour and everything about their</v>

8
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.780
physiology and their body is designed for them to reach very quick

9
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:01.670
speeds in a very short period of time.

10
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.930
I think one of the most unique aspects of the cheetah is the fact that about

11
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:12.350
50% of their entire body mass is made of mud.

12
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.390
<v 1>And the type of fibers that a cheetah has compared to the type of muscle fibers</v>

13
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:22.190
that we have are much more heavily weighted towards fast Twitch fibers.

14
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.900
And they are better able to contract at a much more quick

15
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:27.800
pace over.

16
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.420
<v 0>The percent of the musculature in the fi or the top of the back leg.</v>

17
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.960
And the cheetah is made up of these fast Twitch muscle fibers.

18
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.830
That's an enormously large proportion of that muscle type,

19
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.340
which is what enables them to reach amazingly fast speeds.

20
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.100
She does have a very large so muscle,

21
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.110
which is what helps extend out the hip and then pull it back

22
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.990
into the body very quickly and powerfully.

23
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.610
And that extension and flection is what enables them to push off very

24
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:02.150
strongly with their back legs and generate that power.

25
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.010
Take a look at this video of this cheetah running at high speed watch as the

26
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:08.270
cheetah is sprinting.

27
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.220
Those hind legs extend out and are pulled back very quickly

28
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:14.630
and very powerfully.

29
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.700
And you can see that spine flex when the cheetah is in full stride,

30
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.990
you can see that everything about it is built for being aerodynamic.

31
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.510
Even the ears are pulled back against the head,

32
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:29.690
cutting down on any wind friction. Another thing to note,

33
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.790
they actually have a four beaded gate,

34
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.620
very similar to a horse when it is galloping, but unlike other species,

35
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.330
the cheetah has two moments in its stride when all four feet are off the

36
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:42.830
ground at the same time,

37
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.490
If you think about the difference between a flat-footed walk and almost a tiptoe

38
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:53.324
walk,

39
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.070
the cheetah has some unique musculature whereby it can be

40
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:02.620
ready for action. To start that sprint almost on a, on the spur of the moment.

41
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.160
<v 1>When you're trying to run at speed,</v>

42
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.110
we are really only hitting or striking the ground with the ball of the

43
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:11.430
foot and the toes.

44
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.020
The reason why we are doing this is because we are trying to employ the foot as

45
00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:19.650
an additional lever with which to propel ourselves forward.

46
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.880
Take a look at this. We have a lever from the hip to the knee.

47
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.370
We have another lever from the knee to the ankle.

48
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.110
We have a third lever from the ankle to the ball of the foot.

49
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:34.470
And the last lever is from the ball of the foot to the toes.

50
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.330
This allows us to use the muscles of the foot and of the lower leg

51
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.250
from the calf downwards to generate power when the foot is contacting the

52
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:44.940
ground.

53
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.130
<v 0>So let's take a look at a cheetah foot.</v>

54
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.870
So not much of the bottom of the cheetah foot,

55
00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:55.560
the actual bones of the cheetah foot are in touch with the ground.

56
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.610
The nails are always extended acting like those track cleats.

57
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.750
When the animal sprints you can see there's only four toes here,

58
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.930
the middle two toes are the most weight bearing.

59
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:09.720
So they take the brunt of all of the cheetahs weight.

60
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.670
You may wonder what happened to the fifth toe.

61
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.370
That is actually what we know as the do cloth.

62
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.480
That is what they use to trip up their prey.

63
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.470
When they're chasing after it, as they reach the back legs of their prey,

64
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.990
they hook those back legs with that,

65
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.350
do claw causing the animal to trip and stumble,

66
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.230
and then they can jump in and finish the kill.

67
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.700
So you'll notice when the cheetah is sprinting after its prey,

68
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.720
it doesn't go in a straight line. The prey is trying to get away from the cat.

69
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.990
And so it makes a zigzag motion. When it's running,

70
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.880
it gets very close to the ground, almost touching its side to the ground.

71
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.850
And it's able to do that because those nails,

72
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:55.200
those claws on its feet are helping to give it a lot of traction and

73
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:56.034
stability.

74
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.840
She does breastbone. Isn't well attached to the rest of their musculature.

75
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.850
They call it a free floating breastfeed.

76
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.490
<v 1>They have a chest cavity,</v>

77
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.080
which allows a much larger expansion of space.

78
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:17.850
That's available to expand the lungs.

79
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.230
<v 0>And that actually enables them to have a lot of flexibility in the front.</v>

80
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.040
And to really stretch out that stride when they're sprinting.

81
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.701
<v 1>Humans,</v>

82
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:31.440
don't do that because we are tuned to be generalists and do lots of

83
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:32.940
things. Human respiration.

84
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.380
When you're exercising can go anywhere from 20 to 24,

85
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.540
probably even higher at maximum capacity.

86
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.100
<v 0>When a cheetah sprints,</v>

87
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.880
they have a respiration rate of around 150 breaths per minute.

88
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.720
<v 2>Does.</v>

89
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.060
<v 0>Disperse heat in several different ways.</v>

90
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.130
Their body temperature goes up so much when they're doing those very quick,

91
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:59.030
fast sprints.

92
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.350
<v 1>For human beings. We are fortunate to have a number of ways in which we can, uh,</v>

93
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.310
dissipate heat. The easiest to think about is through perspiration.

94
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.960
When we are generating heat,

95
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.030
we can start to sweat and the movement of air across the water

96
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:18.050
that's on the surface of the skin will allow us to cool ourselves down.

97
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.570
<v 0>Cheetahs can release heat through their mouth and even through their feet.</v>

98
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.700
<v 1>Another mechanism that we have for dissipating heat is through the hairs on the</v>

99
00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:30.880
surface of our skin. When we're trying to retain heat,

100
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.680
the hairs on our arms will stand up in order to slow the movement of air

101
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:39.520
across the surface of the skin. When we are trying to dissipate heat,

102
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.380
we will make sure that those hairs all lay flat so that we can lose as

103
00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:47.950
much heat to the moving air as possible.

104
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.570
<v 0>The black spots on the cheetah are thought to also help disperse heat.</v>

105
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.190
The hairs of the black spots are actually longer than the

106
00:06:57.191 --> 00:07:00.400
hairs that are the yellowish to orange color.

107
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.600
So those longer hairs are thought to help disperse and release the heat.

108
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.850
<v 1>The last mechanism that we can use to dissipate heat is through our</v>

109
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:11.230
respiration itself.

110
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.090
When our core temperature increases the air on the inside of us will also be

111
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:20.620
increased in temperature. And as we expire that warm air,

112
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.620
we will inspire cool air coming in,

113
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.500
which allows us to disperse heat through that mechanism.

114
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.320
<v 0>Cheetahs are of course, able to pant like you see dogs and cats do.</v>

115
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:36.820
Sometimes they have to decrease their body temperature

116
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.130
before they can consume it.

117
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.563
<v 2>Cal.</v>

118
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.360
<v 0>Cheetah has a very flexible spine,</v>

119
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.300
which enables it to move quickly,

120
00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:54.820
especially to Zig zag when it's chasing prey.

121
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.210
<v 1>When it comes to sprinting, flexibility is something that's quite important.</v>

122
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.470
Take a look at this video of a human sprinting. This is your stride length.

123
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.940
And our goal is to maximize that stride length when we're moving through

124
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:07.750
space,

125
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.280
the way that we do this is by increasing the flexibility of the hip

126
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.260
knee and the ankle joints in order to cover ground as quickly

127
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:18.094
as possible.

128
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.100
<v 0>The cheetah also has a very heavily muscled back,</v>

129
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.660
which helps that spine extend and flex so that they can

130
00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:29.380
stretch out when they're sprinting and really gain those longs.

131
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.273
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.480
<v 0>The cheetah tail is about 50% of the length of the</v>

133
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:42.130
entire rest of the structure.

134
00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:46.990
So it's very long in proportion to the entire animal and that tail

135
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.940
acts as a rudder.

136
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.890
So it helps it steer around sharp corners when there's zigzagging and

137
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:57.090
chasing after their, it's also a very muscular tail.

138
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:01.710
And so that helps as a counterbalance or a counterweight so that they don't lose

139
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:04.860
their balance as they're sprinting and turning quickly.

140
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.073
<v 2>Okay.</v>

141
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.860
<v 0>So let's take a look at a cheetah skull.</v>

142
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.470
So the cheetah's skull is very rounded and concave across the top,

143
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.670
and that helps it be very aerodynamic, just like the rest of its body.

144
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.500
<v 1>The human skull on the other hand is not designed for a specific purpose,</v>

145
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.910
but it is designed to allow us to be good at a number of different things.

146
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.320
There's a couple of things that are unique about the human scope.

147
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.370
One of the most obvious things is the size of the cranial vault,

148
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.760
which holds your brain and relative to other animals,

149
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.760
you'll find that the cranial vault for humans is quite large.

150
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:49.070
And this is because our brains are quite large.

151
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.900
<v 0>She just had really large eye sockets and they're true predators.</v>

152
00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:58.610
Those eyes are faced forward scanning all the time for potential

153
00:09:58.611 --> 00:09:59.444
prey.

154
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.640
<v 1>Because we are by Peele animals.</v>

155
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.170
We are able to see a much further distance because of our point of perspective.

156
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.390
<v 0>She does also have teeth designed for tearing muscle meat</v>

157
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:16.250
very quickly and ingesting as much as possible in a very short period of

158
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:19.670
time. They're called bolters. They actually bolt their meat.

159
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.880
They can eat up to 10 to 15 pounds of food at a time,

160
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.590
and to be able to consume up to 15% of their body mass and

161
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:31.790
food is an amazing and amount of food that they can eat all at one time.

162
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.760
<v 1>In order for humans to run as fast as a cheetah,</v>

163
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.500
this is how they would have to change.

164
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.780
I would want to make sure that the muscles on both the front and the back of the

165
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.810
thigh were as large as possible.

166
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.190
I would want to shorten the length from the hip to the knee,

167
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.150
but I would probably lengthen the lever from the knee down.

168
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.470
I would make the foot so that the heel of the foot was suspended in the air.

169
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.510
We could end up having clause to propel ourselves much more efficiently.

170
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.340
Every time that we contact the ground.

171
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.470
I would also want to make sure that the muscles of the shoulders and upper

172
00:11:15.471 --> 00:11:19.610
chest were quite large with the floating breast bone in the front in order to

173
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:20.780
increase the turnover.

174
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.650
Those are some of the things that I would do to create the ideal sprinting,

175
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:25.484
human.

176
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.870
