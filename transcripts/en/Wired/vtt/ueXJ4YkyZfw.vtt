00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>Ken Chelsea handler saying, Oh no.</v>

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.100
Hi, I'm Chelsea handler.

3
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:12.360
And today I'm doing the wired autocomplete interview.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.500
Okay. Let's start. Where did Chelsea handler grow up? That's easy New Jersey.

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.830
Where does Chelsea handler live? Don't worry about it.

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.530
Where did Chelsea handler go to college? Chelsea handler took her SATs on acid,

7
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:32.210
so she never got accepted to college, but she had a great time taking that test.

8
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.170
Where is Chelsea handler's house in Spain? Oh,

9
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.790
well my Orca, where is Chelsea handler?

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.050
2019. I don't know. Maybe I disappeared for that year.

11
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.060
Where does Chelsea handler get her shirts from my stylist?

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.770
I think you're talking about the rock and roll shirts.

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.260
I don't know where I got to either. Sorry, I can't be of more help.

14
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.480
Who is Chelsea handler dating? I'm single right now and available.

15
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:03.380
And after seven months of being stuck during COVID,

16
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.050
I'm willing to date almost anybody.

17
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.080
So I want to open,

18
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.550
I want to cast my net a little bit wider than I've been casting it in previous

19
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:18.530
years since I need to lock something down soon because I'm

20
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.410
in decline. I mean, I have orthotics now.

21
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:24.230
I just got my first pair of reading glasses at CVS.

22
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.100
I shaved my face the other day and also put on aftershave.

23
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:31.940
So I think that I need to lock something down quickly in terms of a man.

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.720
So if you're watching this and you think, yes, please contact me.

25
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.520
I had a big crush on Andrew Cuomo when the pandemic was at its height in New

26
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.480
York city, because I liked what he was bringing to the table. But in reality,

27
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:48.200
that's a little bit, I like somebody who can come in, you know, like he's like,

28
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.300
like, and just handle a situation. I want somebody to kind of manhandle me,

29
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:55.250
which isn't a popular thing to say right now,

30
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:58.610
but I like that kind of old fashion, like old men get me.

31
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.550
My sweet spot is between 60 and 80 year old men.

32
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.240
Unfortunately I'm not willing to date men that age. My ideal guy,

33
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:09.560
if I had to pick a celebrity, I would pick like a John ham type,

34
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.690
but I'm not really trying to date a celebrity.

35
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:15.830
I would like a real person who is Chelsea handler's therapist. Funny.

36
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:20.270
You should mention that my therapist's name is Dan Siegel and um,

37
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.490
he really helped me kind of like uncover my own self-awareness

38
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:30.350
and also he helped me discover, you know,

39
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.150
all of my shortcomings, my lack of patient, my constant irritation with people,

40
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.750
um,

41
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.250
constantly finding people annoying and wondering why and not understanding that

42
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:43.400
everybody didn't find everybody else annoying. Um,

43
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.440
he is somebody that really helped me with all of those things. So,

44
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.650
uh, I owe a lot to him. I wrote a book about him. He's in my book.

45
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.730
Life will be the death of me.

46
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:56.060
And I talk about him in my standup special because he really did help me unlock

47
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:57.980
a lot of my childhood stuff.

48
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.100
And he he's like kind of famous in his own right in therapy circles anyway.

49
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:06.700
So, um, a lot of people do know him. And then after I went to him,

50
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.340
like five of my celebrity friends also told me they went to him.

51
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:13.390
So I'm not so special after all who does Chelsea handler look like

52
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.340
Martha Stuart apparently, Oh, somebody tells me Claudia Schiffer. I liked that.

53
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:20.680
I'm going to do a side-by-side on Instagram with her soon,

54
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.110
but I have to get the right angle because it's obviously not,

55
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.460
we're not identical. Who else do I look like? Jenny McCarthy, Elizabeth Banks.

56
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.940
People always get us confused. Yeah. I think that those are,

57
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:34.270
those are my four main ones. I don't get confused with Martha Stuart,

58
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.070
but I did do a side-by-side of Martha store to me on Instagram and she kind of

59
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.590
looked better and younger. So I'm still confused about that.

60
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.820
Let's go to the next one.

61
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.170
What is Chelsea handler doing now?

62
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.640
<v 1>This interview.</v>

63
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.240
<v 0>What is with Chelsea handler and oranges?</v>

64
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.410
My psychiatrist handed me an orange in one of our sessions and I wrote about it

65
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:00.340
in my book and it's in my new stand-up special. When he handed me this orange,

66
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.550
it was a turning point in our therapy experience.

67
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:06.610
So I look at orange as kind of like a life raft.

68
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.210
When you see somebody who's going through a troubling time or going through

69
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:11.110
something difficult,

70
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.280
handing them an orange is like a metaphor for handing them a lifeline.

71
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.910
So that's why I like oranges. And I like orange juice also.

72
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.030
What is Chelsea handler like in real life? A.

73
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.260
What does Chelsea handler look like? Sometimes. Good.

74
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:30.970
And sometimes not so great. What is Chelsea handler's real name?

75
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.770
Chelsea handler. What does Chelsea handler eat? Not that much.

76
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.670
It turns out I'm eating less and less. As I transitioned into an elderly woman,

77
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.660
I have to be honest. I really like liquid more than I like food.

78
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.130
So I love green juices and I love like sparkling

79
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:49.030
waters.

80
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:53.740
And I think I'm filling up on so much fluid that I have

81
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:57.640
lost my interest in food. So my food is really plain.

82
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:00.310
I eat like plain Turkey. I do love chicken nuggets.

83
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.100
I've always loved chicken nuggets and that's never going to stop.

84
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.860
So that will always be, um, you know,

85
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.100
one of my shortcomings as a 45 year old adult woman.

86
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.090
Anyway. Oh, another thing I like to eat is egg whites.

87
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.670
And this is something a recipe that I've, well,

88
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.280
I can only really make it for myself because no one will eat my food,

89
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:22.840
but I like egg whites in the morning with I scrambled egg whites with

90
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.160
avocado slices.

91
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:29.050
And then I take that old fashioned kind of Romano Parmesan cheese,

92
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.140
and just douse everything and Parmesan cheese.

93
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.270
So basically I'm eating like a cheese and avocado dish with a little

94
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.560
bit of egg whites on the side.

95
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.330
It's mostly cheese is Evan handler

96
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.300
related to Chelsea handler. Great question.

97
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:50.800
I asked him the same exact thing and he's not related to me or so he

98
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:55.450
says, he's an actor by the way, is Chelsea handler vegan? No,

99
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.750
I think vegan people fart a lot and I have been around them and I've smelled

100
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:02.210
their farts and I'm not interested in being vegan because of that.

101
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:06.560
Although I am down with being a vegetarian and not, and not eating animals,

102
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.510
I'm ready to go in that direction.

103
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:10.400
And I think we're all kind of heading in that direction,

104
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:15.110
whether we want to be or not. Is Chelsea handler a pharmacist?

105
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.460
Funny? You should mention that. I am very passionate about pharmacology.

106
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.050
A lot of my friends depend on me for pharmacological advice and intuitiveness.

107
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.140
I would frame myself as a pharmacological into it,

108
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.080
not to be confused with the pharmacological Inuits,

109
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.330
which would be an Alaskan pharmacist.

110
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.380
<v 2>I like I can look at your body.</v>

111
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.980
<v 0>And talk to you for three or four minutes and basically tell if you're going to</v>

112
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:43.660
be good on Vicodin or if you would prefer Xanax or maybe you'd like an ambient.

113
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.770
I know what drugs are gonna work for. What people I've helped.

114
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.540
My sister I've helped so many people in my family,

115
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.440
my personal favorite pharmaceutical. And by the way, I'm not a doctor.

116
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:56.080
So don't take it and then blame me for anything.

117
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.250
But doxy cycling will knock anything out of your system.

118
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.110
It can knock malaria out of your system. It can get rid of acne on your face.

119
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.040
I mean, doxy cycling twice a day, a cycle of it for 10 days,

120
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.600
we'll get rid of almost anything.

121
00:07:10.601 --> 00:07:13.630
And I take one every morning just because I don't want to walk around.

122
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.230
Is Chelsea handler related to Goldie Hawn? Sort of,

123
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.260
I call her mama G and I,

124
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.020
and she says that I'm her daughter. I mean,

125
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:27.610
I think she says that to a lot of people,

126
00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:31.300
but I'm going to pretend that she only says it to me and I am close with their

127
00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:34.120
family, their families. Like I like to go over there and,

128
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.970
and be around that whole family. I like their,

129
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.780
I like the drama and I like all the different kids from the different

130
00:07:40.781 --> 00:07:44.020
relationships. It's like a little patchwork puzzle. So yeah.

131
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.910
I like to spend family time with Goldie.

132
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.130
<v 2>And Curt. How.</v>

133
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.720
<v 0>Old is Chelsea handler? Funny. You should mention that I'm 45 years old.</v>

134
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.370
So I'm in my middle life. Does that sound sexy date?

135
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.170
How to contact Chelsea handler? Uh, I probably Instagram.

136
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:04.960
I usually try and message people back on Instagram.

137
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.390
When I have an inordinate amount of time,

138
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:09.520
I can sit there for hours and write messages,

139
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.790
but that's or Twitter I'm on both pretty frequently.

140
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.690
How did Chelsea handler meet chewy? Well, that's a cute story.

141
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.810
So when I had the show Chelsea lately, they wanted me to have a sidekick.

142
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.980
And so they brought in like, you know, a bunch of these kinds of characters.

143
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.670
And when I saw chewy, I was like, you're going to be with me.

144
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.050
And we hired him. It was one of the most fruitful relationships of my career.

145
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:35.230
I mean, it was like being in a good mood every time you walked into work,

146
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.680
because every time you see his little face come around the corner with his cute

147
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:42.340
little outfits and his Barets and you'd go into his dressing room and they had

148
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:46.120
all his little shoes lined up and he was just the sweetest little guy and he was

149
00:08:46.121 --> 00:08:48.670
close with his family and he was close with my family.

150
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.440
So I met him on an audition.

151
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:53.290
We were auditioning for sidekicks and I saw him and I was like,

152
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:56.700
forget everybody else. That's the, so yeah.

153
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.650
Was Chelsea handler in hunger games? That was Elizabeth Banks.

154
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:08.160
Ken Chelsea handler sing. Oh no,

155
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:12.180
I can't sing. And I can't dance. I blame it on being Jewish,

156
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.170
but I don't know if that's the real reason the dancing is the Jewish problem.

157
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.850
I don't know what the singing problem is,

158
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.360
but nobody in my family can sing or dance. And that's why I talk so much.

159
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.740
And so often, which Chelsea handler book is the best.

160
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.960
Uh, I would say life will be the death of me with the, my last book.

161
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:34.770
That was the most personal, that was the most real, that was like post therapy.

162
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:37.860
So it's really raw. Uh, yeah,

163
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.580
and that's what I based my new stand-up special off of my last book,

164
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.180
Chelsea handler Zodiac. I am a Pisces.

165
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.870
And if you're into any programs, I'm a number eight, which is another thing.

166
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:53.160
My psychiatrist, Dan Siegel taught me, uh, about any of grams,

167
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.220
which is a kind of way to like frame your personality.

168
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.640
There are nine numbers and you kind of figure out which number you are.

169
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.190
And so it's a really cool way of like, uh,

170
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.850
learning more about your personality type without astrology.

171
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.880
I went through my astrology phase and I'm kind of over it. You know,

172
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:12.350
it's just seems a little bit silly. Thank you so much wired.

173
00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:15.080
I hope you learned something about me that you wanted to,

174
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.490
and I want to wish everybody happiness and to find joy in this kind of confusing

175
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:24.440
time and not to give up hope, to be optimistic and to be hopeful and,

176
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.850
uh, yeah, just try and stay strong. You know, we're all in this together.
