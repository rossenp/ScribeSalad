1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>Do the books or letters have any hints at what weapon did.</v>

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.920
<v 1>We're on use at the final battle of the war of the last Alliance.</v>

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.260
<v 0>One weapon that sound is described as using, and it's his hands.</v>

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.180
He is said to have killed Gilgo ad with his burning hand.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.550
So sour on his hands were like fire.

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.230
So the only actual weapon that siren is described in the book as using is his

7
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:28.640
own hands. And I ha I think you have to admit that's, that's pretty metal.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.600
This is Corey Olson, the talking professor, and this is talking support.

9
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.000
<v 1>Okay. Gail Simone asks,</v>

10
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.620
does anyone know if the syllabics near reversal of the names fatten and Dennis

11
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.850
Thor was intentional?

12
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.980
<v 0>Yeah. So first of all, Gail, I would say,</v>

13
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.610
I certainly agree with you about the way that those two characters parallel each

14
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:52.040
other. That seems a really important thing.

15
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.630
And Dennis Thor who's despair leads him to madness. Ultimately,

16
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:57.200
in the end,

17
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.550
I would say that the relationship between their names is semi accidental Tolkien

18
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:06.230
as always derived the names of his characters from the languages

19
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.760
that he was dealing with. Dennis Thor comes from his own,

20
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.410
made up languages, Fayette, and does not. They,

21
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.270
it didn't comes from Anglo-Saxon. Uh, the language of the row here, um,

22
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:22.040
is essentially Anglo-Saxon and Faden in Anglo-Saxon basically

23
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.730
means King as the, uh, talking scholar, Mike drought.

24
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.460
Who's also an Anglo-Saxon scholar has pointed out.

25
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.230
If you go through the names of all of the Kings in the history of Rowan,

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.210
almost all of them have names. That mean King is like King son of King,

27
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:39.560
son of King, son of King,

28
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.360
almost the entire genealogy of the Kings of Roohan all basically mean King and

29
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.780
Denis. Thor is from the Elvis languages. However, uh, you know,

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.920
Gail having said that,

31
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.080
is it a coincidence that their names do kind of resonate in that way?

32
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.490
No, I don't think it is a talking had a really good ear. Uh,

33
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.010
he was very sensitive to the sound of words,

34
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.360
the way in which their two names involve a lot of the same sound properties kind

35
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:08.420
of shuffled around in different ways is I think something that probably would

36
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.660
have appealed to him as he was certainly aware of the way that their two

37
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:13.820
characters were developing. Mark.

38
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.660
<v 1>That is a person named Mars. Presumably not the planet.</v>

39
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.820
As I rewatched the Lord of the rings movie,

40
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:24.320
I still wonder what is sovereign human or bad hell for some other creature?

41
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.380
Great question. So saffron is a must.

42
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.980
<v 0>Yeah. An angelic being, he is not a mortal creature,</v>

43
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:34.460
either elf or human. There were in talking's world.

44
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.380
A lot of these sort of,

45
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.120
kind of semi divine creatures kind of like angels Celeron was one of these.

46
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.120
Some of them, of course, many of them were good. That's ultimately,

47
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:47.630
that's what Gandalf is also one of these same creatures.

48
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.720
He is a spiritual being taking physical form.

49
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:54.080
That's why when he dies, because he's actually slain,

50
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:58.490
his body is killed in the battle and his spirit fleas, but his spirit is great.

51
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.690
We weakened this, but it's not gone.

52
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.600
So he is eventually able by the time of the Lord of the rings, he can manifest,

53
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.570
uh, in a physical body again.

54
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.100
<v 1>All right. Morgan, number five asks when Gandalf went from gray to white,</v>

55
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.940
was it just a one-off or was it a company-wide promotion did routing as the

56
00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:15.980
Brown become Radigan.

57
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.940
<v 0>The gray, it would have been tough for Ella and.</v>

58
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.070
<v 1>Polando going from blue to Brown.</v>

59
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.000
<v 0>Okay, good. Excellent question. It is a very natural thing.</v>

60
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.740
When we read about the color of the wizards to imagine that the wizards color is

61
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:32.250
a sign of rank and that there is a hierarchy,

62
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.740
a strict hierarchy among the colors.

63
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.430
Here's how I understand the colors of the wizards.

64
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.330
The colors of the wizards are a sign of their,

65
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.040
not of their ranks, but of their roles of their particular jobs.

66
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.180
Solomon had a job. He was the white and as the white wizard,

67
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:56.040
he had a job and his job was to be the enemy of Celeron and

68
00:03:56.041 --> 00:04:00.990
to lead the forces of good against sour on Solomon gets canned

69
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.410
from his job and Gandalf takes over his job.

70
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.780
This is why when Gandalf returns, he's the white,

71
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:09.720
not just because he's more powerful. He is more powerful,

72
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.100
but because he has a new role and he is now the white wizard.

73
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.620
And when he comes back, you'll notice he acts like it.

74
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.540
He is in the forefront leading the good guys overtly

75
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.260
as the enemy of sour on that is Solomon as he should have been.

76
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.170
That is what the white wizards job description is.

77
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.810
Now this leads to a very sensible question.

78
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.860
What is the job description of the grey wizard? What was Gandalf's job before?

79
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.840
It seems that his job as the gray is to go around and encourage and support

80
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:44.730
people just as a rat aghast, the Brown, his remit is clearly birds and beasts,

81
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:46.620
right? He is the friend of birds and beasts.

82
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.320
Gandalf's remit is not birds and bees, but people.

83
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.430
And the way that we see him going to the kind of relationships that we see him

84
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:57.030
establishing in, Gunder in love, Lorian in the Shire,

85
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.800
suggests that going around and encouraging and supporting these different

86
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.000
populations of people.

87
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.410
That seems to be as far as we can tell what the job description of the grey

88
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:11.610
wizard is. So, no, I do not think that, uh,

89
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.010
all of the wizards get a company-wide promotion.

90
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.020
The shift from gray to white is a change in job description for Gandalf,

91
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.190
not a rank.

92
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.800
<v 1>Promotion. So Ryan asks.</v>

93
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.780
<v 0>Do they have campuses in middle earth?</v>

94
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.590
Does Arctic get magnetic poles after the [inaudible]

95
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.590
? Yes, it has poles. Do they have campuses? I don't think so. We have no references to anybody 

96
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.590
use encompasses and finding magnetic North does magnetic North exist

97
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.590
. Yes, it certainly does the reference to does to

98
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.590
 get magnetic poles after the Akala Beth, that Ryan asks, of course, the 

99
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.423
[inaudible]

100
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.360
is the story of the downfall of Newman or the old version of talking's

101
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:52.051
mythology.

102
00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:56.790
The elder days in talking's world are a flat earth mythology.

103
00:05:56.791 --> 00:06:01.340
They take place on a flat earth when the Island of Newman arm is

104
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.080
sunk beneath the sea. At the end of the second age, the world is made round.

105
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.060
So it's not just that the Island drops,

106
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.460
but the world is made round at that point.

107
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.570
So does RD get magnetic poles at the point when it's made round? Yes.

108
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.360
It certainly has them. Does anyone navigate by them?

109
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.890
That is not at all clear. So again, there's no explicit references to campuses,

110
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.100
but a compass would certainly work in middle earth. That seems fairly clear.

111
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.720
<v 1>A question from Zachariah S pumpkin's.</v>

112
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.010
If the black speech of mortar is so ugly to listen to how come it looks so

113
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:36.190
pretty when inscribed upon the one ring it's written in Tang war,

114
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.680
but did the black speech have no written components,

115
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.350
was sour on flexing his calligraphy or was it.

116
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.270
<v 0>Elvis has only choice? Um, really interesting question that script of course,</v>

117
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:50.050
was designed by. It was invented by talking. He invented several,

118
00:06:50.051 --> 00:06:54.850
not only languages, but also scripts sour on devised the black speech,

119
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.930
because he had an ORIC problem. He had communication issues in his armies,

120
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.860
the Orks couldn't communicate with each other. So he invents the black speech.

121
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.431
In some ways,

122
00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:07.240
it actually was kind of a failure as a linguistic experiment by siren.

123
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.190
This script that fits his language does not fit the work that he wants to

124
00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:15.370
do. So the fact that he asked to borrow from the elves,

125
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:19.690
borrow their script in order to make his inscription on the ring is a little bit

126
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:24.400
of an indictment against Saudi Iran and kind of shows in the end.

127
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.910
He can't really create new, wonderful things himself.

128
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.700
He's not capable of creating beauty.

129
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.760
He is in the business of tearing beauty down.

130
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.500
<v 1>All right. John Carney asks the classic and excellent question.</v>

131
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.450
What happened to the ENT wives?

132
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.340
<v 0>The answer we don't know.</v>

133
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.230
<v 1>Tolkien was asked this many times.</v>

134
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:47.370
He answered this question a couple of times in his letter and his answer.

135
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.600
<v 0>There was, I don't know though.</v>

136
00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:53.950
He does say on one or two occasions that he suspects that they're dead.

137
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.960
The N wives lived in the lands down near

138
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:03.130
the end when North of the [inaudible] place, that's called the Brown lands.

139
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.030
They're quite close to Mordor. I'm not exactly on the doorstep, but you know,

140
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:11.350
they're like a suburb of Mordor where they all slain by sour on where they

141
00:08:11.351 --> 00:08:14.710
scattered and do they still exist somewhere? Talking said,

142
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.510
he didn't know for sure. It's a mystery.

143
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:19.750
There are several things that he deliberately left mysteries that he said he

144
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:21.280
himself didn't know the answer to.

145
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.040
So nobody can give a definitive answer to that question.

146
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.120
<v 1>All right. Another question from Signore P for non hobbits,</v>

147
00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:31.570
can you name one other town or village in the Shire that isn't,

148
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:33.640
Hobbiton sure there are lots of towns.

149
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.380
<v 0>And the Shire nickel Delvin is the name of the capital of the Shire,</v>

150
00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:41.380
essentially. It's the center of the Shire. Uh, the two other.

151
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.900
<v 1>Most important places in the Shire are.</v>

152
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.560
<v 0>Buckland, which is the home of the Brandy bucks and tuck borough,</v>

153
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.200
which is the home of the Tooke family.

154
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.410
And there are a number of other towns that they pass through Bywater, of course,

155
00:08:53.411 --> 00:08:57.350
which is right next to Hobbiton. There's what all in stock, uh,

156
00:08:57.351 --> 00:09:01.230
and several other towns along the way that we hear about during the journey of

157
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:02.970
the hobbits, they're in the fellowship of the ring.

158
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.480
<v 1>Jeff airmen asks,</v>

159
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.870
I always find it funny that the plural of elf is elves,

160
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.880
but the plural for Dorf is dwarfs, not dwarves talking popularize.

161
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.870
This, I read that it has to do with the origin of the word dwell org,

162
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.100
old English or dwarf.

163
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.390
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

164
00:09:20.391 --> 00:09:25.070
So this is something that talking as a philologist that is somebody who

165
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.600
studied language quietly rebelled against it is true that the traditional

166
00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:34.460
plural of dwarf the technically correct plural is dwarfs

167
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.660
and talking hated that because linguistically it is not sound.

168
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.210
It just does not work. It doesn't make sense. Uh,

169
00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:45.350
so he innovated his pluralization dwarves,

170
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:50.240
which he insisted on in the Hobbit is his kind of rebellion

171
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.530
against what really is not a very sensible pluralization at all.

172
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.550
And actually it's funny,

173
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:59.270
he had a bunch of arguments with the proofreading staff,

174
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:03.650
especially at Houghton Mifflin, the American publisher who kept correcting it,

175
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.490
like the, the, the copy editors kept going back and changing it to dwarfs.

176
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.020
And they'd send him the proofs and he'd be like, guys, no, like, trust me.

177
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.580
Who's the professor here.

178
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.190
<v 1>Comes in from Kevin Hearn who asks,</v>

179
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.790
I never understood the urgency of hopping on the last boat to Valin,

180
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:21.500
or why was it the last boat?

181
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.530
This is almost certainly a Laura thing I missed in the books. Why couldn't,

182
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:28.460
Arwin just build a raft and head West later. And Hey, Frodo got on a boat.

183
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.200
Couldn't our windows made that one.

184
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.360
<v 0>So the boats in question are sailing from the havens of the elves</v>

185
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.040
and they are headed into the West Capitol w and when the world was

186
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.990
made round, the,

187
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.130
the far West was removed from the world.

188
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:47.870
You can't get there anymore,

189
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.710
but one straight path still remains.

190
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.030
That is straight in the sense of being tangential to this fear of the earth so

191
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.630
that the straight road leaves earth and goes to Valen,

192
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.060
or which has been taken apart into a separate place.

193
00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.780
It's no longer part of the purely physical world anymore,

194
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.960
but it is still part of art. Uh, and there is still a connection.

195
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:13.580
There is still this kind of umbilical cord between the world and Valentina,

196
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.990
and that, that path,

197
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.760
that straight road has been left explicitly in order that the

198
00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:24.440
elves who still remain in middle earth can still escape and go to the blessed

199
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:25.790
realm, go to Elvin home.

200
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.510
They're given by the Valor of the privilege of sailing on the straight road.

201
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.920
That's where Frodo and Bilbo with Gandalf and Elrond and the others who depart

202
00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:37.430
in the ship there from the Harbor at the end of the Lord of the rings,

203
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.010
that's where they're headed as for Arwin herself.

204
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.330
She does not get on a boat because she has chosen

205
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.600
mortality. The choice of Arwin is a really big deal.

206
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.630
Humans and elves have completely different fates.

207
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.000
What happens to elves at the end of the world, the world,

208
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.110
going to come to an end. And when it comes to an end, the elves had done,

209
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.280
did they all die or all elf souls annihilated at the end of ARDA,

210
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.400
they don't know. So the big deal,

211
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.050
when Arwin chooses to marry, Aragorn, it's an enormous deal.

212
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:09.160
She is leaving.

213
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:13.180
She has permitted the choice to leave the fate of elves.

214
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.320
She's she ceases to be an elf anymore. She becomes mortal.

215
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.380
She embraces mortality and a human fate.

216
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.150
And so therefore she is not going to be going into the West. And when she dies,

217
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.750
when her body dies, her spirit is not going to go into the West.

218
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.760
That's why such a big deal is made of the farewell between Elrond

219
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.020
and Arwin because he is going to go to [inaudible] and he's going to remain

220
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:42.370
there. His spirit will remain there even after his body dies, if his body dies,

221
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.220
uh, and Arwin is going to go wherever humans go.

222
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.370
<v 1>Stanton asks, is there a Jarrod talking book about the goblin and dwarf?</v>

223
00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:54.450
Great war. Excellent question to which the unfortunate answer is no.

224
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.390
<v 0>There is no such book, the longest description,</v>

225
00:12:57.391 --> 00:13:02.130
the most information we get about the war between the dwarves and the goblins or

226
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.350
orcs, uh, is in the last section of appendix a in the return of the King, uh,

227
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.640
is on the people of Durham.

228
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.570
And that's where we get the description of the battle of as a Newell bizarre,

229
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.010
uh, to use the dwarfish name for it. It's only about a one paragraph summary of,

230
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.330
of the war, uh, itself building up to that battle. That was the final battle.

231
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.283
In fact,

232
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.550
that section of appendix a has not only the most that we get about that war

233
00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:28.080
between the goblins and dwarves,

234
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.410
but it's also the most information we get about dwarves.

235
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.150
Full-stop we learn more in that section of appendix a then really we learn

236
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:37.290
anywhere else, including.

237
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.030
<v 1>A question from Jacob Williams. Isn't the marring of ARDA,</v>

238
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.670
the doing of Melcor and the raising of the hands of.

239
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.200
<v 0>The verses of the song,</v>

240
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.240
folding his grief to the reconciliation is so Milkar is the big,

241
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.900
bad of middle earth. And I mean, big, bad of middle earth.

242
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.620
He is essentially the Satan figure of, you know,

243
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:00.240
the entirety of Tolkien's world.

244
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.800
He is the second most powerful creature in existence. Second,

245
00:14:04.801 --> 00:14:09.420
only to God himself. Um, at least in the beginning, he was the second,

246
00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:13.110
most powerful. He rebelled against God. I get, uh,

247
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.460
paralleling the story of Satan in Christian tradition.

248
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:22.260
One of the chief differences between Tolkien's mythology and Christian

249
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.630
Judeo-Christian mythology is that toking describes Melcor

250
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.550
as having marred artists. So ARITA again is the whole world.

251
00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:36.810
It's the solar system and the entirety of the world has been

252
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.230
tainted essentially by milkers malice.

253
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:45.090
And that's why everything is tending towards a decay and tragedy.

254
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.590
That's basically why,

255
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.850
why do bad things happen to good people in middle earth milk or that's

256
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.800
arrow? The one, uh, Eluvia tar who has God,

257
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.800
he does respond to that, his message to milk,

258
00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:02.750
or is there is nothing that you can do that is ultimately going to mess

259
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:04.760
up my plan for the world.

260
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.440
And you will find that everything that you have done to try to mess up middle

261
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:14.420
earth is only going to end up contributing to the ultimate beauty

262
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.030
and glory of my creation. Um,

263
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:21.940
so tokens theology there is that God is still in charge.

264
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.950
Okay. Antonio asks,

265
00:15:23.951 --> 00:15:28.600
did Sarah just turn Newman or into a Melcor cult making human sacrifice in the

266
00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:31.630
name of the giver of freedom? Yes, yes. Antonio,

267
00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:35.110
that is exactly what sour on did. Siren was extremely cunning.

268
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.890
He could not compete with the Newman Koreans on a military basis.

269
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.910
So siren gives in, so they bring him back as a prisoner to Newman army.

270
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.390
And he does that because he really wants to go to Newman manure and he works on

271
00:15:46.391 --> 00:15:48.160
corrupting it from within. So yes,

272
00:15:48.161 --> 00:15:53.050
he turns Newman art into a devil worshiping cult and ultimately convinces them

273
00:15:53.051 --> 00:15:56.860
to attack the last enemy that they have not defeated the ones who have been

274
00:15:56.861 --> 00:15:58.480
doing them wrong all these years,

275
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:03.550
namely the elves and the Valor over in the West. It is really fun. Uh,

276
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.840
to talk about your questions,

277
00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:07.660
I really appreciate all the questions that you guys asked here today.

278
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.040
It's so interesting, of course,

279
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:12.400
that we're able to still talk about talking to have these kinds of debates and

280
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:16.750
discussions 80 years later. Well, I'm Cory Olson, the talking professor,

281
00:16:16.751 --> 00:16:18.670
and this has been talking support.
