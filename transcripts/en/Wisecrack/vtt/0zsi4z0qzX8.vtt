00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.370
<v 0>This video is brought to you by keeps</v>

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.050
What's up. Wisecrack Michael, here,

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.440
I have a confession to make about the team here at wisecrack.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.760
We're obsessed with cults, documentaries about cults even more.

5
00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:19.700
So now to be clear, we have no interest in joining one,

6
00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:24.020
as they are usually very bad and caused lots of psychological and often physical

7
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:24.800
harm to people.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.730
So it's probably no surprise that we've been mainlining episodes of the vow,

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.720
the recent series,

10
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:34.310
exploring a cult called Nexium and it's judo champion at 11 figurehead,

11
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:35.210
Keith Ranieri,

12
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.230
who sucks and was just sentenced to 120 years behind bars for some truly

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.480
horrific crimes for the uninitiated.

14
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.210
Nexium is one part in multi-level marketing scheme,

15
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.690
where you pay thousands of dollars to the leadership classes in hotel conference

16
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:51.560
rooms, and five parts, a cult where people were different colored sashes,

17
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.740
and sometimes branded themselves with Keith Raniere, his initials,

18
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:55.850
before sleeping with them.

19
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.840
Now this all grabbed my attention because people like to call her nary a

20
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.130
philosopher.

21
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.520
<v 1>I have as my mentor and American scientist and philosopher by the name of Keith</v>

22
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:05.150
Ranieri.

23
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.600
<v 0>And according to the university that gave me a PhD in the people who published</v>

24
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.450
my book. I am too no judo skills though.

25
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:13.280
I was pretty good at volleyball in high school.

26
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.810
So join me as I suspended my critical judgment and see what this smartest man

27
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.300
alive has to say. And maybe in the process,

28
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:24.140
we can figure out how a great big creep convinced everyone to mutilate

29
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:27.320
themselves for the love of knowledge. Let's go.

30
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.190
And before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to keeps.

31
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.400
I personally love my style. I love my hat collection and my sneakers.

32
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.640
Some people love to do their makeup or support their Supreme trim.

33
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.160
Others love styling their hair. And if that's you,

34
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.820
then I can totally see why losing your hair might seem like the end of the

35
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:50.090
world. I wouldn't panic though, because you can combat hair loss.

36
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.200

37

49
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.610
<v 1>There's no problem with the planet it's been stuck. We do,</v>

50
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.770
you will be as ethical as possible.

51
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.320
You will be that which you want to see in the world.

52
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.830
<v 0>Oh, says the grown man in the white sash.</v>

53
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.850
So this sounds straightforward enough if a little vague,

54
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.800
the thing that comes up again and again,

55
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.440
is that [inaudible] has this cool new form of ethics.

56
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.790
And it's going to transform the world. Many of his followers refer to him as,

57
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.090
I guess she made a turn I've ever met, but superly gives the side.

58
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.820
What does that even mean? Luckily, philosophers love defining terms.

59
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.870
Most broadly,

60
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.010
ethics defines good and bad behavior for the ancient Greeks like Plato or

61
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.873
Aristotle.

62
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.630
This meant living a virtuous life through your more modern utilitarian theorist.

63
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.450
It's the idea that we should take actions that will bring the most amount of

64
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:15.190
happiness to the most amount of people.

65
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.960
Another big player deontology argues that any good act must be

66
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:23.950
applied universally. There is no exceptions, like a line is bad,

67
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.500
except for when I'm lying to save a loved one from a murderer.

68
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.380
And of course there's someone like novelist, iron Rand,

69
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.820
who thought the pursuit of one's individual happiness was the only truly ethical

70
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:34.654
position.

71
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.600
<v 1>A lot of it is the philosophy of objectivism, which is Iran.</v>

72
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.220
<v 0>There it is Ranieri shares. Rand's individualist vision for the world,</v>

73
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.090
but I don't think reading the Fountainhead makes you the CEO of ethics anymore

74
00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:49.230
than reading the old man.

75
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.230
And the sea qualifies you to join the cast of deadliest catch.

76
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.100
<v 1>We should be building ethicists.</v>

77
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.350
People are going to elect ethicists to be present.

78
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.550
<v 0>Now,</v>

79
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.720
if we're going for people who pursue their own happiness should run society.

80
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.320
Well,

81
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.120
this basically already exists in the form of every venture capitalist and Karen

82
00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:16.020
at a Starbucks. Also, if we're going for a plagiarized iron Rand,

83
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.590
there's plenty of people in elected office who already espouse her views.

84
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.570
So not much to see here.

85
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.430
<v 1>An act of character,</v>

86
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.110
you feel all those emotions and there's a part of you that is unflappable.

87
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.840
Absolutely committed.

88
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.510
<v 0>Okay. Finally, getting a little more specific. Now this isn't a brand new idea.</v>

89
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.980
For example, philosopher,

90
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:42.900
Emmanuel Kant thought any real ethical act had to be disconnected from emotions.

91
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.260
So it's not about feeling like something is the right thing to do.

92
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.420
It's about knowing something is the right thing to do,

93
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.500
even if you absolutely do not feel like doing it. And to an extent,

94
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.810
this seems to be what Ranieri is getting at.

95
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.120
But the crucial difference is that for current,

96
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.260
these ethical acts have to be grounded in the principle of humanity,

97
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.910
meaning that we never use human beings as fodder for some bigger goal.

98
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.880
So a we're still saying it's a no-go on sexually.

99
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.130
<v 1>What civilization people working together based on principle to</v>

100
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:16.290
improve the nature of existence itself.

101
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.330
<v 0>It's the worst summer camp ever, but there's nothing too controversial here.</v>

102
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.350
Sigmund Freud,

103
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.350
the guy who made you feel creepy for loving your mother might say that

104
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:29.280
civilization helps us shove our instinctual desires into a deep pit.

105
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.950
So we can make this society loving part of our brain happy.

106
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.520
And other philosophers like John jock were so thought that the nature of human

107
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:39.060
civilization was putting the strengths of individuals together to collectively

108
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:40.170
achieve greater things.

109
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.790
So near his definition is both uncontroversial and kind of boring. All right,

110
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.653
what's next?

111
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.690
<v 1>There's that definition of how it's come to life, which is,</v>

112
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.363
I thought you knew

113
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.210
the definition of hell is you on the day that you're going to die,

114
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.390
how you are meeting that you, you could have been.

115
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.930
That's a really good one.

116
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.610
<v 0>They say philosophy begins in condescension,</v>

117
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.360
but unlike handing out colorful sashes to your underlings,

118
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.980
this is actually a cool idea.

119
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.060
It's also something most first-year philosophy students would recognize as not

120
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.600
very original Friedrich Nietzsche, who didn't even know what volleyball was.

121
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.750
Describe something like this as a love of fate.

122
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.310
Basically he imagined living your life on repeat Groundhog day style to the end

123
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:32.110
of eternity. If that sounds like a bummer,

124
00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:35.530
you're probably not stoked on your life choices or on the prospect of repeating

125
00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:38.860
them forever. But if you truly embrace your life and your actions,

126
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:42.190
you might be stoked to do it all over again. And again, and again,

127
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.450
we're narrows ideas, just a rhetorical twist instead of pondering,

128
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:49.450
whether you're going to suffer eternally as you relive your choices,

129
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.230
you instead just get to meet the person who made the best version of themselves.

130
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.580
So I mean sure, but both bill Murray and Nisha said it better.

131
00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.013
Moving on.

132
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.320
<v 1>It is true for you. So therefore it is true to some degree</v>

133
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.720
for me.

134
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.010
<v 0>This looks like he's really getting into the philosophy of why you never,</v>

135
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.090
never questioned me.

136
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.200
And it's interesting as coronary is varying into the territory of what we call

137
00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:18.040
post-modernism or perspectivism these theorists argue that there is no such

138
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.080
thing as fixed or objective truth,

139
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.440
but the truth is dependent on our experience and perspective and that different

140
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:26.080
individuals could have different experiences of the same events.

141
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.020
This idea has been explored by Nicha Jacques Derrida,

142
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.800
and Jean-Francois leotard to advocate that we be skeptical about just how

143
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:37.030
amazing and all-knowing human beings can actually be people in this camp to

144
00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:37.930
varying degrees,

145
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.560
argue that there is no one objective truth that transcends culture,

146
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.880
context or perspective,

147
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.560
but this doesn't mean whatever is true for me is my truth. You dig instead,

148
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:51.070
it means that we need to be humble enough to acknowledge that different people

149
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.100
will have different perspectives and views with their own biases,

150
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.960
even when experiencing the same event, text or discount buffet, of course,

151
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:03.130
for context here and Neri is using this idea to Gaslight a group of women

152
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.070
carefully expressing their concerns about his behavior.

153
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.710
And that's absolutely not cool.

154
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.520
<v 1>So views is a made up human construct.</v>

155
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.540
And a lot of times the screaming of abuse is abuse in itself.

156
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.450
<v 0>So we can just say it now, right? This guys is just a piece of,</v>

157
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.360
I think we can just say it. You guys see it. I see it. We can switch and say,

158
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:22.690
okay,

159
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.550
so what is doing here is playing Madlibs with postmodern language for

160
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:31.720
philosophers like Derrida postmodernism was a way to rethink how certain we can

161
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:33.190
really be about human knowledge.

162
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.690
It was not a way to tell people they were wrong for feeling abused or

163
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:38.440
victimized.

164
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.160
Ranieri is peddling in exactly the type of that postmodernism has been

165
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:45.340
criticized for by those who frankly, didn't read the books.

166
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.610
So what else does judo man have for us?

167
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.350
<v 1>Primitive parts of us are hungry. Beasties. I mean,</v>

168
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:56.250
that's what we want to do. Oh, okay. Um.

169
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.520
<v 0>I almost don't want to give this idea at the time of day,</v>

170
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.930
but he seems to be veering into the realm of someone like Thomas Hobbes,

171
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:08.250
who thought the human state of nature is one of all out war where we do whatever

172
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:10.910
we can to eat, screw and survive. However,

173
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.730
philosophers ranging from Plato to Aristotle, to cot, to contemporary figures,

174
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:18.720
like a long bed Jews have argued that to think of ourselves as crass animals is

175
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:23.340
to miss what makes humans interesting, namely our capacity for reason,

176
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.060
and our ability to seek truth Khan says that if we were just meant to eat,

177
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:28.440
sleep and screw the nature,

178
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:32.100
did a job at designing us because we're also neurotic and curious,

179
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:35.970
and anxious and reflective all things that don't really help our animals

180
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:39.750
survival, even primatologists who studied the behavior of primates,

181
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.440
gorillas and stuff reject the idea that primates are just murderous,

182
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:44.274
violent freaks.

183
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.720
There's plenty of evidence that our thumbless cousins also work together and to

184
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.580
have hot consensual relations.

185
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.380
So current actual scientists and many others would say that refineries over

186
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:59.970
identification of humans with primitive Beasties is woefully inadequate.

187
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.720
It also creates a dangerous paradigm in which people can do really bad things

188
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:08.430
and justify it because they're just hungry Beasties. Okay.

189
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.780
We're almost done, but we have one more gem to consider.

190
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.500
I wrote a fable once that started that there was a mighty King

192
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.010
that took over a culture. Wow.

193
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.450
<v 0>Dude wrote a fable.</v>

194
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.760
<v 1>And this King used torture and fear to create a BDO</v>

195
00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:29.594
once.

196
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.610
<v 0>Sounds kind of like a co-leader who collects blackmail on his followers.</v>

197
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.590
<v 1>And over time,</v>

198
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.700
people found that if they just abate what the King said,

199
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.590
there was peace across the land.

200
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.330
But what they sacrificed for that was their traditions, their customs,

201
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.890
and all of their identity.

202
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.910
The threat of violence was enough to keep social order.

203
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.570
But if the King went and killed everyone,

204
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.520
then he would have to do all the work.

205
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.500
So the people who are being victimized have a certain

206
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:07.160
power and they can stand against the King.

207
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.960
<v 0>Okay. Um, where to begin with this one, um, first of all,</v>

208
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.280
he didn't write a fable once he's as much ASAP as he is not a sociopath.

209
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.090
The basic gist here is powerful. People use that power to the Lord over others,

210
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.910
but they often need the powerless to maintain their own power,

211
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.270
not in original or new, of course, special or interesting idea,

212
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.170
but philosophically it's a watered down version of Hegel's master,

213
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:31.220
slave dialectic,

214
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.720
which is a fable that explains the structure of human consciousness and also

215
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.670
everything else for Hagle,

216
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.110
the master Lords over his slaves to feel powerful and their recognition of him

217
00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:43.970
as the master confirms this feeling.

218
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.810
But eventually the slaves realized that they actually do a lot more than their

219
00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:50.870
master and that without them he's basically useless.

220
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.820
And the master realizes that he's actually dependent on them to feel all

221
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:59.650
powerful and special. So voila, we had a reversal of power now for Hagle.

222
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:04.120
This explains a concept called mutual recognition where both sides realize

223
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.600
they're neutral interdependence for scenario. This means that, um,

224
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.010
if everyone in his cult locked out, he'd be left powerless, but they haven't.

225
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:13.870
So everything's chill. Okay.

226
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:18.340
So what have we learned by suspending our judgment to momentarily consider the

227
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:21.010
philosophy of a real life piece of? Well,

228
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.400
[inaudible] modus operandi seems pretty simple. Step one,

229
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.970
take some relatively basic uncontroversial ideas. Step two,

230
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.210
rephrase them to make yourself sound smart and original and step three,

231
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.380
use these original ideas to justify your sadistic and manipulative agenda and

232
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:38.380
convince your followers to do stuff like separate ties with their loved ones and

233
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:41.410
enter into master slave relationships with their friends,

234
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.220
interrogating the tradition for insights and how to live a good and virtuous

235
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:47.140
life. This is not well,

236
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.770
that's it for our philosophical journey into the mind of a sociopathic cult

237
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:51.130
leader.

238
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.760
And hopefully this is a good reminder that if someone is trying to get you to

239
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:57.130
pay lots of money, to join their philosophical movement,

240
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.280
you should run as fast as you can in the opposite direction and never look back

241
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.420
seriously.

242
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.800
If a philosophical education is what you seek simply visit your local library.

243
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.840
We mentioned books all the time in our videos,

244
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.130
so go check them out and please let us know what you think of this new format in

245
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:14.410

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.410
which is something we all need these days. Right? Huge.
