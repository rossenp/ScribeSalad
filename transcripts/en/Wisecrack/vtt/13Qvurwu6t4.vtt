00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.350
<v 0>What's up guys, Helen here,</v>

2
00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:10.580
wondering how long it's been since I partied share to drink or just hugged

3
00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:14.630
somebody I don't live with. Of course, if you're a resident of the hype house,

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.460
the answer is five seconds ago.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.310
And also you just stuck your tongue in a stranger's mouth.

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.100
Indeed amidst the cultural backlash of the pandemic.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.390
A certain class of famous people online influencers have reached new Heights of

8
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:29.600
media attention simply by refusing to stay the hell home.

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.170
But even before the unplanned demic hit online,

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.190
influencers have been settling dabbing, lip, sinking unboxing,

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.870
and pranking their way into increasingly bigger spotlights all while rewriting

12
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:46.340
the rules of 21st century celebrity they're often dismissed as not deserving

13
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:50.750
fame or being grossly self-promoting or for being very bad people who are

14
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:54.380
officially uninvited to my birthday party. But as tech talk star,

15
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:58.640
Charlie Emilio's recent ascendance to the big screen of the Dunkin donuts menu

16
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:02.060
proves that's not stopping them. So how did we end up here?

17
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.100
What's the deal are influencers,

18
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:08.090
just a slightly different form of celebrity or something more nefarious going

19
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:12.080
on. Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on influencers,

20
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.550
what went wrong. But first in true influencer fashion,

21
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.320
we wanted to do a little self promo.

22
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.100
Right now you can grab the t-shirt I'm wearing and a bunch of other cool designs

23
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:25.220
on the wisecrack store. We just did a big update.

24
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:30.020
So even if you visited before, now's the time to check it out. We have dad hats,

25
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.430

26
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:36.350
channel in style by visiting wisecrack,

27
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.990
that store or hitting the first link in the description.

28
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.200
We appreciate your support. Yeah. And hope you like the new merge.

29
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.000
Now back to the show, this might not be a shocker, but fame is not new.

30
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.510
There's something unique about how fame became live, streaming yourself,

31
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:51.950
lighting your mattress on fire.

32
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.910
We're terrorizing the people of Tokyo with an octopus tentacle and to figure out

33
00:01:55.911 --> 00:02:00.590
why we need to talk about this guy, Alexander, the third of Mastodon,

34
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.240
or as you know him, Alexander the great this fourth century King was great.

35
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:09.410
Not because he dropped 200 racks on this car at the age of nine, but instead,

36
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:14.270
because he created the world's largest empire in just 13 years, but a scholar,

37
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:18.620
Leo Brody writes in his book, the frenzy of renown fame and its history.

38
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.780
That's not why we still know his name.

39
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.180
It's because he was the first famous person.

40
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.290
How did this smelly warrior rise above all the Kings before and after him while

41
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:30.500
our boy Alex had an almost superhuman craving for more land,

42
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.520
he also had the Cunnington know that the most valuable real estate was in the

43
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:35.390
minds of those.

44
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.530
He ruled he was obsessed with carefully cultivating his reputation,

45
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.730
claiming to be descended from the gods and modeling himself after the brave

46
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.280
warriors from Homer's poetry in Athens,

47
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.900
he was officially named a God and not just in a Morgan Freeman kind of way.

48
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.880
And in some ways, Alexander nailed the basics of fame that persist to this day,

49
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.680
like Billy McFarland, inviting hot people to fire Island,

50
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.460
Alexander understood the importance of visual representation.

51
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.210
That's always been crucial to fame because if people are going to worship you,

52
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.270
they generally have to know approximately what you look like.

53
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.640
If you're tracking the evolution of celebrities,

54
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.540
it helps to look at the visual mediums that define them in the public eye.

55
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.250
Alexander was super picky about how he was portrayed visually only allowing his

56
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.910
three favorite artists to depict him from life. They typically did.

57
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:27.670
So in a way that evoked Helios the sun, God,

58
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.280
because ancient Greece wasn't the time for modesty.

59
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.660
And whereas coins were once the exclusive realm of gods and mythical heroes,

60
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.410
Alexander was the first to stamp his own pretty face on currency.

61
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.050
So sure Alexander was a legend,

62
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.100
but he was also kind of a regular dude who ate with his troops and fought

63
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:48.850
alongside them. This is another theme we'll see throughout our history of fame.

64
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.140
Famous people are often larger than life yet also relatable folks.

65
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:56.590
You can share a beer or a goblet with his legacy.

66
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:58.330
As a conqueror was cemented.

67
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.540
As he spawned the first ever wave of biographic books.

68
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.900
Here was a guy whose story was truly worth telling,

69
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.750
but Alexander wasn't alone in his early fame,

70
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.200
ancient Greek and Roman culture was full of fame, hungry folks,

71
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:15.520
doing impressive things to inspire poets, to write about them. But in Rome,

72
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.390
in particular,

73
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.350
everything was about performance and leading a public life in the name of

74
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:22.540
personal glory and civic duty.

75
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.460
The writer Cicero even tried to pen an Epic poem about himself,

76
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.410
deeply charismatic Roman leader,

77
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.150
Julius Caesar outdid the rest with his obsession with triumphant parades and

78
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:35.860
elaborate gladiator shows.

79
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.420
What's more Cesar was the first soldier to write a narrative war memoir.

80
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.000
And apparently as he laid dying,

81
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.170
rearranged his Toga as one final act of image control. Now,

82
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.540
Caesar was not an influencer selling.

83
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.370
<v 1>His bathwater that we know.</v>

84
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.630
<v 0>That's partly because consumer society was still a millennia or two away.</v>

85
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.850
And at this time, celebrity was mostly about big men doing big things, you know,

86
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.120
conquering and leading and so forth. But as culture has changed,

87
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.710
so would fame and keep in mind fame hasn't consistently been in Vogue.

88
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.760
That's thanks mostly to this guy who switched things up in the first century,

89
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:17.350
a D by living humbly avoiding publicity and promising mad glory in the

90
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:20.470
afterlife. Naturally celebrity culture took a bit of a dip,

91
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.150
but certainly didn't disappear.

92
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.410
And fame would eventually smash through the confines set by Christianity and

93
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.310
further expand beyond Kings and rulers with the Renaissance.

94
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.840
See the Renaissance brought the rise of portrait painting and the printed page,

95
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.830
both of which began circulating images of people all over Europe.

96
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.780
This moment was all about the individual and with that his or her fame

97
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.100
as Brody puts it.

98
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.720
Everyone who made a career in public was being made to realize how both art and

99
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:54.070
printing could make it more symbolic, more essential and more powerful.

100
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.250
What's more portrait seem to scratch that itch that everyone has to be

101
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:02.900
remembered and to have their individual essence captured as Leon Battista

102
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.190
Alberti wrote in the 15th century, the face of a man who was already dead,

103
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.680
certainly lives a long life through painting.

104
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.750
This frenzy meant the rise of more and more people being memorialized with a

105
00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:18.670
paintbrush. The best example though, still comes from a Monarch queen Elizabeth.

106
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:23.170
The first of England who was self-consciously curating her brand more than 400

107
00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:26.380
years before you downloaded Bisco in a turbulent time,

108
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.810
Elizabeth fiercely controlled her own image,

109
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.740
sending out pre-approved portraits all over the kingdom to be copied by

110
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.603
artisans.

111
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.840
She even issued a proclamation to have all unapproved paintings destroyed

112
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.200
though.

113
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.640
It apparently wasn't enforced while monarchs weren't sponsored by red bull. The,

114
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.270
um,

115
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.470
bold fashion choices of royalty certainly trickled down through the aristocracy.

116
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.520
If the Renaissance expanded access to fame beyond Kings and Queens,

117
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.670
the 18th century absolutely exploded it.

118
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.880
The combined French and American revolutions trumpeted,

119
00:06:57.881 --> 00:07:02.350
the democratic man and the slew of such men like the founding fathers were

120
00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:05.470
thoroughly obsessed with their legacy. Likewise,

121
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.880
post revolutionary war Americans were eager to celebrate them with dumb legends

122
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:12.130
like that. Cherry tree thing in America.

123
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.600
Celebrity has always been far more democratic centering itself around the

124
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.710
individual who seems to possess that special spark, a spark,

125
00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:24.790
which simultaneously the spectator could believe that they to possess.

126
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.830
And so not unlike any given selfie challenge portraits depicted the so-called

127
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.630
democratic man via images like this of the low key homely, Ben Franklin,

128
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.670
meanwhile books, pamphlets, portraits, and caricatures circulated like mad,

129
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.870
bringing evermore faces and writings to the masses and providing evermore

130
00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:47.170
avenues for fame, concurrently fandom. As we know,

131
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:50.350
it really started to begin as philosopher. John jock,

132
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.610
Russo grumpily recounted people who had never read his books would come from

133
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:57.790
miles away to gab with the man famous for his intellect,

134
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.850
strangeness and striking adoption of Armenian fashion.

135
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.060
Needless to say ever enjoyed these conversations,

136
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.510
still imitating the look of your favorite French philosopher.

137
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.340
It wasn't possible for most people until the 19th century when the industry sure

138
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:13.810
revolution brought the fast,

139
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:18.730
cheap mass production of imagery and of ready-made clothes, shoes, cigarettes,

140
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.623
et cetera,

141
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:24.100
fashion suddenly took off whole new layer that of personal identity

142
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.360
and folks often dress to impress by copying images of famous people.

143
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.410
They get their hair cut like Lord Byron, or wear gloves like prime minister,

144
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.630
Benjamin Disraeli and coincidentally,

145
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.950
this brought about first the rise of the Nandy due to dress like famous

146
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:39.670
aristocrats,

147
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.900
even though they often weren't and a huge number of people being brought to

148
00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:48.160
insane asylums for claiming to be Napoleon still. When it came to fame,

149
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.270
the most profound change of the century was the arrival of photography,

150
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.980
which democratize the right to see your own sexy on paper.

151
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.030
It said that Lincoln credits his success as much to a widely circulated

152
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:04.650
photograph of him as he did to any awesome speech he ever gave the photograph,

153
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.120
made him both accessible and someone to emulate the simultaneous rise of

154
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:13.830
journalism provided a place to celebrate the newly anointed masses of the famous

155
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.600
and the arrival of gossip columns.

156
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.170
Let you find out what your favorite general was eating or what snarky things he

157
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:23.550
was saying about his enemies in this way, by the end of the 19th century,

158
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.540
celebrity had basically stopped being primarily about heroic achievements,

159
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.800
like an Alexander the Great's case, and started to really be about identity,

160
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.300
how that identity is expressed and how it can be mimicked by adoring fans.

161
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.830
Like when queen Victoria popularize the poofy white wedding dress that for some

162
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:44.040
inexplicable reason is still with us today. At this point,

163
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.070
there were more ways to become famous than ever before,

164
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.570
but one development would blow our concepts of celebrity out of the water,

165
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.360
the rise of the motion picture. Well,

166
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:57.000
early film actors weren't even named in the credits.

167
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.230
It only took 14 years for a bonafide star system to form.

168
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.710
Whereas theater actors had been achieving various amounts of fame.

169
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.090
Since the 16th century,

170
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.590
the movie actor was something different projected on a giant screen,

171
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.160
their emotions and their individuality were far more accessible.

172
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.620
And people felt instantly in love,

173
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.550
much the way they would with YouTube star and pathological tattoo collector.

174
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:24.750
Justin Bieber her much of Hollywood history, most famous stars were women,

175
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.460
and they were mostly naturalistic performers appearing to portray themselves on

176
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:33.360
screen and portraying sensationalized versions of themselves in the gossip

177
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:34.890
columns. As a result,

178
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.120
the connection between an early movie fan and their favorite star was intimate,

179
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.500
almost possessive.

180
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.550
It's no wonder that movie stars soon began to have their clothes ripped by mobs

181
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:49.170
of rabid fans. What's more because anybody can technically play themselves.

182
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.920
Movies made the most glamorous kind of celebrity seemed like it was just one

183
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:57.120
killer audition away, further democratizing our collective concept of fame.

184
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.890
According to movie critic and author Burr above all the movies propagated,

185
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:06.480
the idea that you didn't really matter unless you were seen and seen,

186
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.160
they were Charlie Chaplin emerged as one of the first worldwide recognizable

187
00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:16.020
faces his trans continental railway tour attracting mobs of adoring fans,

188
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.030
notably and uniquely Charlie made eye contact in his films as if to

189
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:23.880
emphasize his own accessibility to the audience.

190
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.350
Still most movie stars were both relatable and inaccessible in their glimmer

191
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:28.831
people.

192
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:33.390
You could go to the theater and dream of emulating and as they did consumer

193
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:37.440
spending and the leisure industry exploded as more and more people used

194
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:40.530
commodities and personal style to imitate the stars.

195
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:45.390
This wasn't some random by-product consumption is key to the idea of the

196
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:48.000
modern celebrity as P David Marshall puts it.

197
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.920
Celebrity taught generations how to engage and use consumer culture to make

198
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.310
this was literalized in the form of celebrity endorsement,

199
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.190
which began to really boom in the 1920s,

200
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.870
subsequently every development that affected the film industry from the rise of

201
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.940
the talking picture to the rise of people,

202
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:11.620
magazine to the rise of hell on earth has brought stars closer to us,

203
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.360
making them more accessible,

204
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.830
but perhaps nothing changed the possibilities of celebrity more than this.

205
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.850
<v 2>Good thing. It turned on that TV. Lisa that's right.</v>

206
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.620
<v 0>Wait the television. While the big screen bred reliably glamorous stars,</v>

207
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.650
TV, which rapidly took over America,

208
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.230
provided the space for a different kind of celebrity.

209
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.800
The TV star was even more accessible and democratized.

210
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.290
The regularity of television programs,

211
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.020
bred familiarity intensifying.

212
00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:44.700
The sense that you really know the star is a person most emblematic of early TV.

213
00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:46.170
Fame is Lucille ball.

214
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.360
A then B list movie actress who was a non Hollywood approved 40 years old when

215
00:12:51.361 --> 00:12:52.260
her show started.

216
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.120
I love Lucy was about a woman who wanted to be a star thus as Burr

217
00:12:57.121 --> 00:12:57.954
explains,

218
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.250
it explored the distance between the average person and fame and the pain of

219
00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:04.710
that desire for celebrity coming up short,

220
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.950
such themes were doubtless very relatable to an America,

221
00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:10.830
still absorbing the implications of Hollywood fame.

222
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.490
But as TV contributed to the destruction of the studio system,

223
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.300
we also saw the parallel rise of new Hollywood and with it,

224
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:23.130
the quote unquote common man in film exemplified by the likes of Dustin Hoffman

225
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.180
and gene Hackman,

226
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.340
we'd come a long way since the most famous people were Kings and Queens as

227
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.950
famous came entirely about being watchable.

228
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.360
Celebrity became an accessible dream for anyone with that special something.

229
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:41.010
But the single biggest step in this process may have been the arrival of reality

230
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.600
television developed in the late 1980s when TV studios were slashing

231
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:46.350
costs,

232
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.970
reality TV emerged as a cheap production model that banked on nameless talent.

233
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.140
But by the early odds, it was dominating the medium beginning,

234
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:59.400
a cycle of everyday people being made famous before being cast aside for the

235
00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:01.620
next set of freshly tan faces.

236
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.090
If a glamorous silent movie star inspired the desire to imitate and the more

237
00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:09.240
accessible Lucy inspired relate-ability reality,

238
00:14:09.241 --> 00:14:13.800
TV inspired a more total identification with the stars in front of us.

239
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.730
They formerly nobodies we're. Now somebody on our screens,

240
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.530
they exemplified the paradox of celebrity being extraordinary wellbeing,

241
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.180
totally ordinary. And unlike being born, the son of Phillip of Mastodon,

242
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.040
anyone could allegedly end up being.

243
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.210
<v 2>I met him through a good neutral friend of mine, a grinder.</v>

244
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.840
<v 0>Most importantly, reality TV confirmed the suspicions.</v>

245
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.320
Each of us secretly harbors that we deserve fame too.

246
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.550
And what's more that we could achieve it. If only we could dance saying,

247
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.420
or sit in a giant walk of ice in a compelling way, scholar, Mark,

248
00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:50.670
Andrea Vick argues that ironically,

249
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.370
the increased democratization of fame after this a convenient collective fantasy

250
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:58.280
during a time of increasing economic inequality,

251
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.750
the idea that we could strike it rich on the voice was a cheery antidote to the

252
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:04.820
fact that we can barely afford rent.

253
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.930
But before fame could turn into watching Tauna mojo, self emulated,

254
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:11.960
her dumb boot, late VidCon, there was still one step left.

255
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.810
We had to not only aspire to celebrity,

256
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.070
we had to become obsessed with the process of celebrity making, you know,

257
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.180
like watching a viral star shoot to fame before ruining his young career by

258
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.860
making fun of a dead guy in a Fort.

259
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.540
<v 3>Well, did we just find a dead person in the suicide forest.</v>

260
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.740
<v 0>And then watching the train wreck of that person continually trying to revive</v>

261
00:15:32.741 --> 00:15:34.390
their career with PR stunts.

262
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.560
This is what scholar Tim mole calls a hypertrophic celebrity culture.

263
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.070
That is to say a culture in which we're far more obsessed with,

264
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.750
say the process of the Pauls or the Kardashians becoming famous and the

265
00:15:46.751 --> 00:15:51.220
mechanisms of how they achieve that fame than we are with any one particular

266
00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:52.054
celebrity.

267
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.800
This process is literally baked into the model of most popular reality shows

268
00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.190
like American idol or the voice, or America's next top model.

269
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:02.260
And so on in this era,

270
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.310
celebrities like the Kardashians become more admired for their shrewd image

271
00:16:06.311 --> 00:16:10.090
control for how they handle and enhance their celebrity than for any other

272
00:16:10.091 --> 00:16:14.950
talents or abilities. I'd still don't understand how Paris Hilton got so famous.

273
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.020
But by asking that very question,

274
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.130
I'm probably contributing to this hypertrophic celebrity culture, of course,

275
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.530
watching the process of a normie or a hotel,

276
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.120
era's become a capital C celebrity got a lot easier with the widespread use of

277
00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:31.870
the internet. And later social media, since then college student,

278
00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:35.770
Jennifer Ringley finagled a so-called Jenny cam that took pictures of her room

279
00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:38.200
every three minutes, basically inventing blogging.

280
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.910
The internet has increasingly become a space for staging our everyday lives even

281
00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:46.510
more so than the idea that anyone is one audition away from fame.

282
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.900
The internet has brought us the idea that any one is one tick talker,

283
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.930
long away from the highest echelons of internet startup.

284
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.560
The internet also offers the potential for the micro celebrity.

285
00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.420
That is someone who is extremely famous to a very specific group of people like

286
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.190
makeup or gaming enthusiasts.

287
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.450
Whereas we've always suspected that film stars were playing a perhaps heightened

288
00:17:07.451 --> 00:17:12.040
version of themselves on screen internet start-up is predicated on a strangely

289
00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:15.220
performative sense of authenticity fittingly.

290
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.480
Some of the biggest stars of the internet era from the Paul brothers to the mojo

291
00:17:19.481 --> 00:17:21.790
sisters are ordinary everyday.

292
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.410
People who happen to be good at playing themselves and happened to become famous

293
00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:29.320
for it because of this supposedly authenticity,

294
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.300
more so than any celebrity before them influencers cultivate an intense pair of

295
00:17:34.301 --> 00:17:36.160
social relationship with fans.

296
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.360
That is a one-sided relationship in which the fan gives love,

297
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:45.250
likes an emotional investment while the famous guy gives very little in return

298
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.790
other than an occasional thank you to my fans authenticity.

299
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.130
Plus the strength of the parasocial relationship happens to make influencers

300
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.150
perhaps more so than glamorous movie stars. Excellent salespeople,

301
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.850
particularly when it comes to chicken nugget pillows.

302
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.990
It's no wonder every corporation from Adidas to McDonald's has taken note.

303
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.670
Fittingly influencers are also the embodiment of this hypertrophic celebrity

304
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:09.360
culture,

305
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.800
where your success at achieving fame in the form of views or followers or a

306
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:18.330
movie deal becomes far more impressive and fascinating than any actual talents

307
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.164
you may possess.

308
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.550
That's why every influencer seems to inevitably celebrate earning 1 million

309
00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:26.430
followers by doing something loony as a culture.

310
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.530
We're fascinated by this form of fame,

311
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.850
precisely because it seems to be just one successful Instagram post away.

312
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.290
The logical extension of the democratization of fame that's been going on since

313
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:41.730
the Renaissance celebrity was once an aspiration to go down in history for your

314
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:46.620
deeds or to improve your city standing or to secure your kingship today,

315
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.570
fame and the spending habits.

316
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.530
It can provoke amongst fans is the point in and of itself.

317
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.270
This can lead some click hungry influencers to make some very dumb choices.

318
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.260
Every evolution in media has made us collectively more visible.

319
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.610
Being seen by millions has never felt more accessible or more important.

320
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.140
That's likely to continue.

321
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.310
And just as the photograph allowed more people than ever to become more visible

322
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.140
and thus more famous than ever,

323
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.590
it's never been easier to get eyeballs on your face. However,

324
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.200
with each subsequent rise in the number of celebrities,

325
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.730
the entire concept of celebrity starts to become devalued and eye-roll inducing

326
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.410
basically more celebrities means fewer have staying power and nearly all are

327
00:19:28.411 --> 00:19:33.150
faded to quickly become passe in a process that is either sad or sadly

328
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:36.270
funny, depending on how much of a jerk you are. Now.

329
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.180
We're not saying to quit posting to your dog's Instagram,

330
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.450
but do it for the joy of sharing vandals, sexy mug,

331
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.000
not with the hope of landing her a deal with puppy chow,

332
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.560
but what do you guys think is the contemporary form of celebrity making us all

333
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:54.270
fame craze monsters, or is the democratization of fame actually empowering?
