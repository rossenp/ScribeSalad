<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.600
<v 1>It's time to get one of the most divisive comedians. Adam Sandler,</v>

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.880
a lot of critics have dismissed Sandler as the low point of modern comedy.

4
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.320
His films have been called juvenile amateurish, lazy and just plain awful.

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.510
After years of vicious criticism,

6
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.550
Sandler says he no longer even reads zoned reviews saying so I did stop

7
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:30.440
reading them. It didn't, it makes sense to me.

8
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:33.920
And it screwed my thinking up a little bit. When we were writing the next one,

9
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:37.100
me and my buddy were like, you think they're going to hate this. If we do this.

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.880
And we started saying, what's the difference? The only time Sandler gets here,

11
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.600
even a modicum of critical respect is when he steps out of his comfort zone and

12
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.010
takes on meatier roles.

13
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.240
But even then critics use these films as further proof of Sandler's laziness.

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.100
The implication seems to be, if he's capable of such a nuanced performances,

15
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.460
why has he squandered his talents in tasteless comedies?

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.640
This same pattern repeated itself just last year,

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.900
Sandler started one of his most critically acclaimed films yet uncut gems,

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.680
many even thought Sandler deserves an Academy award nomination for his

19
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:10.460
performance,

20
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.020
but critics still painted uncut gems as a rare exception in Sandler's career.

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.620
A brief bright spot admits his usual dumpster fires. However,

22
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.710
we here at wisecrack think the opposite uncut gems.

23
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.320
Isn't a rare exception in Sandler's filmography,

24
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.890
rather it's the culmination of Sandler's entire career.

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.930
That is to say Sandler's passwords. Billy Madison grownups, Mr. Deeds, and yes,

26
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.580
even Jack and Jill were merely covert preparation for his best role

27
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:41.900
yet. So welcome to this wisecrack edition on the genius of Adam Sandler,

28
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.250
spoilers ahead for uncut gems and a few classic Sandler comics. Well,

29
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:47.090
before we get into it,

30
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:50.510

51
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.480
Now let's get back to the show on the surface.

52
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.410
Uncut gems seems like a pretty big departure for the Sandman in the film.

53
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:57.440
Sandler stars as Howard Ratner, a diamond district jeweler,

54
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.510
always looking to make a quick buck this time from a glitzy Ethiopian Opal

55
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.530
problem is Howard's a gambling.

56
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.360
<v 2>You take lightening beds, but you don't want any part of lightening.</v>

57
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.550
Cause come on a thousand dollars a point, okay?

58
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.240
<v 1>Yes.</v>

59
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.990
Already in the hole for a hundred grand who was loan shark brother-in-law Arno.

60
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.560
After approximately 90 minutes of blood pressure raising shenanigans,

61
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.040
Howard sells the oval to NBA player. Kevin Garnett as a good luck charm,

62
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.310
but instead of using this cash to pay off his debts immediately,

63
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.130
Howard bets big on the Celtics, believing Garnett will have.

64
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.410
<v 2>The great game. There's a bet in that bag.</v>

65
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.760
I want you to take on all of it inside the bag and place it on that.

66
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.950
<v 1>And locks are no one is goons behind Bulletproof glass in his store to watch</v>

67
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.963
other game plays out.

68
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.240
The bet appears to pay off the Celtics win and Howard scores.

69
00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:46.020
The millions he's been after, but it's too late. When he unlocks the door.

70
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.910
Arno's goons are so fed up by his antics.

71
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:49.740
They shoot him dead and robbed his jewelry store.

72
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.020
Not the typical Sandler happy ending.

73
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.130
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

74
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.400
<v 1>If you haven't seen this film, it is very good.</v>

75
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.240
Like a two hour long panic attack that you somehow remember fondly.

76
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.470
It's also a dark gritty drama was not a single scatological joke or pratfall to

77
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:10.710
be found. And it's two hour plus runtime yet. There's one thing.

78
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:13.800
Uncut gems shares with all of Sandler's previous films.

79
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.480
See throughout Sandler's career, he's cultivated one specific comedic persona,

80
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.840
no matter the role, be it a wealthy air or water boy,

81
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.070
the son of Satan or a diamond district to jeweler each Sandler character is

82
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:30.750
essentially the same and emotionally stunted Manchild in 1970 scholar

83
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:32.610
philosopher in union psychoanalysts,

84
00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:36.870
Marie Louis Von Franz identified a growing trend in young men there refuse to

85
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:37.704
grow the FM.

86
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.690
This persona is called the pure attorneys Latin for the eternal child in her

87
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:42.961
book.

88
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:47.280
The problem of the pure attorneys Von France stated the man who identified with

89
00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:51.120
the archetype of the pure attorneys remains too long and adolescent psychology.

90
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.560
That is all those characteristics that are normal in youth of 17 or 18 or

91
00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.180
continued into later life.

92
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.690
It's worth noting that the problem of the pure attorneys came out right on the

93
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:05.130
heels of the 1960s, a decade defined by the sudden emergence of youth culture,

94
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.480
the youth of the 1960s rebelled against previous generations rejecting

95
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:10.291
traditional norms,

96
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:13.530
like the nine to five and mingle duties and not dropping acid,

97
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.530
being young and carefree became idealized in pop culture.

98
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:20.070
And people began holding onto their youth for far longer than was traditionally

99
00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:23.970
acceptable. Cue the mantra, according to Von Franz,

100
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.910
most man children share the same basic characteristics.

101
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.210
They struggled to maintain long lasting jobs and are unable to find a place in

102
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.000
society because they refuse to adapt to social norms.

103
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.780
Instead they sit around and do pretty much nothing to quote Von Franz.

104
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.810
The pure attorneys' lives in a continual sleepy days.

105
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.890
The sleepy on disciplined long leg of youth who merely hangs around his mind,

106
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:47.670
wandering indiscriminately so that sometimes one feels inclined to pour a bucket

107
00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:49.170
of cold water over his head.

108
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.830
These men are often quite arrogant to quality that stems from an inferiority

109
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:54.990
complex and false feelings of superiority.

110
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.330
These men are also attracted to women who can their mother who can in fold them

111
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.550
in her arms and satisfy their every need.

112
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.910
And they're prone to dangerous acts and sports because they yearn to get away

113
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:07.520
from reality from the earth from ordinary life.

114
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.910
Whether you accept Von Francis take on modern manhood or not,

115
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.110
you can probably see how Adam Sandler's early characters uniformly fit this

116
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:15.830
description.

117
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.220
It's important to note that Sandler isn't just a work for hire comedian.

118
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.510
He's also a co-writer on almost all of the work in his lower brow oeuvre. Thus,

119
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:25.130
it isn't just Sandler's acting,

120
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:28.370
but also his writing and storytelling choices that helped construct his

121
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.640
man-child persona take Sandler's breakthrough performance. And Billy Madison,

122
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.170
Billy spends all his time lounging in a pool and drinking himself into a stupor

123
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.500
behavior, which certainly suggest a desire to escape reality.

124
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.730
He has no job prospects to speak of and absolutely no desire to fit into

125
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:46.610
conventional society. The most pressing thing on Billy's mind.

126
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.700
<v 3>Shampoo is better. I go on first and clean their hair</v>

127
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.570
better. I leave their hair silky and smooth for this role.

128
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.820
<v 1>Sandler adopts what would become one of his trademarks,</v>

129
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.810
a high pitched and garbled voice as if a grown man were attempting to mimic a

130
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:05.644
child's voice.

131
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.170
<v 3>Ooh, that wasn't very nice. This.</v>

132
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.740
<v 1>He realizes Billy's refusal to grow up. When people criticize Billy,</v>

133
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:15.700
he immediately lashes out his face, brunching up in despair and anger,

134
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.100
like a confounded toddler about to erupt.

135
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.920
<v 3>I hate cursive and I hate all of you.</v>

136
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.720
<v 1>Like the prototypical man-child Billy also has a major inferiority complex.</v>

137
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.960
It's not a coincidence that his primary antagonist is Eric Gordon,

138
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.320
a stuck-up businessman who Lloyds his Harvard education, overbuilding.

139
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.440
<v 3>Second team, all American Harvard tree.</v>

140
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.720
<v 1>I mean people Billy can relate to on any level at all our first graders,</v>

141
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.690
once back in elementary school, he's in his element there.

142
00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:46.330
His silly jokes aren't met within different stairs, but.

143
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.760
<v 3>Laughter what do you think of that? Mr. Blue duck dad's quack cash. Dick.</v>

144
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.160
<v 1>Even Billy's romantic interest fits Von Franz is pure attorneys description</v>

145
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:57.731
teacher.

146
00:07:57.731 --> 00:08:01.570
Veronica Vaughn serves as a maternal figure to Billy helping this man-child

147
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:04.060
study and grow throughout Sandler's early films.

148
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:07.810
He consistently plays this same childlike figure of lashing out in an adult

149
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:09.520
world that doesn't know what to make of him.

150
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.380
In the first 10 minutes of Abby Gilmore,

151
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.780
happy beats up a coach who dares to mock him.

152
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.030
<v 3>Then.</v>

153
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.310
<v 1>He goes home to his girlfriend, a teacher yet again,</v>

154
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.150
and asked her to stay the night because he's had a rough day, just like Billy.

155
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:24.670
Happy wants a maternal figure to make everything better.

156
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.630
But this time the girlfriend has no interest in baby. And Sandler's man-child.

157
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.760
She calls happy a loser and leaves.

158
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.850
<v 3>I am not spending the rest of my life with a loser.</v>

159
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:34.661
<v 1>Afterwards.</v>

160
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:38.560
Happy go to the batting cage where he proceeds to let baseballs hit him directly

161
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.610
in the face and act Von Franz would undoubtedly label a dangerous sport.

162
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.260
Happy through this pain seeks to escape the reality of his failures and the only

163
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:49.150
person impressed by these immature antics.

164
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.130
You guessed it a child and Sandler's next film, the water boy.

165
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.860
He goes even playing Bobby, a juvenile man-child who still lives with his mom.

166
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.310
<v 3>Did he tell you about a little bedtime problem? Mama banking. You don't that,</v>

167
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.273
that sheet back there.

168
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.420
<v 1>Much of the comedy and the Waterboy stems from Bobby's childlike responses to</v>

169
00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:09.290
the adult world.

170
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.220
<v 3>Is there a girl you're seeing?</v>

171
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.100
I see a lot of girls again.

172
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.020
<v 1>Sandler emphasizes the characters,</v>

173
00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:22.280
childlike naivete adopting a baby is Lisbon stutter and slouching like an

174
00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:26.540
uncomfortable kid at school and like a child Bobby legitimately struggles to

175
00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:29.810
retain eye contact with anybody. However, a Sandler got older.

176
00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:34.010
His depictions of the man child began to grow take 1999 big daddy.

177
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.210
And which Sandler stars is Sony Kofax but 32 year old slacker with no job or

178
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:39.290
prospects to speak of.

179
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.430
The film opens exactly like happy Gilmore with Sonny's girlfriend breaking up

180
00:09:43.431 --> 00:09:45.290
with him because of his immature lifestyle.

181
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.150
<v 3>Why are you being so nuts to me lately?</v>

182
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.270
Because you refuse to move on to the next phase of your life.

183
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.591
<v 1>Previous films,</v>

184
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:55.580
big daddy focuses less on Sandler's immature antics and more on his maturation.

185
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.630
Sandler here issues.

186
00:09:56.631 --> 00:10:00.830
Many of his early trademark signatures like the baby voice or child is slouch.

187
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.090
Instead Sandler adopts a disaffected slacker attitude as if Sony were in a

188
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:07.340
perpetual haze, watching life passing by.

189
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.530
But after Sony takes in an abandoned child,

190
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:12.590
he's forced to grow up and become a father figure Sandler's character,

191
00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:13.910
no longer wets the bed.

192
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.450
Now he's the one who has to clean up the mess by the end of big daddy.

193
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.440
Sonny turns his life around becoming a successful lawyer with a wife and child

194
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.290
of his own. That's a pretty big departure from.

195
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.620
<v 3>I got it. And then back home.</v>

196
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.380
But this one.

197
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.390
<v 1>Just the beginning of Sandler's maturation.</v>

198
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.080
When the comedian reached his forties, he became a family man literally,

199
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.190
and on screen Sandler's films during this later period reflect his own personal

200
00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:41.720
growth as a husband and father,

201
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.440
while presenting a more nuanced outlook on the man-child Sandler's later films

202
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:47.750
typically spotlight a former mantra move.

203
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:51.230
Now in middle-age feels weighed down by domestic responsibilities to this

204
00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:54.140
Sandler character urines to return to the freedom of childhood.

205
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.960
That is he wants to become a man child. Once again,

206
00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.290
the film that best encapsulates this later Sandler period outlook,

207
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.470
none other than the offer gotten click. Yeah, that's right.

208
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.980
I said it click and click Sandler stars is Michael Newman,

209
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.980
an overworked architect exhausted by daily life.

210
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.010
When Michael gets a remote that can rewind and fast forward through time,

211
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.000
he also gets the opportunity to sidestep all adult responsibilities and

212
00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:19.670
indulgent juvenile antics. Once more in essence,

213
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.560
Michael gets to literally become a man-child one who can fart in his boss's face

214
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.590
and its consequences.

215
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.250
Michael can also skip past anything that's too emotionally challenging,

216
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.730
but by constantly fast-forwarding tasks has responsibilities.

217
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.180
Michael ultimately misses out on the most significant parts of his life,

218
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.020
neglecting his children and wife until they leave him. By the end, a tearful,

219
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.550
Michael has learned his lesson

220
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.480
Sandler's films throughout the odds consistently play out in this exact same

221
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:49.070
fashion, focusing on family,

222
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:52.910
men who yearned to return to their childhood yet who ultimately learn to embrace

223
00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:54.460
their responsibilities.

224
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.200
<v 3>Can be difficult.</v>

225
00:11:56.201 --> 00:12:01.090
Sometimes it gets bumpy with family and kids and things not

226
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.490
going exactly like you planned,

227
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.000
but that's what makes it interesting in life.

228
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.480
The first act always exciting. The second act,

229
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.540
that's where the depth comes in.

230
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.290
<v 1>Which brings us full circle to uncut gems.</v>

231
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.010
A film that shows the dark side of what happens when the man-child never quite

232
00:12:20.011 --> 00:12:20.844
grows up.

233
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.180
Sailor brilliantly takes his trademark comedic persona and applies it to a

234
00:12:24.181 --> 00:12:25.710
so-called serious film.

235
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.640
Howard has all the same basic characteristics of Sandler's previous man-child

236
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.350
rules, inferiority complex.

237
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.880
<v 4>Oscar's the wrong. I could go out and get six appraisers right now,</v>

238
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.850
five of them would say at least $3,000 a carrier.

239
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.170
<v 1>Check a need for a maternal figure to tell him everything's going to be okay.</v>

240
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.930
Even though she's at least 20 years younger than him. Oh,

241
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.320
you betcha prone to dangerous accidents.

242
00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:50.850
Sports now is just describing the whole movie.

243
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.990
Howard constantly puts his life on the line for a series of increasingly risky

244
00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:57.330
bets. I mean, all you have to do is take one.

245
00:12:57.331 --> 00:13:00.240
Look at Howard's bachelor pad to see what a man truly is.

246
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.610
It's a 15 year olds dream come true,

247
00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:06.030
complete with Nick's memorabilia and a portrait of a naked lady.

248
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.480
This has rendered all the more pathetic given that Howard's in his fifties,

249
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.810
what's more Howard, constantly neglects his familial duties.

250
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.520
His had always focused on his latest scheme.

251
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.870
Howard's wife literally has to chastise him into tucking his son into bed rather

252
00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:20.790
than watch a basketball game that he's bet on

253
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.960
in the early man-child films.

254
00:13:23.961 --> 00:13:28.170
Sandler could almost always rely on his family support, no matter his antics,

255
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.280
but in Oka gems,

256
00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:33.810
Howard is rendered all the more tragic because nobody has his back. In fact,

257
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.790
his entire family turns against him.

258
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.030
<v 5>I think you were the most annoying person I have ever met.</v>

259
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.860
I hate being with you. I hate looking at you. And if I had my way,

260
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.810
I would never see you again.

261
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.350
<v 1>Ford's daughter to stains him and at some can barely look at him after</v>

262
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:49.861
discovering.

263
00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:53.400
He has a mistress who was the girl living in your apartment and to add insult to

264
00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:57.210
injury it's Howard's own brother-in-law that's hired the goons threatening to

265
00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:00.870
kill him in a metal twist. It's almost as if Howard's family mirrors,

266
00:14:00.871 --> 00:14:02.850
the harshest critique leveled against Sandler.

267
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.420
His wife is a stand in for all the critics who instinctively find the comedian

268
00:14:06.421 --> 00:14:07.410
annoying on screen.

269
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.740
Whereas his children are a stand in for everyone who thinks Sandler's at

270
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:14.250
disappointment for wasting his talents and slumming it in juvenile comedies.

271
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.010
Unlike big daddy and click where Sandler's character,

272
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.590
see the error of their ways and eventually grow up.

273
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.040
Howard never does two thirds of the way through uncut gems.

274
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.100
He finally has a moment of clarity lamenting to his girlfriend.

275
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.900
<v 4>[Inaudible] close to do everything I do. It's not going right.</v>

276
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.130
Everything I do is not going right, but how are you?

277
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.790
<v 1>Unlike Michael or sunny never takes a moment to learn from his mistakes.</v>

278
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.481
Instead.

279
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:43.770
He doubles down on it coming up with yet another get rich quick scheme and the

280
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:46.380
results well speak for themselves.

281
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.740
Sandler's career may have started out by glorifying the man-child,

282
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.790
but as he's grown,

283
00:14:50.791 --> 00:14:53.720
his perception of the persona has apparently become far darker,

284
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.440
culminating in uncut gems with the man-child literal death.

285
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500
It's unnerving to think that all the juvenile antics, baby soda,

286
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.320
voices and poop jokes have led to well tragedy.

287
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.190
What was once labeled that dumb archetype has morphed into a Shakespearean

288
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:11.090
character flaw. Ultimately it's Howard's refusal to grow up, to change,

289
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.060
to learn, to engage with any semblance of reality.

290
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.410
That proves to be as undoing a character like Howard should be inherently

291
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.590
unlikeable yet because Sandler has grown up playing this character through his

292
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:24.680
entire career. He's able to inject Howard with the Patheos.

293
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.640
And affability only someone who knows the type like the back of his hand could,

294
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.890
this is the role that Sandler was born to play.

295
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.810
And the culmination of his man-child persona.

296
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.440
It's almost too fitting that the Safdie brothers spend years trying to give Sam

297
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.620
or to take on the role who else could have played it to such perfection.

298
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.670
So will Adam Sandler fulfill his destiny of starring in movies that aren't

299
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:47.570
terrible? Well, maybe not so fast in a recent interview,

300
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:51.170
Sandler joked that if he didn't get an Oscar nomination for uncut gems,

301
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.070
he would to quote himself and come back and do a movie again.

302
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:59.210
That is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That's how I get them.

303
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.280
Perhaps prove the man-child never quite dies after all. What do you guys think?

304
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.820
Does uncut gems, Mark peak, Adam Sandler, man childhood.

305
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.900
Where does he even go from here? Let us know what you think in the comments.

306
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.380
