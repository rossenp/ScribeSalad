<v 0>This video is brought to you by ground news.</v>

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.200
It's up wisecrack, socially distance, Jared here. Now,

3
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:12.500
if you're watching this chances are your life has recently been turned upside

4
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:17.390
down by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is currently causing mayhem all over

5
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:19.970
the globe while biologists sociologists,

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.420
all of the ologists really are going to have plenty to say about this whole

7
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:24.500
thing in the coming years,

8
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.950
it's impossible to predict the full extent of the viruses impact.

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.520
All we really know is that the world will most likely look different when this

10
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:36.140
all shakes out that's because every epidemic or pandemic in history from the

11
00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:40.820
black plague to tuberculosis to HIV has left a sizeable Mark on

12
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:43.700
humanity. Obviously there's the tragic death toll,

13
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.590
but diseases have also altered,

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.100
shaped and reshaped the course of social and political history.

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.440
Sometimes the connections are very literal.

16
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.530
Typhoid is speculated to have knocked out Alexander. The great,

17
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.820
the bubonic plague seems to fast-track the downfall of the Byzantine empire and

18
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:02.300
measles or smallpox likely did the same to the Roman empire,

19
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.410
but diseases have also kick-started everything from sexist morality laws to

20
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:07.850
public health infrastructure,

21
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:11.840
to rigorous government surveillance so much so that it's not a stretch to say

22
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.800
that diseases created the modern state. As we know it don't believe us.

23
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.020
We've got nothing but time to prove it.

24
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.710
So join us on this journey through the nasty microorganisms that have changed

25
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:25.610
human history in this wisecrack condition on how the plague created the modern

26
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:26.444
world.

27
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.130
<v 1>But first, a quick shout out to.</v>

28
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.560
<v 0>Our sponsor, ground news, not unlike diseases.</v>

29
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.170
The new cycle has definitely shaped the modern world.

30
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.160
Misinformation and hysteria can be as deadly in a pandemic as the disease

31
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.760
itself. And it's important to check the facts, health authority, guidelines,

32
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:44.420
and vetted information. Before you decide to loot stores for toilet paper,

33
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.720
between newspapers, cable coverage, and social media,

34
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.960
it's become harder and harder to make your own judgment on news stories.

35
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:51.794
These days,

36
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.130
luckily today's sponsor ground news allows you to audit the stories you read

37
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.110
online. So you can make an informed opinion.

38
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.770
The app allows you to view who has covered the same story and where they fall on

39
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:01.850
the political spectrum.

40
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.270
You can make your own judgment with less of a fear of being biased.

41
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.510
Ground news allows you to follow threads and keep track of all the coverage.

42
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.500
So you always know what is going on. The app is available on iOS or Android,

43
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:15.890
and it's free to download. It's a great tool to help you interpret your news.

44
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.560
So download it now by clicking the link in the description.

45
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.810
And now back to the show today,

46
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:23.900
we're going to focus on the bubonic plague because of the unique way it shaped

47
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:24.830
the modern world.

48
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.480
Now don't let the fun name fool you bubonic plague is a horrifically lethal

49
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:33.410
disease that mostly spreads by a flees who hang out on rats until they get the

50
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:36.110
chance to jump onto humans and chow down.

51
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.160
The plague has swept various countries and even entire continents throughout

52
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:44.720
history from ancient Byzantium to mid 19th century India to 21st century

53
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:45.590
Madagascar.

54
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.550
But we're going to focus on the second plague pandemic known as the black death,

55
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.560
which began in the mid 14th century,

56
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.170
like your dramatic roommates troubled relationship.

57
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.320
It was on again off again for approximately 500 years,

58
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.070
except it also killed up to percent of Europeans and didn't and didn't makeup

59
00:03:02.071 --> 00:03:06.480
sex on your shared couch. Naturally, the plague generated terror, panic,

60
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.390
massive violence, and a surge in religiosity.

61
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.470
People desperately fled infected cities under the prevailing wisdom of the time,

62
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.610
which held that plague and other maladies were caused by me asthma or the

63
00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:18.600
diseased air.

64
00:03:18.601 --> 00:03:23.070
And all the gnarly smells that haunted city life societies were unprepared.

65
00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:27.420
And physicians powerless in the face of an ugly as hell disease often becoming

66
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:28.440
sick themselves.

67
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.610
The Aras increased urbanization and meant more people lived in closer often

68
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.990
hygienic quarters,

69
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.400
which made it all the easier for fleas to jump from rats to humans to spread the

70
00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:42.930
disease. Also increased international trade led to many rat-infested boats,

71
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.020
transporting spices textiles. And of course,

72
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.030
bubonic plague from country to country economies were decimated social order

73
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:54.120
overthrown. The works take Naples,

74
00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:58.800
which had nearly half its population wiped out by the plague of 1656 as

75
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.040
scholar Frank Snowden writes in his book, epidemics and society.

76
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.420
Every activity of normal life ceased admits shuttered shops, unemployment,

77
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.900
hunger, Snowden depressingly notes that after a while,

78
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.390
too few people were left alive, Ariel,

79
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:15.210
the dead throughout Europe suspected sinners,

80
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.320
typically Jews and other religious dissenters forerunners accused witches and

81
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:23.010
sex workers were banished or even murdered by very scared,

82
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.600
very dumb vigilantes,

83
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.200
real and governmental systems knew they had to act fast.

84
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.970
Thus began with Snowden calls.

85
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:33.960
The first form of institutionalized public health in 15th century,

86
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:37.650
Northern Italian city States. That meant drafting plagued regulations,

87
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.150
which anointed new health magistrates who provided with full legislative

88
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:47.130
judicial and executive powers in matters related to public health by

89
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:49.170
the 16th century. In some cities,

90
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.090
these initially temporary posts had grown into permanent agencies that

91
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:55.350
is boards of health.

92
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.100
These efforts would according to Snowden Mark a vast extension,

93
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.580
an upstate power industry peers of human life that had never been subject to

94
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:03.630
political authority,

95
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.530
such extensions ranged from the regulation of butcher meat to the forest

96
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:09.750
quarantining of entire populations.

97
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.700
And this the office of health created two Lazaretto shows or not very mellow

98
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:18.030
islands were ships coming from the Eastern Mediterranean were brought to be

99
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:22.110
disembarked and fumigated again because they thought disease was spread through

100
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:25.350
bad smelling air, hundreds of less than stoked pads.

101
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.590
We're then isolated and guarded for 40 days,

102
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.820
which would become known as a quarantine after the Italian word for 40.

103
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.480
This number incidentally was chosen because in Christian scripture,

104
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.880
40 is associated with purification.

105
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.110
Moses was on Mount Sinai for 40 days before receiving the 10 commandments Christ

106
00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:44.430
was tempted for 40 days.

107
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.150
Christ stayed with his disciples for 40 days after his resurrection, et cetera.

108
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.050
So basically super solid science stuff, as dumb as this was,

109
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.010
it also happened to work because the incubation period of bubonic plague was

110
00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:57.060
shorter than 40.

111
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.430
Once the practice was found to be apparently effective in quelling the spread in

112
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:04.730
Venice, other European ports followed suit. Of course,

113
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.910
there were still the threat of plague being spread by travelers on land,

114
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.870
which vigilante groups tried to STEM by violently patrolling city walls.

115
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.560
This practice eventually became regulated with troops being deployed to form

116
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:17.420
sanitary, cordons, IE,

117
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.290
military barriers that stopped goods and people from entering and forced them

118
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.510
into adorable 40 day timeouts.

119
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.470
One coordinate in Austria was a thousand miles long required,

120
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:32.360
mandatory service of basically all male peasants and lasted 161

121
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:35.750
years as scholar Mitchell, Hammond summarizes in his book,

122
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.280
epidemics in the modern world.

123
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.850
These kinds of actions became integral to the modern notion of a functioning

124
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.390
state that assumed responsibility for the protection of borders and the

125
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:46.910
preservation of health among citizens, Hammond,

126
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.270
even argues that concerns about plague began to override concerns about

127
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:54.470
independence among Italian city States leading to widespread cooperative efforts

128
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:58.340
to STEM the disease. But of course it wasn't just enough to keep people out.

129
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.610
There was also the threat of plague spreading within a city,

130
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.100
which is where things get fascinatingly bleak.

131
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.940
Sanitary authorities took draconian measures to prevent the disease from

132
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:12.050
spreading. They hired tons of municipal officials to locate plague victims,

133
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.550
transport them to [inaudible] and bring corpses to plague burial grounds.

134
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.640
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

135
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.150
<v 0>This was an intense process picture,</v>

136
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.870
often drunk searchers and body clearers barging into ship.

137
00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:33.130
Your seriously ill roommate off to some random Island plus in Venice around two

138
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:37.210
thirds of Lazarus auto patients died. So this was for all intents and purposes,

139
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.890
a likely death sentence. And if you did survive, you'd be charged for the stay.

140
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.500
A litany of other rules, dotted various cities,

141
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.610
including forcing pet owners to kill their beloved fluffy friends who were seen

142
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:50.440
as potential sources of disease,

143
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.530
which is the single satisfact I have ever learned.

144
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.460
Other restrictions ranged from forbidding folks from selling clothes to banning

145
00:07:57.461 --> 00:07:58.840
all public gatherings.

146
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.980
Sometimes isolation methods were taken were in the house of a sick person,

147
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:06.190
was marked with a red cross. And in England wrote the phrase,

148
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.960
Lord have mercy upon us.

149
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.760
Then the sick person and their entire household were forced into confinement

150
00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:16.270
without any option for medical care and left to die.

151
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.240
So salient is the example of plague towns,

152
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:23.110
birthing modern power structures that philosopher Michel Fuko called a town

153
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:26.860
under plague and exceptional disciplinary model. In other words,

154
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.880
it was like a laboratory for the government's exercise of social control,

155
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.150
citing 17th century, French archives for co details.

156
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:36.670
The way local governments separated each plague,

157
00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:40.840
written town into districts and those districts into quarters and those quarters

158
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:44.440
into roads in a new process of segmenting public space.

159
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.860
Then there was the literal organization and segmenting of people.

160
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.630
Every person in town was required to register themselves in centralized records.

161
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.330
Then they had to go get provisions and head into which meant basically never

162
00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:58.200
leaving the house,

163
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.000
not even to walk your dog long before CCTV or the NSA

164
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.950
Fuko argues that it was here.

165
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:07.770
That government surveillance was born in each town.

166
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:11.910
A road supervisor called a syndicate would collect the keys to every house on

167
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:14.340
his block and lock the door from the outside.

168
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.450
Like a prison guard syndics would make daily row calls at each house.

169
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.310
They'd call out the name of each inhabitant,

170
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:24.270
who one by one went to the window to describe their current health condition.

171
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.230
It was best to be Frank because lying about your fever could get you the death

172
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:31.590
penalty lease chill of all breaking quarantine was,

173
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.540
and I can't stress this enough punishable by death who co notes that under

174
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:40.650
these extraordinary circumstances, inspection functions, ceaselessly,

175
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.520
the gaze is alert everywhere, stuck within the four walls.

176
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.130
If you're probably should be 17th century home,

177
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.890
every move you made was subject to supervision,

178
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.750
a tactic that was entirely unfamiliar privacy vanished under these conditions.

179
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.040
As every status update about your health went into the town's permanent records

180
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.030
as Fuko notes.

181
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.440
The plague has met fi order its function is to sort out every possible

182
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:06.150
confusion in the process,

183
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:10.050
such extreme measures make each individual subject to an omnipresent and

184
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:12.600
omniscient power. Thus, according to Fuko,

185
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.110
public health efforts ultimately were born and sustained as a means of

186
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:20.370
controlling urban space and the environment and expanded political power

187
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.840
drastically Fuko notes that some of the practices employed in plague towns could

188
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:28.050
be related to the way people with leprosy were treated when they were banished

189
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:29.130
to leper colonies.

190
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.850
The big difference though is rather than persecuting a select unfortunate few

191
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.330
fighting. The bubonic plague meant segmenting all of society,

192
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.500
which arguably resulted in a much more significant proliferation of power.

193
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.390
Creating what Fuko called the utopia of the perfect city with perfect here.

194
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:47.100
Meaning perfectly controlled.

195
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.000
Following these sorts of efforts by the 18th century,

196
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.680
plague did essentially disappear from Europe. So draconian laws worked right.

197
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.490
Well,

198
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.900
maybe Snowden notes that these policies were probably only one aspect of what

199
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:01.940
stopped the disease with other aspects,

200
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:06.620
including changes in climate hygiene and hypothetically genetic mutations.

201
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.850
However, because these laws were typically heralded as the chief cause of Europe

202
00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:13.520
salvation, they have been frequently replicated.

203
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.540
Their parents' success has in more recent pandemics resulted in governments,

204
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:21.140
behaving objectively by forcibly detaining people,

205
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.980
surveilling them and otherwise extinguishing their civil liberties. And no,

206
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:29.150
we don't mean just by closing all the IHOPs during the third plague wave at the

207
00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:30.440
end of the 19th century,

208
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:33.740
colonial Britain attempted to enforce such measures in plague Britain,

209
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:37.310
Bombay with the draconian zeal that it ignored local religious,

210
00:11:37.311 --> 00:11:39.320
cultural and medicinal practices.

211
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.100
They divided sick people from their families and burned infected houses to the

212
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:47.420
ground in what Snowden calls public health by eviction and destruction.

213
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.980
So brutal was the effort that it caused half the population to flee thus

214
00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:55.570
paradoxically spreading the disease further because again,

215
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.990
traveling fleas around the same time over in the States,

216
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.830
Chinese Americans were also ordered into quarantine with harsh laws that the

217
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:04.540
courts eventually overturned.

218
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.430
So plagues cause intense laws that when carried out badly can seriously

219
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:11.260
infringe on life and Liberty.

220
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.980
What are we supposed to make of the fact that now many of us are in complete

221
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.580
lockdown first off, just so we're clear. Stay the F home,

222
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.530
no one is burning down houses yet.

223
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.370
In which case we'd probably complain in times like these it's also worth

224
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:27.880
considering the fact that the plague didn't simply consolidate government powers

225
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:32.200
and enable abuse. They've also caused some pretty positive changes in society,

226
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.560
such as contributing to the lower-class uprising in England that eventually

227
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:39.250
ended feudalism to fostering a nationalist sentiment in India that would

228
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:42.400
eventually lead to the country's independence from colonial control.

229
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.550
What's more the plagues role in strengthening the modern state.

230
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.540
Isn't all bad either because that state gives you drinkable water paved roads

231
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.260
and is a pretty big player in the whole not dying of smallpox thing.

232
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.430
All that said it's hard to know what the effect of COVID-19 will be while

233
00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:00.730
bubonic plague is kind of the Woodstock of infectious diseases.

234
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.510
Other epidemics have also catalyzed their fair share of social change.

235
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.550
Simplest once known as the POCs created huge stigmas around sex work and laws to

236
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:14.170
ban smallpox introduced by Europeans obliterated indigenous populations in the

237
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:18.850
Americas forwarding any successful resistance to colonization a smattering of

238
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:22.420
diseases like cholera and typhoid created public health concerns that led to

239
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:25.510
widespread adaptation of indoor plumbing and urban areas.

240
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.940
And weirdly enough tuberculosis,

241
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:30.820
which spread by coughs provoked fears over hygiene,

242
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.480
leading some to speculate that tubercular bacteria could hang out in a dude's

243
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.490
beard or mustache as a result,

244
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.480
facial hair tragically disappeared from turn of the century America for a time.

245
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:45.370
At least what's ultimately so fascinating and also scary about diseases is

246
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:48.970
the unintended ways they change our perceptions of society health,

247
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.840
and even our bodies while we're plenty grateful for government run indoor

248
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:53.231
plumbing,

249
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:56.620
it's still pretty weird to realize that much of the way the state gets involved

250
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:57.760
in our day-to-day lives,

251
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.510
stems from the terror and desperation caused by infectious diseases.

252
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.860
But what do you think, why is crack?

253
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.740
Can we blame bubonic plague for all our issues with authority?

254
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.640
What legacy should we expect? COVID-19 to leave in its wake and above all.

255
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.010
When will I be allowed to leave the house again?

256
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.310
Let us know what you think in the comments, stay safe, healthy, and sane.
