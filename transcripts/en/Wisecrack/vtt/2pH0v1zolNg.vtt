00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.180
<v 1>What's up guys, Michael, here to talk about a wisecrack all time.</v>

2
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:12.110
Favorite the office we've covered the pointless grind of working at a paper

3
00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:15.680
company or the weird philosophical implications of Dwight K Schrute.

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.330
But today I'm here to talk to you about your boss and how they may or may not be

5
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:21.560
trying to convince you and,

6
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.980
or trick you into caring about your job and in doing so.

7
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:28.430
They might be a little more Michael Scott than you realize.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.020
We'll explain in this wisecrack edition on Michael Scott and spoilers ahead for

9
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:33.854
the office.

10
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.720
<v 0>At its core.</v>

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.800
<v 1>The office is a show about a workplace littered with people who kind of suck at</v>

12
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:42.350
their jobs like an accountant who can't count.

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.733
<v 0>This is a button.</v>

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.480
<v 1>Or a quality assurance rep who seems more down for crime than white collar work.</v>

15
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.080
And while folks like Oscar and Angela seem competent enough,

16
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.040
it doesn't really matter because they're working for the King of incompetence.

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.120
Michael Scott.

18
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.860
<v 0>I declare bankruptcy.</v>

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.720
Of course.

20
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.300
<v 1>The show later backtracks on that Utica.</v>

21
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.040
<v 0>Albany, all the other branches are struggling,</v>

22
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.730
but your branch is reporting strong numbers.

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.600
<v 1>Before double backtracking to show Michael's incompetence. Once again.</v>

24
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.450
<v 0>Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going.</v>

25
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.100
I just hope I find it along the way.

26
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.570
<v 1>Anyway, our useless workers are also joined by our unwilling workers.</v>

27
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.890
People who could be good at their job if they gave even these slightest iota of

28
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.940
about what they do, their Stanley who passes time, napping,

29
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.703
Halloween.

30
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.470
<v 2>He wears it. So we can sleep at his desk doing.</v>

31
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.870
<v 1>Crossword puzzles and dreaming of retirement,</v>

32
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.140
or the disgrace to Ryan who doesn't do much of anything,

33
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.290
a strategy that eventually gets him thrown into a closet, enjoy it.

34
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.670
And of course, there's Jim slacker Supreme who pulls his coworkers,

35
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.990
even the motivated ones into a spiral of unproductive antics for much of the

36
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:57.830
early seasons.

37
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.920
<v 2>He's excited about something like the office Olympics.</v>

38
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.880
He gets really into it and he does a really great job.

39
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.860
But the problem with Jim is that he works here so that hardly ever

40
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:10.694
happens.

41
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.250
<v 1>Smart. He just doesn't give a single.</v>

42
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.390
Now some of this can all be chalked up to the pains of working in a bowl job,

43
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.010
a topic we've covered before,

44
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.060
but we actually think it's really interesting because it speaks to a centuries

45
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:27.410
old problem in business, getting people to show up and do their job.

46
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.090
This might shock you.

47
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:32.540
But showing up to work every day has never been an easy sell.

48
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.700
During the long dissolution of feudalism,

49
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.720
vagrancy laws were enacted to penalize anyone who wasn't vibing with the whole

50
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.870
getting a job thing. The goal, according to sociologist,

51
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:45.860
William Chambliss was to make sure that employers had access to cheap laborers

52
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.970
who literally could not turn down a job. After the industrial revolution,

53
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.840
bosses would struggle to a culture rate their employees to workplace practices

54
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.700
like not being faced at work,

55
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:59.120
showing up on time or even just showing up at all over the years,

56
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.980
toiling away in a horrible factories would rebel against their bosses by

57
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.080
deliberately sabotaging down their work,

58
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.550
doing their work poorly and not showing up. And if those workers were organized,

59
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.630
they just playing go on strike a collective version of not showing up that

60
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:17.830
sometimes involve fun signs and sometimes involve bombs and military

61
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.730
intervention. This doesn't really sound like the modern American workplace.

62
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.550
Of course, while absenteeism remains a problem,

63
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.020
most people show up on time or like five minutes late that's because we don't

64
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.050
have some ancestral farm to return to unlike Dwight.

65
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.770
And most of us would rather show up to a job, even if we hate it,

66
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.130
if only to keep the electricity on and then Netflix streaming.

67
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.870
But the problem isn't extinct people like Jim continued to Dick around all day

68
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.640
and corporations like Dunder Mifflin,

69
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.480
continue to try to stop them from doing so whether by enacting policies against

70
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.180
wasting time, time, thief, time, thief, fire him,

71
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.580
or Ty radically monitoring workers' comp.

72
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.560
<v 3>He's not using crutches. Oh, get over the camera. Oh, worker's comp.</v>

73
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.570
<v 1>Really this whole struggle to get large groups of people to actually do their</v>

74
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:07.860
jobs persist today and is way more interesting than you think.

75
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.930
And this is Michael Scott's basic quixotic mission to get his employees to care.

76
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.280
Whether that means desperately trying to keep up morale with bizarre.

77
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.670
<v 3>Shows. Thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundee.</v>

78
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.780
<v 1>Or inventing hyper-specific characters to get people to pay attention in</v>

79
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:25.590
meetings,

80
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.430
but we can better understand the struggle like going back to the 1970s,

81
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.460
a real Renaissance period of not doing your job,

82
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.060
or at least doing it badly in the United States and Europe.

83
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.560
If today we live in a world where tons of people perform at least mediocrely at

84
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:41.340
work.

85
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.730
It's because of what happened in the aftermath of social upheaval in the late

86
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:48.930
1960s. A time when creed Bradon was still jamming with the grass roots,

87
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.920
this was when managers and the people who studied managers in the Western world,

88
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:55.680
especially France recognized a serious problem.

89
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.450
People were not showing up to work or were generally unmotivated when they did

90
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.960
that's according to sociologists, Luc Boltanski and Eve Capella,

91
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.250
who note that this coincided with an increase in strikes and even physical

92
00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:10.800
violence against bosses. What's more,

93
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.770
they noticed that the quality of work was flagging due to workers,

94
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.290
severe lack of interest in their daily tasks.

95
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.680
Obviously this kind of sucks for a company's bottom line.

96
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.650
Jim is the perfect embodiment of this kind of worker,

97
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.090
the so-called ghost loads who even deliberately sabotaged their workplaces in

98
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:29.460
order to disrupt the daily grind that they load.

99
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.290
He does this every time he pranks twice.

100
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.120
Every time he screws with Michael and every time he distracts Pam AKA all day,

101
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.870
every day.

102
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.710
So how did we go from a world where everyone was Jim in it up to one where

103
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:44.940
people check their work emails after a fun Saturday night out with a little

104
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:49.350
thing called Neo management. And even though he does a pretty bad job at it,

105
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.670
Michael Scott is the perfect embodiment of this philosophy. Michael Scott,

106
00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:57.950
as a manager is a response to everything people initially against in the late

107
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.740
sixties and seventies as well. Tans can Chappelle note,

108
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.860
nobody wanted to be a suit or sell out to the man.

109
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.790
And this image of stuffy corporate types had a lot to do with the push to make

110
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:11.840
workplaces as scientific as possible. They describe how in the 1960s,

111
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.350
there was a transition away from small nepotistic firms and family run

112
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:19.280
businesses to larger company that required professional legions of managers to

113
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.060
run properly.

114
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.010
But these larger companies also felt soulless people were not engaged with or

115
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:29.630
motivated by their work. So companies faced with this problem started to adapt.

116
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.530
And especially in the 1990s, they really started to Michael Scott it up.

117
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.400
Basically it was believed that workplace hierarchies and the resultant dominant,

118
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:39.920
dominated relations, they inspired were harmful.

119
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:43.880
And even a moral Michael seems to have internalized this message.

120
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.700
<v 3>You may look around and see two groups here,</v>

121
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.680
white collar, blue collar, but I don't see it that way. And you know, why not?

122
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.200
Because I am color blind.

123
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.180
<v 1>It's a world you might be familiar with.</v>

124
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.700
Many workplaces lost their rigid hierarchy.

125
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.240
They stripped the visible signs of power from those in charge to convince lowly

126
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:07.150
workers that their managers are just they're lovable pals.

127
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.650
<v 3>People that you work with are just when you get down to it,</v>

128
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.540
your very best friend.

129
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.550
<v 1>And this, if nothing else is the Michael Scott ethos in a nutshell,</v>

130
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.780
but taken majorly to the extreme from the very opening moments of the show is

131
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:25.480
pilot Michael's. Number one, emo has been simple.

132
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.040
Get the people in his workplace to adore him and thus adore their jobs too.

133
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.140
<v 3>Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy both.</v>

134
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.330
I want people to be afraid of how much they love it.

135
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.550
<v 1>What's actually really brilliant about the office is that by doing this,</v>

136
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:45.190
they took a real workplace phenomenon. In fact,

137
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.270
a defining phenomenon amongst this era of managers and turned it into Michael's

138
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:51.070
number one, personality flaw,

139
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.090
Michael's drive maybe a little more self-centered than just make money,

140
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.400
but the result is very much the same.

141
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.330
Your boss might slightly try to empower you with a grand vision of your

142
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:05.800
organization's noble goals or worse dress up your dull workplace with birthday

143
00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:09.310
parties, a ping pong table. And he very Jiff heavy company Slack,

144
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.720
and it might work.

145
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.920
But Michael Scott is iconic for just how plainly he shows the reality of these

146
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.120
poultry attempts at boosting worker engagement through his own incompetence.

147
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.040
He tries to buy ice cream sandwiches after everyone's healthcare was just

148
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:28.240
slashed and throws a murder mystery party to distract from bankruptcy rumors

149
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.350
across the board.

150
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.610
His attempt to spin his coworkers into family is so amazingly cringe-worthy

151
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.280
because they're so clearly not.

152
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.890
What's more as bolt-ons ski and chia pelo note,

153
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.640
the new era of managers do not seek to supervisor give orders.

154
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.810
They have understood that such roles are outmoded. They become team leaders,

155
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.590
catalysts, visionary coaches, sources of inspiration.

156
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.820
This is the description that fits Michael Scott to a T as the show is littered

157
00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:58.740
with talking heads of him aspiring to be some kind of weirdo. Thought-leader.

158
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.930
<v 3>Reverse. Psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it,</v>

159
00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:07.790
but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you

160
00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:11.960
believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid.

161
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.870
<v 1>Well, at first it seems like pure madness.</v>

162
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.690
When we understand it in the context of Neo management,

163
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.070
suddenly he makes sense he's doing what many other managers at the time were

164
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:22.910
supposed to be doing.

165
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.010
He's just taking it to the nth degree and also really sucking at it in this era.

166
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.520
According to bolt-ons kinship, Capello managers also started to stress,

167
00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:36.170
creativity to combat the whole dehumanizing meat grinder aspect of work.

168
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.660
It's a problem we can see with people who've absent,

169
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:43.160
any real creative agency and their job turned to art or the art of pranks.

170
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.810
The problem of making your job feel more creative is one even managers suffer

171
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.760
from. And we see Michael coping in a myriad of ways by recreating an episode of

172
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.950
survivor, man writing his own movie,

173
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.360
making his own commercial or dressing up like Willy Wonka for a harebrained

174
00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:03.320
promotion. Michael doesn't want his workplace to be some inhuman meat grinder,

175
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.290
which is why it pains him so much to fire anyone.

176
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.980
<v 3>Oh man. Okay. I have to fire somebody.</v>

177
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.820
<v 1>Or put a family paper company out of business. My heart says no.</v>

178
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.140
It's why he insisted his constant fun distractions are good for his workers.

179
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.500
It's also why he responds so negatively to Charles miner,

180
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.800
a manager with experience in the old school steel industry.

181
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.180
That probably doesn't value creativity as much as your new social media startup.

182
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.390
Interestingly enough, the office debuted in 2005,

183
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.140
just about a decade after these ideas were percolating. In fact,

184
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.100
to be technical,

185
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.700
Michael Scott was still in the early days of his Dunder Mifflin career,

186
00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:42.920
as the discourse really started going down.

187
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.480
And so it makes sense that he embodies the entire ethos just way to a

188
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:48.170
fault.

189
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.740
Whereas good Neo managers attempted to connect with their workers on a personal

190
00:10:51.741 --> 00:10:52.340
level.

191
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.480
Michael Scott's attempts at familiarity are constantly straining relationships,

192
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.081
driving evil,

193
00:10:57.081 --> 00:11:01.850
absolutely bananas and actively disrupting their focus from getting too involved

194
00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:05.270
in people's relationships to trying to force an employee into rehab.

195
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:08.720
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

196
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.830
<v 1>To defining the sexuality of another employee and then outing him to the whole</v>

197
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:13.664
office.

198
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.880
<v 3>Who's gay. And who's not, of course. What about Oscar? Absolutely not.</v>

199
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.683
He is.

200
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.610
<v 1>In one telling episode,</v>

201
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:27.320
we literally learn what we basically already knew that Michael's antics far from

202
00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:27.831
fostering.

203
00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:31.910
A healthy workplace are actually the single greatest cause of stress in his

204
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:32.744
employees.

205
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:38.180
<v 4>Let me just step back, please. We'll further. Okay.</v>

206
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.170
<v 1>Of course.</v>

207
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.950
As much as Michael tries to convince everyone that they're a family of equals,

208
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.620
there is still a hierarchy at the office.

209
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.110
Michael Scott is the boss still.

210
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.330
Even when he does boss stuff like making everyone attend wildly inefficient

211
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:58.690
group meetings, it's always for the greater purpose of getting closer to them.

212
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.170
But while he might spend his time pretending he's everyone's friend,

213
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.070
it takes Stanley openly define him to reveal that at the end of the day,

214
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.330
Michael is in charge. Even if, again, he's not very good at it.

215
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.400
This was a fake firing.

216
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.390
Now Neil management thinkers encountered a another growing problem in the

217
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:19.330
nineties. Workers also just didn't want creativity.

218
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.450
They wanted purpose a fat paycheck. Wasn't enough.

219
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.110
People wanted to know they were making a difference or changing the world.

220
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.341
That's why every dumb,

221
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:30.880
new social network startup will brag about connecting the world and making

222
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:32.530
people's lives better. It's a struggle.

223
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:35.530
I'm sure many of you watching this deal with, as you ask questions,

224
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:40.390
like why toil away at a job until I'm old and spiritually dead inside a

225
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:43.480
question familiar to both Pam and Jim. I said, I don't think.

226
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.610
<v 5>It's many little girl's dream to be a receptionist.</v>

227
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.360
<v 1>It's a problem. Framed at the top of the show with Jim's first talking to him.</v>

228
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.060
<v 5>My job is to speak to clients, um, on the phone about,</v>

229
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.650
uh, quantities and, uh,

230
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.560
type of copier paper.

231
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.250
<v 1>Basically Jim's job is a Orin and be pointless.</v>

232
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.720
And even after Michael has gone the way the show ends up with a happily ever

233
00:13:09.721 --> 00:13:12.060
after is to give Jim a job that is fun,

234
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.570
but able to retroactively give his time at Dunder Mifflin a purpose.

235
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.800
It was all worth it. You see,

236
00:13:16.801 --> 00:13:20.310
because Jim built a family and even married his co-worker,

237
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.100
his final talking head here, mirrors his opening.

238
00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:25.350
One only with the added purpose of love.

239
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:30.630
<v 5>My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of</v>

240
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.750
copier paper. Even if I didn't love every minute of it,

241
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.120
everything I have, I owe to this job.

242
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.650
<v 1>Heartwarming stuff,</v>

243
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.400
but it's ultimately fitting that Jim's arc is to land a job that allows him to

244
00:13:44.401 --> 00:13:47.370
be creative while the details about his new job are vague.

245
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.290
We know that he gets a job with athlete,

246
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:53.010
a sports marketing company that is allegedly more creatively fulfilling than the

247
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:56.850
paper business. He gets to play ball with his heroes, read their bad screenplay.

248
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.570
<v 5>Megan,</v>

249
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.570
I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball

250
00:14:00.571 --> 00:14:02.130
player, but I love you.

251
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.280
<v 1>And work in a place with poorly placed basketball hoops,</v>

252
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.910
AKA Neo management done, right? But back to Michael,

253
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.690
while he fails to instill creativity and purpose in the workplace,

254
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.670
the thing he's really trying to do is again in aggressively real phenomenon,

255
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.360
see all the creativity and purpose can often hide another truth.

256
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.140
Your boss can't pay you more. So how else do they get you to work harder?

257
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.240
Reading modern day management literature.

258
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:31.290
You may not be surprised to learn that things like unlimited vacation days save

259
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:33.630
companies money because you take less of them.

260
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:38.010
And perks like snacks are often valued by employees, more than cash.

261
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.790
In other words, I'd rather take a job that paid $5,000 less.

262
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.350
If I got $500 of compute, HSA and unlimited cold brew on tap. See,

263
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:47.880
as the economy changed,

264
00:14:47.881 --> 00:14:52.040
work became more competitive and opportunities to rise in ranks of your company.

265
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:53.480
Shrink significantly.

266
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.350
This loss of hierarchy meant less manager type positions to move up into and

267
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.960
companies always looking to increase their profit margin. Look,

268
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:03.020
to get more out of people for less, as a result,

269
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.980
your manager couldn't always use the motivation of a raise or a real promotion.

270
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.390
We see this very plainly when Michael gives Dwight and in name only promotion,

271
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.330
which functionally does nothing to change his job or pay rate.

272
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.270
<v 6>I am promoting you from assistant to the regional manager to assistant regional</v>

273
00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:19.870
manager.

274
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.200
<v 1>Another way managers make workers feel motivated is by assigning their</v>

275
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.890
underlings tasks that are actually managerial work to make them feel more

276
00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:27.610
valued.

277
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.880
Think of that time when Michael at Dwight picked their new healthcare plan for

278
00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:34.090
that matter, Dwight regularly takes on managerial tasks,

279
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.700
responding to Michael's lack of days with overly fervent,

280
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:40.750
supervising these strategies are all part of a larger attempt to get you to

281
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.840
emotionally engaged with your job and the people you work with,

282
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.460
but are there risks to this?

283
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:50.110
I eat what happens when your boss does have an emotional hold over you because

284
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.280
rest assured Michael in spite of his very alienating methods,

285
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.650
certainly does have that emotional hold over.

286
00:15:56.651 --> 00:16:00.010
At least some of his workers Dwight would literally kill for him.

287
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.610
And one of the shows most memorable moments is when Pam leaves Dunder Mifflin to

288
00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:06.100
follow Michael on his quest to form his own paper company.

289
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.100
This reflects a real effect of good Neo management,

290
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.070
which is that people get a new kind of investment in their job.

291
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.890
The investment of as noted Bible Todd's kinship, hello,

292
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.280
not only their technical skills, but also their creativity,

293
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.490
their sense of friendship, their emotionalism, and so on.

294
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.340
I E your full self.

295
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.600
This can though does not always result in one of your coworkers being your best,

296
00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:29.380
man.

297
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.320
<v 6>I can't believe that's what you said.</v>

298
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.540
<v 1>So what gets lost when your work life disappears into your lifeline new</v>

299
00:16:37.541 --> 00:16:39.010
risks of exploitation,

300
00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:43.210
according to our friendly management birds and that's concerning because Neal

301
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:46.270
management has been widely propagated, which is to say,

302
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.730
Michael Scott's don't happen in a vacuum.

303
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.260
And his bizarre behavior is evidence of something very real in this way.

304
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:57.220
The office actually functions as a really good case study of why your boss

305
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.130
shouldn't feel like you're family. Because when that happens,

306
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.970
it's a whole lot easier for your work to become your life. Now,

307
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.540
I'm not saying you can't like your boss and then sometimes getting the invites

308
00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:09.460
to his elaborate dinner parties. Isn't dope.

309
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:11.913
<v 6>It's disgusting.</v>

310
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.390
<v 1>And there's plenty of great bosses who will stand up for their employees and to</v>

311
00:17:19.391 --> 00:17:22.180
all the managers at Omnia media and enthusiast gaming.

312
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.290
I love you no matter what I just said, you're my family.

313
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.570
But if we look at all those other companies,

314
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.730
we can see how Neo management tactics,

315
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:34.570
whether it's playing call of duty for team-building or holding a spirited beat,

316
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.530
shad competition for promotions are almost uniformly designed to blur the

317
00:17:38.531 --> 00:17:40.120
personal professional line.

318
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.790
But the next time your boss tries to act like a family member,

319
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.630
ask yourself what he or she is really trying to do. It's possible.

320
00:17:46.631 --> 00:17:50.580
They're just trying to get more work out of you for the same amount of money,

321
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.230
but what do you guys think is the office a wholesome tale about workplace unity

322
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.250
or a secretly kind of sinister look at what happens when the boundaries between

323
00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:01.650
work and real life learn beyond recognition.
