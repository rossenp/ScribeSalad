00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>This video is brought to you by vincero watches.</v>

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.660
<v 1>What's up guys, Jared,</v>

3
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:12.590
here to talk about a movie that feels about as cheerful as living in 2020.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.050
Of course. I mean, Snowpiercer, Bonjean,

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.970
Ho's 2013 film based on a 1982 French graphic novel that might mildly haunt your

6
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:23.150
dreams unless you're really stoked about cockroach protein bars.

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.050
At first glance to film seems like a reasonable precursor to Obama's more recent

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.900
grim meditation on income inequality in parasite,

9
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.910
but when some of the snow starts to melt away,

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.390
you'll see there's so much more than meets the eye at the core of Snowpiercer

11
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.920
are two basic questions.

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.420
One is the system we live in inevitable and two, if so,

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.990
what should we do about it? And also something about ancient Roman law.

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.190
We'll get to that.

15
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.930
Welcome to this wisecrack edition on Snowpiercer and spoilers ahead for the end

16
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:52.880
of the world. But before we get into it,

17
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:56.720
I want to give a shout out to this video sponsor vincero than shero makes luxury

18
00:00:56.721 --> 00:01:00.230
watches that cost less than other premium brands. They're bold,

19
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.520
stylish and handy.

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.480
If you just want to know the time I got the chrono S in matte black,

21
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.750
and I like how it makes me feel like I can dress up any outfit just by putting

22
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:12.320
it on. I also liked that it reduces the need for me to carry my phone around.

23
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.990
That's the point of a watch, but it's underrated these days.

24
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.620
Vincero also makes bracelets and other accessories. That could be a great gift.

25
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.650
It's great for dads who are hard to shop for, and to personalize it,

26
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:26.060
you can get a customing raving. Vincero has over 20 1005 star reviews.

32
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.710
but first a quick recap meet Snowpiercer a world touring train that's.

33
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.610
After a global apocalypse became home to the last remains of humanity in the

34
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.680
most literal cast system imaginable,

35
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:58.610
rich people exist in luxury in the front of the train while poor folks exist in

36
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:02.150
squalor in the back, everyone is supposed to worship Wilford, the trains,

37
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:04.550
conductor and architect who sucks,

38
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.600
Curtis a kind of revolutionary Steve Rogers type reluctantly leads a revolt to

39
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:11.090
take control of the train spurred on by his mentor,

40
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:14.090
Gilliam a kind of more metal Nick fury Curtis,

41
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:17.990
and his Motley crew embark on a bloody journey to the front of the train along

42
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:22.670
the way they learned that the train is home to a one dope aquarium and sushi bar

43
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.500
be a somewhat disturbing nightclub and see sustainable agriculture. You know,

44
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.260
something for everyone. Finally, Curtis meets Wilford,

45
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:33.470
who explains that this whole revolution, like all the ones that proceeded,

46
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:36.230
it was planned as a means of population control.

47
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.820
<v 0>For optimum balance. However,</v>

48
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:42.230
there have been times when more radical solutions were required when the

49
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:45.230
population needed to be reduced rather

50
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.060
drastically and Gilliam was in on it too. But don't tell me,

51
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.570
you didn't know Gilliam and I, our plan.

52
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.430
<v 1>Also Wilford, who is old at this point, what's Curtis to take his place,</v>

53
00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:02.890
but I attempted Curtis spots, one too many labor laws being broken and refuses.

54
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.140
He then orders his comrade to blow the whole thing up.

55
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.090
There are two survivors the end.

56
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.870
So let's just address the Milton Friedman shaped elephant in the room.

57
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.100
This movie like a lot of bongs work is very much about capitalism.

58
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.040
A group of people is divided into the haves and have nots,

59
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.120
any resistance to this divide threatens to derail society figuratively and

60
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.420
literally, and also we're pretty sure the internships are unpaid.

61
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.343
One of Snowpiercer,

62
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.310
his primary themes is how inevitable and natural this cruel system seems.

63
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.910
It even comes complete with a whole semi religion to perpetuate belief in

64
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.530
itself.

65
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.780
<v 2>I belong to the front.</v>

66
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.860
You belong to the tail.

67
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.660
When the foot see supplies to the head,

68
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.540
the sacred line is crossed.

69
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.050
<v 1>And it's not just the social order that is treated as inescapable for that</v>

70
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:52.291
matter.

71
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:56.760
Wilfred's perpetually moving train is treated as the only source of life itself.

72
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.770
It's literally the only option.

73
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.900
<v 2>Do you ever go outside the train?</v>

74
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.320
We all die.

75
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.790
If the engine stops running, wait all die.

76
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.690
<v 1>Here. Any alternative to the status quo is literal suicide.</v>

77
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.750
While trains frequently symbolize maternity and progress.

78
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.740
This train travels on an endless loop, making any semblance of progress.

79
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.860
Illusory it's literally just going around in circles.

80
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.100
The inevitability of this trains caste system could be better understood with

81
00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:26.791
scholar Mark.

82
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:30.690
Fisher's writing on the concept of capitalist realism as Fisher rights.

83
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.320
Capitalist realism is the widespread sense that not only is capitalism,

84
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:36.930
the only viable political and economic system,

85
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.910
but also that it is now impossible.

86
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:41.520
Even to imagine a coherent alternative to it.

87
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.570
Basically it's easier to imagine the literal apocalypse than it is to imagine

88
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:48.540
the end of capitalism in the capitalist realist framework.

89
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:51.330
There's no escaping our relentless adherence to capitalism,

90
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.340
no matter how brutal the effects might be.

91
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.760
If that sounds all like Snowpiercer scholar, Jerry Canavan agrees,

92
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.170
and he wrote a whole paper about it.

93
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.290
Everything on the train exists under the guise of necessity.

94
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.960
Those in power are merely trying to protect the collective.

95
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.350
Even if that means brutally hammering a guy's arm off to prove their dumb point.

96
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.920
Of course,

97
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.730
all the talk of order and preordained roles happens a bit differently in the

98
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:13.890
real world, but the logic is the same.

99
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.480
<v 0>Everyone has their preordained position and everyone is in their place except</v>

100
00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:23.100
you. That's what people in the best place say to people in the worst place.

101
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.320
<v 1>Inequality of course is necessary for the economy to persist any tweakings of</v>

102
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:32.100
the free market will cause famine or end with gulags as Fisher puts it

103
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.850
capitalist realism, posits that any problem can be solved by the market.

104
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.690
Much as economists have long championed the simple beauty of the law of supply

105
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:41.430
and demand for distributing resources,

106
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.390
those in charge of the train to champion the power of balance and order in

107
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:46.260
feeding everyone.

108
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.750
<v 0>We must always strive for balance air water,</v>

109
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.100
food supply population.

110
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.881
<v 1>Ultimately,</v>

111
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:57.560
the beauty of this so-called balance is incredibly ironic because in order to

112
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:58.190
maintain it,

113
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.820
the wealthy must orchestrate false revolutions as a means of depopulating the

114
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:02.270
poor,

115
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.080
just as casually as they eat sushi twice a year to control the fish population.

116
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.540
<v 2>This is only served twice in a year in January and July.</v>

117
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.750
Why not enough fish? Oh,

118
00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:17.320
we know it's not the criterion balance.

119
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.700
<v 1>The system is fundamentally unbalanced and requires extensive intervention to</v>

120
00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:22.600
maintain itself.

121
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.200
Not unlike the way real-world capitalism relies on bailouts for giant

122
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:28.570
corporations and big banks. In this case though,

123
00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:31.270
it's the train that is literally too big to fail,

124
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.490
but there's more depressing ideas to be found in.

125
00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:36.490
Snowpiercer consider the way life is treated in this world.

126
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.850
74% of the poor are killed off without a second thought.

127
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.250
<v 2>Precisely 74% of you shall die.</v>

128
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.900
<v 1>Mothers have their children taken away recruited as slave labor life in the tail</v>

129
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:48.490
seems hardly worth living.

130
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.100
Here's where we get into the idea of Negro capitalism,

131
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.170
the depressing sibling of Negro power,

132
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.090
which we talked about in our mad max video,

133
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:56.890
because we apparently just love death,

134
00:06:56.891 --> 00:07:00.400
adjacent content Niekro capitalism as conceived by scholars,

135
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.720
sub abroad to Bobby banners.

136
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:05.950
G is the practices of organizational accumulation by IE gaining wealth that

137
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:08.530
involve violence, dispossession, and death.

138
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.450
In order for this system to work banners,

139
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.710
you explains governments must create certain spaces of exception or individuals

140
00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:17.980
do not possess rights, which is the tail section to a T.

141
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.090
They are subject to violent policing forbidden from free movement and deprived

142
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:23.230
of any autonomy.

143
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.190
So what happens to humans in spaces of exception to explain banners,

144
00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:28.300
you recalls philosophers,

145
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.020
Giorgio gunman's analysis with the ancient Roman legal concept of the homo

146
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.340
soccer Latin for sacred man. The homo soccer in Rome was killable,

147
00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:38.410
but not sacrificing. In other words,

148
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:41.620
they were so valueless that you could just grand theft auto them and leave

149
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:42.640
someone fatherless,

150
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.540
but you couldn't do so in a religiously meaningful kind of sacrificial murder

151
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:47.000
way.

152
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.200
The point is the homo soccer doesn't even have the benefit of being oppressed

153
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:51.610
within and by the law.

154
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.810
There's simply outside of the law banner G and a Gambon point to all kinds of

155
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:57.820
modern equivalents of people living as homo.

156
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.780
Soccer's a Gambon wrote of people in concentration camps so existed in this

157
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:04.060
extra legal health zone while banners G sites,

158
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.480
the victims of imperialism and colonization in the search for profit,

159
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.030
the lives lost due to environmental degradation,

160
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.590
unsafe working conditions or resource Wars are a kind of homo soccer in

161
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:18.280
Snowpiercer to the tail Enders exist in this strange outside of the law,

162
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:20.590
but not really position of the home of soccer.

163
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.510
Their lives are essentially meaningless,

164
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.570
except insofar as they can be useful to those who actually matter.

165
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.270

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.950
<v 1>Year, just to show that he can, because he's a canoe, banders.</v>

169
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.030
He uses these ideas to posit that aspects of our economy are literally built on

170
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:46.480
death and suffering. Whether it be a worker who dies in a mining accident,

171
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.900
a forest ecosystem that has plowed away to make room for a factory or a

172
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:54.040
mercenary soldier who kills for pay if Negro power is the politics of death,

173
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.240
Negro capitalism,

174
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.760
the economic system of death for profit to understand Snowpiercer Canavan

175
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.540
combines, Fisher's capitalist realism with banners, GS net grow capitalism,

176
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.510
taking the economics of death and projecting it into the future.

177
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:10.620
As the only viable outcome in a concept he calls Negro futurism,

178
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.580
or in his words,

179
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.120
those capitalists realist anticipations of the coming decades then anticipate

180
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.210
the future as a devastated world of death, you know,

181
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.350
like a world ruined by climate change and the definitely not idiotic idea about

182
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:24.240
how to fix it as Canavan writes,

183
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.440
Necker futurism positive future that is doomed to continue modern capitalisms

184
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.540
unsustainable and immoral practices.

185
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.740
Even as those practices become more and more destructive. And self-defeating,

186
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.850
he argues that such a vision is the dominant modern conception of the future.

187
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.440
Whereas we once imagined to cool future with jet packs and rat alien sex. Today,

188
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:48.090
we can only speculate if the 2030s will out suck it's 20th century predecessor

189
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.620
Necker futurism started blooming in the 1970s with movies like soil and green,

190
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.190
which imagines a world ravaged by environmental destruction and overpopulation

191
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.860
to posit a very gross scenario that we won't ruin for you.

192
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.310
<v 3>Soylent green is made out of.</v>

193
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.360
<v 1>The sheep, look up, which imagines in America.</v>

194
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:09.560
So toxified by capitalist tendencies that the air is not safe to breathe.

195
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.140
And Oh, you have to pay up for some clean oxygen.

196
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.710
Each story depicts capitalism as stupendously enduring,

197
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.410
even as it leads to rampant debt and destruction,

198
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.940
Negro futurism has become so ubiquitous now as to be arguably the primary form

199
00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:26.510
of futurism seen everywhere from Wally to the hunger games,

200
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:29.090
to the road to Westworld to adventure time.

201
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.200
Now Niekro futurism is certainly vividly depicted in Snowpiercer.

202
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.470
We have the post-apocalyptic world where in response to.

203
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.450
<v 3>Mankind's warming up the planet.</v>

204
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.510
<v 1>Because presumably by rampant global capitalism,</v>

205
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.130
79 countries released the artificial substance CW seven into the atmosphere,

206
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.370
which ironically freezes the world and kills most of humanity.

207
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.220
This is particularly Negro futuristic here.

208
00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:55.880
Capitalist logic has destroyed the world, not once but twice,

209
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.410
but unlike other bleak apocalypse films Snowpiercer tries to actively combat the

210
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.760
Negro futurism of our own imaginations rather than being a Negro futuristic film

211
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.500
as such, it's arguably a critique of Negro futurism as Canavan argues,

212
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.590
life aboard the train was not an inevitable reality.

213
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:17.150
Rather it was a deliberately designed atrocity machine. Someone laid the tracks,

214
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.470
someone built the train.

215
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.130
Someone is even now driving the cars and stoking the engine. A cramming,

216
00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:26.240
a bunch of people into one car to subsist on cockroach bars is inevitable.

217
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.280
It's only because someone I E Wilford deliberately wasted space on an entire car

218
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.550
of pools or another one of saunas and whatever the hell this one is.

219
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.730
If the kind of order Wilford wants is necessary,

220
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.680
it's only because he designed it to be.

221
00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:43.820
So the artificiality of the world is best demonstrated by the deliberate and

222
00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:48.050
intensive system of propaganda in necessitates, as seen in the classroom scene,

223
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.430
such propaganda and Wilford warship is imperative to maintaining this arbitrary

224
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:54.310
order. Even those more fortunate.

225
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.700
This brings us to the end of the film where Curtis has the option of inheriting

226
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.660
Wilfred's position,

227
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.350
thus maintaining order and taking on his supposedly preordained role.

228
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.730
But he doesn't.

229
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.810
Instead he sacrifices his arm to save a child and instructs his friend to blow a

230
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:11.920
hole in the train, which causes an avalanche that seems to kill almost everyone,

231
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:15.790
a board, but what's such destruction necessary. At the beginning of the film,

232
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:18.760
Curtis promises his friends that when they take over the front of the train,

233
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.750
things will be different.

234
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.990
They will rule justly and fairly will be different when we get there,

235
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.370
having seen what he seen and learned that even the Novo Gilliam is complicit in

236
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:31.300
the train's brutal architecture. He appears to no longer Harbor any such hope,

237
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.180
rather in a fitting allegory for total revolution,

238
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.750
Curtis ultimately decides that there is no better life to be had aboard this

239
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:41.770
train that the only escape is to tear it down entirely in the hopes that

240
00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:43.330
something new might spring out of it.

241
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.400
And it does two so-called train baby survive and step on the solid land

242
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:52.450
for the first time as they wander out. There are two ways we can view this one.

243
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.840
These kids are literally screwed and potentially might be eaten by that cute

244
00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:58.810
polar bear or two they're venturing out onto untouched,

245
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:01.960
snow to metaphorically construct a new world, a better,

246
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:04.360
more compassionate mode of human existence.

247
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.860
So kind of hopeful against all odds rather than merely warning about a Negro

248
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:09.790
capitalist future.

249
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.960
The film offers important lessons on orienting revolutionaries to bung appears

250
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:16.750
to more than just a little hope will have rise up against the system.

251
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:20.800
He reviles most notably the lesson that rebelling with people of different

252
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:24.550
backgrounds and from different stations in life is critical for a revolution to

253
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:25.330
succeed.

254
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.870
The members of the tail end are diverse and not all of them even speak the same

255
00:13:28.871 --> 00:13:32.770
language. Get a translator device allows Curtis to work with the higher status.

256
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.530
Nam goons was fallen due to his drug addiction.

257
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:39.130
Similar moments of solidarity come in our torch marathon to the front lines

258
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.810
where everyone, men, women,

259
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:43.900
and children provide a valuable role in the battle to the front.

260
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.800
This stands in stark contrast to bongs more recent film parasite in which

261
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:50.980
members of the working class bicker over crumbs from their benefactors.

262
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.370
Instead of working together with these different backgrounds come different

263
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:54.910
knowledge.

264
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.090
Indeed it's clear that Nam goon understands the snow is melting because of his

265
00:13:58.091 --> 00:13:59.860
past relationship with an in-unit woman.

266
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.840
<v 0>[Inaudible] like.</v>

267
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.060
<v 1>Her. He is convinced that the earth is warming.</v>

268
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.360
<v 0>New of me. [inaudible].</v>

269
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.021
<v 1>Later.</v>

270
00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:16.860
We see him preoccupied with a single snowflake and eventually deploying his snow

271
00:14:16.861 --> 00:14:19.290
knowledge to create an avalanche and derail the train.

272
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.830
It's also worth noting that this cooperation is often juxtaposed with those on

273
00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:25.410
the top, the train crew to use translators,

274
00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:28.350
but only to bark orders at the masses and in the classroom.

275
00:14:28.351 --> 00:14:30.810
A poster of native Americans has shown in the background,

276
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.080
perhaps asking us to consider what it means to treat a group of people as an

277
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.720
object of study, rather than to learn from them.

278
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.660
All of this seems quite fitting for a film by bong, Joon,

279
00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:43.650
ho who is often credited with forging the way for a new transnational form of

280
00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:45.450
film. But what do you guys think?

281
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.530
Are we being too optimistic or is there secretly hoping embedded in this at

282
00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:53.510
first totally depressing or is everything just awful forever?

283
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.880
