<v 1>The wisecrack Michael here today.</v>

00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:12.890
We're going over a topic of concern to both big tech and big Shrek.

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.900
<v 0>Do I have to do to get a little privacy?</v>

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.350
<v 1>Yes, privacy.</v>

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.550
The answer district's question is a little weld complicated in our day and age.

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.540
Do we uninstalled?

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.480
<v 0>Sorry. I just had to wash my hands before getting in.</v>

<v 1>Send a strongly worded DM to Mark Zuckerberg become a juggler to foil facial</v>

10
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.270
recognition. Privacy is all over the news. Specifically,

11
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.280
the many ways it's being trampled on.

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.900
So exactly how angry should you be if the Chinese or American governments get a

13
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:43.640
copy of your sick walk, Tik TOK,

14
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.080
we take for granted that this thing called privacy is a universal good that we

15
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.700
should share. Lots of think pieces about,

16
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.760
but what exactly is privacy in the first place?

17
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.090
Where did the idea come from and why does it raise such powerful emotions?

18
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.530
And perhaps most importantly,

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.320
why should we care about the state of privacy today?

20
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.920
Let's find out in this wisecrack condition on the philosophy of privacy,

21
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.500
but before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to this week.

22
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:10.430
Sponsor Ray con rake on earbuds are comfortable wireless earbuds that are the

23
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.710
solution for your podcast or music listening needs.

24
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.630
I prefer these over other earbuds,

25
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.440
mostly because I hate the hard shells that fall out of your ears.

26
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:20.390
So easily break out of your buds. Also a different size gel tip.

27
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.430
So you will always have a comfortable fit.

28
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.350
They come in a wide variety of colors,

29
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.240
so you can choose the pair that matches your style.

30
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.990
Rake on earbuds started about half the price of other premium wireless earbuds.

31
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:32.930
And the audio is comparable to the brand. You might know their latest model.

32
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:36.470
The everyday, each 25 is one of the best yet with six hours of playtime,

33
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.330
seamless, Bluetooth pairing, more base,

34
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:41.480
and a compact design that gives you a nice noise. Isolating fit.

40
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.520
as we know it now likely has its roots in a much more basic concept,

41
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.750
namely property,

42
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.490
the notion that certain things belong to certain people or certain groups and

43
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:08.000
not to.

44
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.290
<v 0>Others. [inaudible].</v>

45
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.860
<v 1>The philosophical discussions around ownership are some of the oldest texts we</v>

46
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:16.340
have,

47
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.490
and they lay out the separation between an individual and the group to which

48
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:22.340
that individual belongs. And without that divide,

49
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.770
talking about privacy is kind of pointless.

50
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.250
The most well-known of these treatments comes from Aristotle who posited a

51
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:31.490
division between what we call the Polis or the public sphere.

52
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:32.390
And the oil goats are.

53
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.090
<v 0>That's fair, a healthy protein.</v>

54
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.580
<v 1>Douglas McDowell points out that oil goes could have one of several different</v>

55
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.000
meanings, depending on the context, in a very literal sense.

56
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.740
It can mean an individual's house,

57
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.940
but it can also mean all of the household goods that Marie Kondo wants you to

58
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:53.990
trash I E property. And under certain circumstances, family,

59
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.590
which I don't know, do they spark joy? In other words,

60
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280
the Greek oil goes consisted. All those things,

61
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.340
which could be said to belong to the male head of the household,

62
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.910
the property itself, the commemorative Play-Doh chotchkies Oh,

63
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.270
and also the women, children, and slaves that lived on set property.

64
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.320
These things therefore did not belong to the palace. The public, of course,

65
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.610
many people didn't own land making this not a fun time.

66
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.390
Then very culturally specific distinction between the household and the public

67
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:26.020
sphere is a big part of the foundational thinking that enables us to say,

68
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.620
for instance, that data about our online behavior is ours,

69
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.220
and that it is therefore a violation of our rights to collect it without our

70
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.270
express consent.

71
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.950
We can see how by fast-forwarding from ancient Greece to colonial America there.

72
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.910
This concept of private ownership was also a big part of the reason why in

73
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.100
between teeth Colin's at the blacksmith's shop,

74
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.760
the founding fathers worked up such a collective head of steam over British

75
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:53.530
intrusion into their affairs as scholar Daniel J Solove explains revolutionary

76
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:57.970
Americans had a very specific grievance with the colonial authority at founders

77
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.850
detested, the use of general warrants and writs of assistance.

78
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.840
That is you can have your house searched and seized without any basis in

79
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:05.410
evidence.

80
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.950
And it was not uncommon for the authorities to grab the personal papers of

81
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.320
dissidence and authors underlying the founders.

82
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.070
Anger was the belief that there is such a thing as personal stuff to begin with.

83
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.790
In other words,

84
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.330
they were willing to endure the pain in the that was musket warfare.

85
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

86
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.120
<v 1>In large part to create a division between what the government does and does not</v>

87
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:28.890
have the right to inspect on demand.

88
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.030
Key American figures were even wary of surveillance by their own government so

89
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:36.720
much so that they took to writing their post-revolutionary letters in code.

90
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.600
This included folks like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, yeah.

91
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.570
<v 2>And Alexander Hamilton, they're ordering this.</v>

92
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.150
<v 1>Would lead to the third, fourth and fifth amendments.</v>

93
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.210
These prohibited the forced quartering of soldiers in a home without the owner's

94
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:48.870
consent,

95
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.960
establish the requirements of probable cause for searching and seizing your

96
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:55.320
stuff and establish the basics of a fair trial. Respectively.

97
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.740
These amendments further refine the concept of privacy with regard to

98
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.430
individuals and the relationship to a liberal democratic government and an

99
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:03.450
American context.

100
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.190
But it wasn't until 1890 that the modern idea of privacy as a legal concept was

101
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:11.010
fully articulated that year. Attorney Samuel Warren,

102
00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:12.660
and eventual Supreme court justice,

103
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:16.200
Louis Brandeis published the right to privacy in the Harvard law review.

104
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.950
It brought immediate and widespread attention to the issue of people poking

105
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:21.630
their noses and other people's business.

106
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.130
<v 2>There's two girls behind you.</v>

107
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.910
<v 1>And publishing their findings and the tabloids.</v>

108
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.810
This was a popular concern in a time when increasing population size and rapid

109
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:34.530
urbanization brought in many people into closer contact than ever with their

110
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:38.430
neighbors. And as a result, their domestic dramas in the article,

111
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:41.520
Warren and Brandeis argued that the common law conception of property

112
00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:44.070
protections ought to cover not just physical property,

113
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.200
but intangible property as well.

114
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.400
Like your sort of Netflix watch history or your idea for the next great workout.

115
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.300
<v 2>Yeah, sure. Eight minute apps. Yeah. The, uh, exercise video. Yeah. Well,</v>

116
00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:57.320
this is going to blow that right out of the water. Listen to this.

117
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.810
<v 3>Seven minute apps.</v>

118
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.210
<v 1>The way they saw it,</v>

119
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.360
the law wasn't keeping up with recent technological developments or the

120
00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:10.660
businesses that profit it off them, specifically newspapers,

121
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.110
the 19th century equivalent of TMZ, as they put it,

122
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.470
gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious,

123
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.280
but it's become a trade which has pursued with industry as well as a fronter.

124
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.020
They noted that this new trade profited off of the details of sexual relations,

125
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.500
which can only be procured by intrusion upon the domestic circle.

126
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.490
Broadly speaking,

127
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.470
privacy was then as it is now primarily about protecting your nudes in

128
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:37.180
more precise terms, legal scholar,

129
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:39.820
Dorothy Glancy claims that for Warren and Brandeis,

130
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.570
the right to privacy was the right of each individual to protect his or her

131
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:47.080
psychological integrity by exercising control over information,

132
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:51.100
which both reflected and effected that individual's personality in this way.

133
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.420
These two sepia tone men expanded the concept of the private yet again,

134
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:59.140
to include not only the property in an individual's possession and that which is

135
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:00.730
restricted from government surveillance,

136
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.140
but also what goes on inside one's head and anything that might impact that such

137
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:08.290
as potentially damaging gossip or in today's day and age,

138
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.520
your Tinder message history more recently in his 1966 study of surveillance

139
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:13.450
technology law,

140
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.860
professor Alan F Westin pointed out that laws surrounding privacy depend on

141
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:19.570
context specifically,

142
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:22.690
whether you're talking about the privacy of your average citizen versus the

143
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:25.540
privacy of the government in science, privacy, and freedom,

144
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.230
less than explains that different political systems treat privacy differently.

145
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.790
And that norms of privacy are dictated in large part by culture and tradition,

146
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.690
as he put it,

147
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.410
certain privacy patterns are functional necessities for particular kinds of

148
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:39.550
political regimes.

149
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.780
The modern totalitarian state realized to varying degrees on secrecy for the

150
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:46.930
regime and full surveillance and disclosure for all other groups.

151
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.040
In other words,

152
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:52.150
the totalitarianism scene in the Soviet union in Nazi Germany required privacy

153
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:56.200
for government pair, but the forced lack of privacy for citizens, by contrast,

154
00:07:56.201 --> 00:07:57.250
at least in theory,

155
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.760
the structure of a liberal democracy demands transparency for the government,

156
00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:03.400
coupled with privacy protections for individual citizens.

157
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.570
This statement seems perfectly obvious until you realize that even within

158
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:08.620
liberal democracies,

159
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:12.370
we've never actually reached a universal agreement about who ought to have what

160
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:16.450
kinds of privacy and for what reasons philosophers scholars, legal analyst,

161
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:20.530
and others with a vested interest have continually argued about whether privacy

162
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:24.370
is a good or bad thing to begin with in his overview of the history of privacy

163
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.590
and publicness scholar Slav coasts,

164
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.820
the call points out that private relations may also be heavily authoritarian,

165
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:34.660
violent and even brutal protection of privacy may also have negative effects

166
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.950
under the veil of privacy, abuses of power, including domination, exploitation,

167
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.050
violence, tyranny, and censorship,

168
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.650
as well as unlawful and unethical activities and families, corporations,

169
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:48.250
and organizations can be kept away from public monitoring and a righteous

170
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:52.510
sanctions to simplify privacy is great when it means keeping our browsing habits

171
00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:53.560
away from the NSA,

172
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.240
but not so great when it's as a justification for hiding child abuse in the

173
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:00.120
church, violence in the home. And so on. Even Aristotle,

174
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.720
the very thinker who helped to find the private and public spheres claimed that

175
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.780
we must not regard a citizen as belonging just to himself.

176
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.860
We must rather regard every citizen as a belonging to the state for all his talk

177
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:12.600
of private ownership. In other words,

178
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.380
Aristotle believed that the private realm extended only so far and that an

179
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.980
individual ultimately existed as part of and to serve a larger hole.

180
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.210
The later challenges to the notion of privacy as an unambiguous good came from

181
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:28.080
not only utilitarian philosopher and preserved corpse, Jeremy Bentham,

182
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.010
who called privacy,

183
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.340
one of the most mischievously efficient instruments of despotism,

184
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.060
but also feminist thinkers, such as Carol Hanisch who first coined the phrase,

185
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.930
the personal is political Panish and others challenge the idea that there is a

186
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:43.500
distinction between the public realm of tweeting hot takes and the private realm

187
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.020
of arguing with your partner about what movie to watch next.

188
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.650
They argue that the relationship between husband and wife or mother and children

189
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:53.370
are inextricably tied up with the politics of a broader society to put it

190
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.700
another way, if a society doesn't value women's agency,

191
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.920
that same idea of leads into the private home.

192
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:02.280
When a husband refuses to let his wife help decide what to watch on Netflix.

193
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.600
The inverse is also true.

194
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.750
If men refuse to let women make the hard decisions at home,

195
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:09.600
like whether to rewatch Firefly versus Battlestar Galactica,

196
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.110
they're probably less likely to trust women to vote or hold offices.

197
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.640
According to this strain of thought,

198
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.540
denying the connections between public and private life allowed outright abuse

199
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:21.810
and oppression to go unchecked, as long as they took place within the home,

200
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.940
beyond the reach of public scrutiny, of course,

201
00:10:23.941 --> 00:10:28.470
this would seemingly make a slam dunk argument for you get no privacy on your

202
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.650
phone, because as lawmakers try to chip away at things like encryption,

203
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.280
they'll inevitably point to someone doing something bad with all that privacy,

204
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:39.350
as a reason to take away way yours. In spite of these complications,

205
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.350
privacy still has its many defenders in her article.

206
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:46.610
What privacy is for law professor Julie Cohen argues that privacy is vital for

207
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:51.080
the development of individual identity or as she calls it critical subjectivity

208
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.183
as she puts it.

209
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.910
Subjectivity is a function of the interplay between emergent selfhood and social

210
00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:59.960
shaping privacy enables situated subjects to navigate within pre-existing

211
00:10:59.961 --> 00:11:01.430
cultural and social matrices,

212
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.360
creating spaces for the play in the work of self making. According to Cohen,

213
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.470
our subjectivity,

214
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:10.670
that is our sense of individual selfhood as defined both by what's going on

215
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:12.440
inside our heads and outside of them.

216
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.460
I'll a Warren and Brandeis requires privacy to fully develop in order for us to

217
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:18.470
form our own opinions, values, et cetera.

218
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.130
We require a buffer zone between what we're thinking and doing and what the

219
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.710
outside world can see. At least some of the time,

220
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.850
this space between us and everything else creates a safe area within which we

221
00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:32.900
can try out new expressions of selfhood and make mistakes that is we can do so

222
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:36.920
without fear of being mocked by the entire internet for thinking that if a Dora

223
00:11:36.921 --> 00:11:40.160
would really complete our aesthetic or being really,

224
00:11:40.161 --> 00:11:43.580
really into Twilight fanfic here, can we circle back to Western?

225
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.390
And the question of why privacy is so important in the first place,

226
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.460
you'll recall that according to westerns theory,

227
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.030
different kinds of societies need different relationships to privacy in order

228
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.020
exist. The liberal democracy re strive for, for instance,

229
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.260
requires a great deal of privacy for its individual citizens.

230
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.350
Marrying this with Cohen's understanding of the importance of privacy.

231
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.340
We could argue that democracies have to be made up of fully realized individuals

232
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:09.670
if they are to function correctly. In other words, when we lose our privacy,

233
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:13.900
we gradually lose the ability to fully develop as humans outside of the public

234
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.380
eye.

235
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.280
And that's bad for the system of government dependent on the will of the people.

236
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.810
And thanks to Warren and Brandeis,

237
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.500
we have some idea about how to maintain that crucial space for individual

238
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.900
development. Funny then that as a society,

239
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:30.250
we're giving away our privacy like candy corn on Halloween, but seriously,

240
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.510
for a group that's thrown such a massive fit about privacy invasion and data

241
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:35.920
collection. Over the last few years,

242
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.880
we seem to have very little problem in handing over our deepest secrets to

243
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:44.110
anybody offering a fun freemium game, and generally mashing that accept button.

244
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.750
Whenever we come across a terms and conditions page.

245
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.470
<v 0>Fine, you don't want to be part of this, then just sign right here.</v>

246
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.350
No, you didn't read it. This has, we don't ever have to let you out.

247
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.520
And then we can do whatever we want.

248
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.250
<v 1>Maybe that's not quite fair after all.</v>

249
00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:02.190
We're not just throwing our personal information away for nothing.

250
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.190
When we permit a government or corporation to invade our privacy,

251
00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:06.840
by handing over access to our data,

252
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:11.430
we generally believe we are getting something of value in return use of a social

253
00:13:11.431 --> 00:13:13.710
network. For instance, as Westin points out,

254
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.520
the need to socialize is a powerful one and setting our privacy as the price of

255
00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:19.860
entry can make it seem cheap by comparison.

256
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.720
He claims that each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment

257
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.270
process in which he balances the desire for privacy,

258
00:13:27.271 --> 00:13:30.840
with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others in light

259
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:34.500
of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he

260
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:37.350
lives French philosopher and mirror impersonator,

261
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:41.100
Michel Fuko even went so far as to claim that we are forced to hand over our

262
00:13:41.101 --> 00:13:43.350
privacy rights in order to participate in society,

263
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.560
which makes at least anecdotal sense, even pre-internet,

264
00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:48.900
it's understood that by stepping into the public sphere,

265
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.860
one loses any expectation of privacy as they scream at some poor trader Joe's

266
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:53.933
employee.

267
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:56.220
<v 0>Sure.</v>

268
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.590
<v 1>Get rid of your Facebook profile with a bit of effort,</v>

269
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.070
but doing so will cause a drastic increase in the number of friends,

270
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:06.120
birthdays that you miss and in immediate and marked decrease in the number of

271
00:14:06.121 --> 00:14:08.880
parties you get invited to for another example, by now,

272
00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:12.720
we're all mostly aware that rideshare and other apps may track us even when

273
00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:14.130
we're not using their services.

274
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.970
So how many of us actually went out of our way to delete those apps and call an

275
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.690
actual cab every time we want to late night ride home from the bar,

276
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.620
and that's not even touching on how easy it is to manipulate people out of their

277
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:29.040
personal information, even when they're trying to keep it safe.

278
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.970
As Carnegie Mellon researchers discovered in their review of behavioral analysis

279
00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:35.670
and experiments on people's responses to privacy invasion,

280
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.660
it is startlingly simple to con people out of their data so much.

281
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.850
So they concluded that to be effective.

282
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.480
Privacy policy should protect the naive in certain and the vulnerable.

283
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.140
It should be sufficiently flexible to evolve with the emerging unpredictable

284
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:50.760
complexities of the information.

285
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.440
So we find ourselves in a bit of a pickle on the one hand,

286
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.010
many of the technologies that make the modern world possible demand our personal

287
00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:01.970
information in exchange for access. And most of us have decided to fork it over.

288
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.110
On the other hand,

289
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.230
privacy is critical for the development of fully formed individuals.

290
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:08.420
What Julie Cohen calls situated selves,

291
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.140
who in their turn are the starting point for democracy, which most of us,

292
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:15.110
at least still claim to want, how society will deal with this.

293
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:16.790
Conundrum is still up in the air.

294
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.480
There's some resistance to our compulsive data collecting scene in the European

295
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:22.610
union's general data protection regulation,

296
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.850
which requires companies connected to disclose many of their data collection

297
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:29.360
practices. And Apple's most recent probe privacy publicity push.

298
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.700
<v 4>Or maybe it's all few titles.</v>

299
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.391
<v 1>Either way.</v>

300
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:35.660
The issue of privacy is one we'll need to keep talking about as long as we're

301
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:38.720
still interested in being people who can cover themselves.

302
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.920
What do you think wisecrack?

303
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.580
What's the state of privacy in the world today and where is the debate headed?
