<v 0>This video is brought to you by Ray cotton.</v>

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.700
Hello wise, correct. Helen here,

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:10.800
beaming to you from the comfort of my apartment.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.820
A lot of people talk about being productive during quarantine writing books,

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.270
making short films, reading all the classics, and you've done calculus,

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.250
but I have them all beat because during this time I have immersed myself in the

7
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:28.080
greatest cultural catalog of them. All. Netflix, I have studied everything.

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.860
This great purveyor of entertainment has put out, but there's one show.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.950
I was most excited to sit on my couch and kill half a day.

10
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.240
Watching space force the show seemingly had everything going for it.

11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.220
Its creator Greg Daniels had already made not one but two modern TV classics.

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.810
Plus it featured an amazing cast. Steve Morrell, John Malcovich,

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.590
Jane Lynch, Fred Willard, Lisa Kudrow, Ben Schwartz,

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.070
and Patrick Warburton paired with a ridiculous premise.

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.080
I was so hopeful and then it's just a dog

16
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.250
pile of bad press. And I don't think it was just reviewers being out of touch.

17
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.050
This show is in my very scientific end. Not at all arbitrary opinion,

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.950
bad, not exactly bright, bad, but still a colossal disappointment.

19
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.650
It left me wondering how could so many talented people produce such a misfire?

20
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.260
How did a tried and true formula go so wrong?

21
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.090
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on space force, what went wrong,

22
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.330
but before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to Ray con.

23
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.540
If you're thinking about jumping on the Bluetooth bandwagon,

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.890
now's the time to take the leap.

25
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.070
One of the greatest hesitations for me was geared bud design.

26
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.090
I don't like the hard shell earbuds because they always fall out of my ears so

27
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.840
easily.

28
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.860
But Ray on earbuds come with different sized gel tips so you can get the most

29
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:49.170
comfortable fit for your ear. They're snug,

30
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.410
compact and Brie discreet on top of a great fit.

31
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.980
They're more affordable coming in at about half the price of other premium

32
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.180
wireless brands on the market.

33
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.330
And you don't have to compromise on quality because they sound amazing.

34
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.240
Rank on earbuds are perfect from working from home,

35
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.670
working out or just doing chores around the house.

36
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:09.290
When you need to listen to music or podcasts for hours with the everyday

37
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.710
[inaudible] is their best model. Yet with six hours of playtime seamless,

38
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:18.240
Bluetooth pairing, more base and a compact design that gives you a nice noise,

39
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:23.190
isolating fit. Check them out now by going to buy rate con.com/wisecrack,

Now back to the show, first, a quick recap of the series.

43
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.060
The TV series presents a fictionalized account of the U S militaries newest

44
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:40.380
branch. The space force, as it tries to get boots on the moon by 2024,

45
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.780
Steve Carell stars as general Mark narrowed,

46
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.920
a hard nose general appointed to lead it near to constantly has to balance the

47
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:49.500
demands of his chest thumping white house superiors.

48
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.890
With those of his scientific team led by Adrian Mallory,

49
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.060
who questions if it's logically or even ethically possible to get back to the

50
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.460
moon on such a tight timeframe, making matters, even worse.

51
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.460
Nerds family life is quickly spiraling out of control.

52
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.850
His wife is in prison and his teenage daughter resents him for being a

53
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:10.420
workaholic faced with both professional and personal uncertainty.

54
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.300
There's only one place where narrowed can find relief.

55
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.070
<v 1>Go baby, don't wake up.</v>

56
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.780
Cry.

57
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.370
<v 0>Space force at its heart gives us two TV shows in one half hourish package.</v>

58
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.320
First, a wacky office sitcom.

59
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.060
I love the office and parks and rec and second a political satire in the vein of

60
00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:40.680
V but by constantly straddling this line space force doesn't quite

61
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:45.090
succeed as either. So let's break down how it fails on both counts.

62
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.920
Part one, the workplace sit-com. Since the advent of television,

63
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.970
the workplace sit-com has provided an easy to shoot setting for a group of

64
00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:58.290
eccentrics to gather round and crack wise from McHale's Navy to

65
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:01.890
taxi, to cheers, to ally McBeal, to Archer.

66
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.580
The workplace has served as a backdrop for various characters to both come

67
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:08.640
together and clash their personality differences,

68
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.710
providing conflict for each episode.

69
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.960
<v 1>Because these corporate bag Montrece home is $630 for my</v>

70
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:18.450
God forks or counts.

71
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.040
<v 0>In comedy.</v>

72
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.210
A geographic and historical guide scholar Marise Charney uses cheers as the

73
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:26.880
prototypical example of the workplace sitcom.

74
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.600
When he writes it is the most ritualized sit-com format,

75
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.950
as it relies on the repetition of a setting of each character's traits and of

76
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.110
each set of conflicts and alliances,

77
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.460
it presented a set of highly ritualized characters whose personality traits were

78
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:45.900
extremely fixed and who interacted with one another in the same ways each week,

79
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.770
each episode of cheers is structured pretty much exactly the same revolving

80
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:51.270
around bartender, Sam Malone,

81
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.000
as he tends bar and deals with patrons and employees,

82
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.360
the workplace AKA the bar became idealized,

83
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.380
not necessarily because of the job itself, but because no matter the problem,

84
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.010
each character could always rely on the people there to have their backs.

85
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.570
Sam was always willing to lend an ear to coach Diane, Carla cliff, norm,

86
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:12.120
and Frazier. Just take it from the cheers theme song.

87
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.920
<v 1>Knows your name.</v>

88
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.390
<v 0>That's true with other workplace comedies of the era and of those that proceeded</v>

89
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.520
sheers on ally McBeal. It was the law firm on taxi, the garage dispatch center.

90
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.710
However, as television age,

91
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.100
the depiction of the workplace on sitcoms became far darker.

92
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.070
Take Greg Daniel's breakout adaptation of the office.

93
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.570
The workplace became an existential prison and the shared experiences characters

94
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:44.460
bonded over when they bonded or centered around their incompetent and incredibly

95
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:49.440
offensive boss, Dunder Mifflin is a complete dead end for each character. Jim,

96
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.700
the every man hero of the series hates his job openly stating vet.

97
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.040
<v 1>Well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself.</v>

98
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v 2>In front of a train.</v>

99
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.740
<v 0>Aside from the occasional light of an office romance Dunder Mifflin is marked by</v>

100
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:05.330
soul crushing monotony.

101
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.540
<v 2>Yes, he is a run out the plot situation, just Michael.</v>

102
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.390
<v 0>In season. Two's the office Olympics.</v>

103
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.450
We see how each employee copes with their pointless jobs,

104
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.380
crafting elaborate games for themselves just to pass the time and Dunder

105
00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:22.450
Mifflin. Unlike the bar of cheers,

106
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.140
doesn't seem to bring these eccentrics together. It divides them

107
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.480
While they eventually about face later in the show,

108
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.620
much of the early seasons of the office deal with the antagonistic relationship

109
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.410
between coworkers. For instance, in season ones,

110
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:42.490
the Alliance after rumors of downsizing begin to spread people at the office

111
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.380
began to form secret packs against women.

112
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.100
<v 2>There's no downsizing, but if there were right to be protected as a system.</v>

113
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.290
<v 0>My manager later in the series,</v>

114
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.520
when the employees dare to even think about joining together and unionizing the

115
00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:58.600
Dunder Mifflin higher up squash the comradery threatening to dissolve the branch

116
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.380
completely. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch,

117
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:04.630
I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that.

118
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.050
Dunder Mifflin is repeatedly shown to be a toxic environment.

119
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.170
One in which stupidity and boringness are promoted.

120
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.810
Look no further than Jim's boss, Michael Scott,

121
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.590
who has proven time and time again, to be an impediment to productivity.

122
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.100
Michael claims to have his employee's best interest at heart guilt.

123
00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:24.100
Whenever he feels challenged, he immediately sells them out.

124
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.240
<v 2>The guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union and they have some good</v>

125
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:28.660
points.

126
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.870
<v 0>Union. If you've ever wondered why he hates Toby so much,</v>

127
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.380
it's likely because he's the only person who can challenge his antics.

128
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.890
<v 2>Miami,</v>

129
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.060
you still can't make fun of people for race or gender or sexual orientation or

130
00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:42.010
religion who let the Lemonhead.

131
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.210
<v 0>Into the room or consider the time when Jim takes a private meeting with the CFO</v>

132
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.440
and Michael mistakenly thinks this means Jim must be angling for his job to

133
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:54.370
ensure he doesn't get fired. Michael bad mounts, Jim, to his higher ups,

134
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.350
thereby sabotage Jim's promotion.

135
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.210
<v 2>Constant office distractions spends way too much time interception antagonize</v>

136
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.020
it. Other salesmen, not at all. What do you think?

137
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.090
<v 0>How bad is Dunder Mifflin? It's so bad that employment lawyer,</v>

138
00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:11.110
Julie Elgar even started a blog chronicling all the actionable offenses that

139
00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:15.790
occur at the company. And it's over 30 pages long in its later years,

140
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.190
the office softened some of these edges,

141
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.850
many characters ended up marrying their coworkers or forming unlikely

142
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.380
friendships with one another. Yet.

143
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.550
Dunder Mifflin itself always remained the destructive environment in the offices

144
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:31.150
finale. It's telling that for a vast majority of the characters,

145
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.390
their happy ending involves getting away from this corporate helmet.

146
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.240
Not quite as cheerful as well, cheers,

147
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.590
but also not quite as nightmarish as the office space forces workplace setting

148
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.680
exists somewhere between the two visions. On one hand,

149
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.280
the space force space is located in the desolate wasteland of Colorado,

150
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.630
a place where the only sign of life is a single convenience store patron by meth

151
00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:53.230
gangs.

152
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.550
It's so bad that when narrative first tells his wife where they're moving,

153
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.830
she immediately breaks down in tears,

154
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.360
Colorado like Dunder Mifflin is depicted as a dead end for narrative.

155
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:04.194
His family.

156
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.070
When the series jumps ahead a year in the opening episode near his wife is now

157
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.800
literally behind bars for unexplained reasons.

158
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.790
And his daughter has no friends or job prospects to speak of narrowed himself

159
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.713
feels trapped.

160
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.010
His momentous promotion to a four-star general is quickly undercut as he becomes

161
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:23.700
the four star general of a branch considered a joke amongst his peers.

162
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.090
<v 2>For space force. First time with your Keester in the hot seat. My peer last.</v>

163
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.360
<v 0>And yet the space force space stands in strong contrast to these immediate</v>

164
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:37.700
surroundings, hidden behind a Rocky mountain.

165
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.460
The base is a luxurious high-end campus,

166
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.960
spacious green and pristine. Heck they even have an ice cream stand.

167
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.600
So is narrowed stuck in a dead end job?

168
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.760
Or is this the opportunity of a lifetime?

169
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.790
Well space force can't really decide one way or the other.

170
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.210
Sometimes the series is very critical of narrative job and his attempts to

171
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:58.220
militarize space. After space force,

172
00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:01.940
a satellite is caught apart by a rival Chinese satellite near proposes that they

173
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:04.520
use a bomb to push the broken pieces back together.

174
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.040
<v 2>In my experience with the air force, that was very often the right answer. Very,</v>

175
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:10.874
very often.

176
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.013
<v 0>Of course,</v>

177
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.530
Mallory shoots the idea down because the phone won't work in the vacuum of

178
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:16.730
space. All right.

179
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.780
<v 2>Can bomb. That was my first instinct. Anyway, that's no better shockwaves.</v>

180
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.950
It's a vast place.

181
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.000
<v 0>Thus,</v>

182
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.470
the idea of implementing traditional military techniques is depicted not only as

183
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:30.560
wrong, but as completely absurd in the office,

184
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.520
Daniels really explored what it meant to be in a dying pointless industry,

185
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.810
a place where your average employee can only ask the basic question why,

186
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.600
and it seems like a similar opportunity with space force.

187
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.600
Whereas the office explored the waning paper industry,

188
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.600
spaceports explores the waning of American head Geminis.

189
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.040
<v 3>And Eric, if you need any help, getting back to the Chinese, what to do,</v>

190
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.660
you satellite a little ground in bound, whatever.

191
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.290
I don't know, let me know rains at your disposal.

192
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.410
<v 0>And even if the space force itself isn't obsolete,</v>

193
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.240
it certainly seems frivolous to many.

194
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.430
The show takes some strides in this direction.

195
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.260
Basically reducing the conflict between China and the U S as a childish contest,

196
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.790
mostly involving vandalism,

197
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.200
but the series pretty quickly backs off the U S actually is in a military

198
00:11:18.201 --> 00:11:21.140
standoff with the Chinese for space dominance Daniels,

199
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:23.750
even stated that the more he researched space force,

200
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.060
the more sense the department actually made.

201
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.100
The more research that we did into it,

202
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.280
the more it didn't feel like the problem was all in the heads of people in the

203
00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:32.120
United States,

204
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.720
because there's people in Russia and China and elsewhere scrambling to get up

205
00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:39.380
there. Unlike Dunder Mifflin, where the job was in and of itself,

206
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.640
completely pointless.

207
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.810
Working at the space force is treated as an integral and worthwhile vocation.

208
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.570
So the series is stuck in a strange middle ground,

209
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.480
both highly critical of the military station of space,

210
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.460
and also treating it like a necessity,

211
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.660
which makes that tire more difficult to be fair.

212
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.600
This middle ground was masterfully tread in parks and rec, uh,

213
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.090
showed that skewer, dysfunctional local politics.

214
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.010
<v 1>The slogan should be Pawnee home of crackers.</v>

215
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.380
The oranges goldfish in Indiana.

216
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.430
<v 0>Well ultimately championing local politician, Leslie, for her perseverance.</v>

217
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.700
But the viewpoint of the show unlike space force was clear.

218
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.970
The democratic process is messy, overly, bureaucratic,

219
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.890
and dominated by rich idiots,

220
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.650
but we can still try to turn a giant pit into a park.

221
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.880
It just might take a few years.

222
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.660
<v 1>We present the crown jewel of Pawnee.</v>

223
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.270
<v 0>Even more space force is missing a key ingredient that made the office parks and</v>

224
00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:37.230
rec cheers, and pretty much every sit-com ever made work,

225
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.660
the straight man or woman on cheers.

226
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.390
It was bartender Sam Malone for the office,

227
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.390
Jim Halpert for parks and rec Mark and Anne.

228
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.480
These characters served as audience surrogates for the series,

229
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.950
the every man or woman reacting to the crazy hi-jinks that happen around them on

230
00:12:52.951 --> 00:12:54.090
the office, white,

231
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.630
Michael and Angela could be as insane and off-color as needed.

232
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.810
But then you could always count on the camera panning over to Jim,

233
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.350
shaking his head in the music. However, with space force,

234
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.750
there really isn't a traditional straight man.

235
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.270
Narrowed is technically our entryway into the show.

236
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.680
The point of view character yet space force constantly distances us from him by

237
00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:15.540
depicting him as a blustering idiot.

238
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.260
It's narrowed that tries to use a monkey to fix a broken satellite and later

239
00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:23.850
accuses one of his scientists of being a Chinese spy based solely on his race.

240
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.480
<v 1>Chan Devin Ali Chan is mine. Number two,</v>

241
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:31.090
I consider him above suspicion. All right, so we've got URI Baxter.

242
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.460
<v 0>In these instances, the series cuts to Malcovich is Adrian Mallory.</v>

243
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.420
As he shakes his head and amusement. So is Mallory the every man,

244
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.350
not quite while he balances neared, he oozes pretension.

245
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.660
Mallory's even more eccentric than Baird.

246
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:50.370
A self-centered hothead set off by anyone who doesn't take him seriously without

247
00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:51.420
a straight man or woman.

248
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.440
The characters on space force constantly beer between oscillating extremes.

249
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.080
Sometimes narrowed is upheld as a beacon of virtue.

250
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.020
Someone the audience should sympathize with and relate to.

251
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.220
<v 1>Founder of the space force. That's going to be me while.</v>

252
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.830
<v 0>Other times he does this. You're overheating.</v>

253
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.303
<v 1>As weakness.</v>

254
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.350
<v 0>Ironically,</v>

255
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.490
this is a problem Greg Daniels has dealt with before on parks and rec. Sure.

256
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.130
Mark and Anne offered balanced to Leslie's antics,

257
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.790
but they weren't quite central to the show. Just take it from Daniel's himself.

258
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.580
But parks and rec didn't really hit until season two.

259
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.720
The big adjustment was that Amy Poehler was funnier being the smart center of a

260
00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:34.500
crazy world than somebody whose character flaws caused their own problems.

261
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.320
I would say by three or four episodes, we had fixed that.

262
00:14:37.321 --> 00:14:41.580
I think personally it wasn't until parks and rec created a straight woman out of

263
00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:44.820
Amy Poehler's lesbian. Nope, but the show was able to find its footing.

264
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.240
And even when she got a little too into binders and waffles,

265
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.370
she was grounded with the downtown earthiness of someone like an however space

266
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.590
for still hasn't found that balance yet.

267
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.570
But this balance is only half the story because besides being a workplace comedy

268
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.960
space force is also trying to be a political satire.

269
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.760
Part two political satire justice space force is wishy-washy about its

270
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.480
depiction of workplace antics. It's also, wishy-washy about it. Satire.

271
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.410
According to Daniel's space force is supposed to be a commentary on how the

272
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:19.430
idealism of space has been co-opted by militaristic nationalism.

273
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.580
What was once about the idealistic pursuit of human excellence?

274
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.180
<v 4>Well, I'm all for LAN</v>

275
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:30.940
purveyor.

276
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.450
<v 0>It has instead become all about national and military dominance.</v>

277
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.050
According to Daniels, I think the show's feeling is more that it's too bad.

278
00:15:38.051 --> 00:15:42.130
We're now in this new phase of space exploration where it isn't about doing it

279
00:15:42.131 --> 00:15:45.370
for all mankind, in some moments, space force,

280
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.410
really nails the satirical point.

281
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.870
<v 2>Back hard. We can bomb big bomb, little bomb, bomb, stupid bomb.</v>

282
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.100
There's one for every occasion.

283
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.630
<v 0>Yet at the same time,</v>

284
00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.490
space force constantly pulls its punches on a biting set tire like beep the show

285
00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:05.110
takes no prisoners. Every subject, every political movement is open to ridicule,

286
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.890
whether liberal or conservative, rather than attacking a political faction,

287
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.860
the show puts the entire political process on blast.

288
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.790
<v 2>The lead to think he's in here leading, but he's not.</v>

289
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.080
He is according to the room, right?

290
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.510
<v 0>Space force.</v>

291
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.770
On the other hand wants to be a satire of America's militaristic nationalism

292
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.640
without letting itself be too mean to the institution at the center of it as

293
00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:30.850
such space force lacks, any specific perspective,

294
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.470
militarizing space is both absurd and a necessity general narrative is both a

295
00:16:35.471 --> 00:16:38.230
great man and a total buffoon.

296
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:43.000
The job is both noble and a dead end space force wants to have it every which

297
00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:45.820
way. And in the process it says nothing at all.

298
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.570
Just look at how the series treats its central antagonistic relationship,

299
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.780
Mark narrative versus Adrian Mallory. In many ways,

300
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.920
this relationship is a mirror image of our favorite local government odd couple

301
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.970
in parks and rec.

302
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.320
The central antagonistic relationship was between Leslie Knope and Ron

303
00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:05.110
Swanson. Leslie represented the textbook liberal.

304
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.660
She earnestly believed that Republic service.

305
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.350
She could help fix the wrongs of the world and build a better tomorrow.

306
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.840
When we worked here together,

307
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.120
we fought scratched and clawed to make

308
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.320
people's lives a tiny bit better. That's what public service is all about.

309
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.460
However, Leslie's boss Ron represented the textbook libertarian.

310
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.220
He believed the government should be virtually nonexistent.

311
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.890
<v 2>The idea of a perfect government is one guy who sits in a small room at a</v>

312
00:17:35.891 --> 00:17:39.100
desk. And the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke.

313
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.170
<v 0>As such bond supported,</v>

314
00:17:41.171 --> 00:17:45.250
minimizing the parks and rec departments output by hiring people who would do as

315
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.120
little as possible.

316
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.780
<v 2>Like Tom, he doesn't do a lot work around here. He shows zero initiative.</v>

317
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.010
It's not a team player. He's never wanting to go that extra mile.

318
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.830
Tom is exactly what I'm looking for in a government employee.

319
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.500
<v 0>Now naturally you would expect Leslie and Ronda butt heads and yes,</v>

320
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.790
oftentimes they did.

321
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.320
<v 1>Whoop me want more pointless social programs, yummy, yummy, yummy.</v>

322
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.000
<v 0>But as the series grew,</v>

323
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.600
the show focused less on the antagonism between the two and more of their

324
00:18:14.601 --> 00:18:17.360
unlikely friendship, despite their political differences.

325
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.720
Ron and Leslie genuinely cared for one another and help each other,

326
00:18:20.721 --> 00:18:24.980
both professionally and personally as such parks and rec used Ron and Leslie's

327
00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:27.980
relationship to present an idealized form of government.

328
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.640
One in which people from opposing party lines could still come together to get

329
00:18:31.641 --> 00:18:33.560
things done. Just take it from Amy Poehler.

330
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.980
The show is about the fact that there's a lot of people who work together who

331
00:18:36.981 --> 00:18:39.770
have nothing in common, except for the fact that they worked together.

332
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.560
That really describes to me national politics,

333
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.150
people who have nothing in common,

334
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.240
except for the fact that they've worked together and have to find a way to work

335
00:18:47.241 --> 00:18:50.090
together and make change happen. Similarly,

336
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.140
on space force narrowed and Mallory represent opposite ends of the ideological

337
00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:54.974
spectrum.

338
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.060
Mallory embodies a kind of small liberal intelligence SIA or as narrowed is

339
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.190
you're ignorant and blustery military man.

340
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.850
<v 2>What used to be known in America as a man.</v>

341
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.130
<v 0>But unlike parks and rec space force,</v>

342
00:19:07.131 --> 00:19:11.120
doesn't use this contrast in relationship to comment on any larger issues.

343
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.580
Instead, it's just kind of all over the place.

344
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.570
Sometimes Mallory is used as an obstacle for Nair to overcome. For instance,

345
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.140
in the pilot, Mallory keeps trying to underhandedly postpone narrowed,

346
00:19:21.141 --> 00:19:24.920
satellite watch saving the scientific dangers of doing so prematurely.

347
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.390
But by the end of the episode,

348
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.230
narrow follows his gut and successfully launches the satellite proving Mallory's

349
00:19:30.231 --> 00:19:34.400
objections to be unfounded. However, in later episodes near its gut,

350
00:19:34.401 --> 00:19:38.540
military instincts are liability and it's Mallory's cautious reasoning that

351
00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:42.830
saves the day and episode five narratives only able to defeat the rival air

352
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:47.180
force his team in a test skirmish because of Mallory's Deus ex Machina code

353
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.560
space force seems unsure of what side it's on Mallory's intellectual realism or

354
00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:52.670
narrative jingoism.

355
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.110
It basically becomes a toss up each episode on who will be proven, right as if,

356
00:19:57.111 --> 00:20:00.830
since narrowed won the day. Last episode. Now it's Mallory's term to do so.

357
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.640
And if the ultimate point is that both men end up rubbing off on one,

358
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:07.970
another creating a new middle ground. Well spaceports,

359
00:20:07.971 --> 00:20:11.750
doesn't present that traditional arc either. Instead by the final episodes,

360
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.950
both men suddenly shift perspectives out of the blue after space force discovers

361
00:20:15.951 --> 00:20:19.490
that the Chinese have established a base on the moon it's Mallory who thinks

362
00:20:19.491 --> 00:20:22.100
they need to take a more decisive militaristic approach.

363
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:27.170
<v 1>What if your friend who runs the Navy word to move a</v>

364
00:20:27.171 --> 00:20:31.520
carrier strike group or not to carrier strike groups

365
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.100
into the South China sea, right?

366
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.850
<v 0>Snared wants to try a more diplomatic route and speak to the Chinese general.</v>

367
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.700
Sometimes it's important that cooler heads prevail.

368
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.610
Thus the character don't even attempt to come to a middle ground.

369
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.150
They simply switch ideologies based on well plucked.

370
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.650
The closest space force comes to making a clear political point happens in the

371
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:54.460
last episode after narratives ordered by his white house superiors to burn the

372
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:58.090
Chinese moon base to the ground. He enlists Mallory to help defy this order.

373
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.280
Nair then gives the following speech.

374
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.410
<v 4>How bad polio was. People stopped taking vaccines,</v>

375
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.510
forget how bad world Wars are. People start puffing out their chest.

376
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.110
The real enemy is arrogance.

377
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.310
<v 0>This seems to be the ultimate point of space force that both Mallory and</v>

378
00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:20.640
narrative arrogance often blind them to the correct course of action.

379
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.300
If only both characters and the world at large could put their egos aside,

380
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.110
then the real work could be done and get nothing in the previous nine episodes

381
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.010
shows this point to be true because it's narrative arrogance in the pilot that

382
00:21:32.011 --> 00:21:34.980
his gut knows better than science that saves the day. And it's,

383
00:21:34.981 --> 00:21:38.730
Mallory's perceived intellectual superiority that allows the space force to

384
00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:40.560
defeat the air force in their skirmish.

385
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.310
All space forces proven up to now is that narrowed and Mallory should be staunch

386
00:21:44.311 --> 00:21:46.590
in their beliefs in case they're accidentally, right?

387
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.040
Ultimately space force twist itself so much to a piece.

388
00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:54.390
Every side that it forgets to say anything interesting or really anything much

389
00:21:54.391 --> 00:21:56.880
at all. However, it's not all doom and gloom.

390
00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.780
The first seasons of the office and parks and rec were similarly fraught with

391
00:22:00.781 --> 00:22:05.550
issues before reversing course to become two of the most beloved modern sitcoms.

392
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.240
So if anyone can write this ship, especially with such a great cast,

393
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.850
it's Greg Daniels, but what do you think?

394
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.650
Are we just cranky because space force,

395
00:22:13.651 --> 00:22:17.640
has it lived up to the greatness of its predecessors or is it legitimately bad?

396
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.610
