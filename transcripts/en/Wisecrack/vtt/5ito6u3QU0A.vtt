<v 0>This video is brought to you by magic spoon.</v>

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.830
What's up wisecrack Michael here today.

3
00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:13.430
We're talking about one of our all-time favorite shows and how that show screwed

4
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:15.410
up a bit. Nothing too touchy, right?

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.400
Jay's had somebody a little out Archer quickly became one of our most beloved

6
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:20.590
shows, thanks to its quickfire.

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.440
<v 2>Banter. You know how bad that is for your eardrums. I said, do you know,</v>

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.180
drive the car, wonderfully psychotic characters.

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.373
<v 1>Shall we.</v>

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.350
<v 0>And die hard commitment to chaos and fear.</v>

11
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.200
<v 2>I only have porn just laying around.</v>

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.430
<v 0>Popularity is a bit of a double-edged sword for a TV series. Higher ratings,</v>

13
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:46.070
create more pressure for the show to run and run,

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.550
making it harder and harder for the writers to pump out top tier television that

15
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:52.060
doesn't get boring and some shows crumble under.

16
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.640
<v 1>This. Wait, you know what you need flash.</v>

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.960
<v 0>To its credit.</v>

18
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.200
Archer has been pretty fearless and its attempts to solve this problem,

19
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.360
but still something went wrong.

20
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.630
Rest assured we're not going on some anti Archer tirade.

21
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.830
We respect that the show completely overhauled itself on numerous occasions in

22
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:13.370
increasingly bold ways. But weirdly the more Archer changed,

23
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.600
the more it kind of stayed the same. And usually for the worse.

24
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.990
<v 2>Splenda, introspection is the enemy of happiness.</v>

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.070
So my advice is don't always work for me. Has it though?

26
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.350
I don't know. That's the beauty.

27
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.340
<v 0>No, really. And we'll explain why in this wisecrack edition on Archer,</v>

28
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.290
what went wrong and spoilers.

29
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.370
<v 1>For Archer ahead.</v>

30
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.290
<v 0>But before we get into it,</v>

31
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.290
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor the product that has fueled

32
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.620
today's video magic spoon cereal. When I was a kid,

33
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.340
I used to love eating cereal, but I had to give it up because as I got older,

34
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:50.930
it started to make me feel awful.

35
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.440
It tasted like pure sugar and would always leave me feeling sick.

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.290
Not exactly how you want to start your day.

37
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.490
Magic's food is a cereal for us olds that aren't yet Facebook commenters,

38
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.780
but also aren't hopping on the latest tic-tac trend. It comes in four flavors,

39
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.440
Coco, fruity, frosted, and blueberry. And with the variety pack,

40
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.180
you can try them all. It tastes amazing. And I love it. It has no sugar,

41
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.890
11 grams of protein and only three net grams of carbs in each serving it's

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.220
Now back to the show to figure what went wrong.

55
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.730
We have to figure out what went right by Adam Reed's own admission.

56
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.770
Archer is essentially a workplace comedy.

57
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.110
Even if it doesn't look like when at first glance,

58
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.630
whether they're stealing diamonds or selling cocaine,

59
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.390
the members of ISIS are always steeped in office drama.

60
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.200
There are workplaces defined by gossip, grudges and petty rivalries.

61
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.550
Also flex accounts.

62
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.370
<v 3>$630 For my God forks are</v>

63
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.750
counts.

64
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.910
<v 0>HR complaints, and who's screwing.</v>

65
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.780
<v 3>Who, and if you want to have false sloppy sex with me on Cyril's desk,</v>

66
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.880
please line up art and take a number.

67
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.760
<v 0>So just like any other workplace on TV, really,</v>

68
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:42.600
except with far more weapons training and far less impulse control.

69
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.630
<v 2>Uh, Pam, I will end you.</v>

70
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.871
<v 0>Well,</v>

71
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:49.980
there is lots of high drama going on during each episode of Archer assassination

72
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:52.740
attempts, high-profile heist and countless deaths.

73
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.060
It is all treated with exactly the same casual disregard in mild irritation with

74
00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:00.930
which your usual workplace TV characters confront conflict. As a result,

75
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.780
Archer gets to function like a typical workplace comedy.

76
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.420
Even if the workplace itself is a.

77
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.900
<v 3>Yeah, but then I wouldn't get to hang out with everybody at work.</v>

78
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.970
You hate everybody at work.

79
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.300
I know it's the only thing that gets me out of bed every morning.

80
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.980
<v 0>Common in office works well for TV because of how naturally unchanging it is,</v>

81
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.300
whether it's a traditional office like, well, the office or a failing bar,

82
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:27.660
like it's always sunny in Philadelphia or a police department like Brooklyn

83
00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:30.570
nine, nine, the setting acts as a kind of bubble.

84
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.820
Fossilizing the characters over time,

85
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.060
the same people clock in at the same time each day,

86
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.960
make the same complaints about their job and get drawn into these same arguments

87
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:42.840
and flirtations with these same colleagues, all of this.

88
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.450
<v 3>I've heard all of this before. No shepherd.</v>

89
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.790
<v 0>It makes the fictional workplace relatable.</v>

90
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.630
While also letting the show reset itself. After each episode,

91
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.910
this repetition can also highlight just how psychologically stuck characters are

92
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.661
for Sterling.

93
00:04:57.661 --> 00:05:01.620
This means drinking screwing and shooting himself into a state of emotional

94
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:02.340
numbness.

95
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.420
Every member of the team is the worst version of themselves on repeat Mallory,

96
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.780
manipulates everyone around her so that she can feel in control.

97
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.660
Cyril desperately tries to break free of his beta male image.

98
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.190
And lotta is forever caught between her revulsion and attraction to Archer.

99
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.890
Their inability to break with their own patterns,

100
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.700
both provides a constant source of comedy and makes them feel real.

101
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.710
Albeit hugely messed up. They are continually undone by the same weaknesses,

102
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.900
just like we all are. Of course,

103
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:35.040
we do see the characters managed to diverge from their well-worn paths from time

104
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:35.640
to time,

105
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.660
even if only a little Archer is willfully obtuse to the point that the vast

106
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:43.560
majority of his bad behavior never comes back to haunt him as a result.

107
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.850
He is highly resistant to learning any sort of lesson from anything.

108
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.930
<v 2>No, I don't think it's a trap, although I never do.</v>

109
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.450
And it very often is.

110
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.051
<v 0>However,</v>

111
00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:58.910
every so often we catch a glimpse of the person hiding under Sterling's tough

112
00:05:58.911 --> 00:05:59.660
facade.

113
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.750
Like when we learned about his troubled upbringing that left him emotionally

114
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:06.740
damaged and he has moments with Lana and Mallory would show that they do

115
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.830
genuinely care about each other, even if they never last them.

116
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.320
<v 3>Just like I taught you without any help from whoever your father is.</v>

117
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.070
<v 2>Yeah, you were always there for me, which I never really thank you.</v>

118
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.550
<v 0>Archer's character is also rounded out with revelations about a sphere of</v>

119
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.970
alligators or his attitude towards death. Bit by bit,

120
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.840
these little details combined with his constant willful disregard for his own

121
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:32.830
safety paint, a picture of someone who isn't just your standard cartoon sit-com,

122
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.660
but a guy who has a thoroughly and fascinatingly messed up relationship with his

123
00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:38.494
own mortality.

124
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.380
<v 3>Oh, so suddenly you don't have a death wish.</v>

125
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.600
<v 2>I've never had a death wish. It's just that.</v>

126
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:46.570
I don't believe that I personally even can die.

127
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.050
<v 0>With the employees of ISIS. It's these incremental bits of growth,</v>

128
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.620
which give them their depth and make them more than just walking punchlines

129
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.700
rather than a random zaniness. Their jokes often play off their own psychology.

130
00:06:57.701 --> 00:07:00.580
And history's pretty sure the Nazis had scientists.

131
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.820
<v 3>That's why we very lost the war.</v>

132
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.930
<v 0>This kind of joke.</v>

133
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:08.260
Laden character development is a prominent feature of other successful

134
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.100
long-running comedies. Like it's always sunny in Philadelphia. This is gay man.

135
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.380
<v 3>That's two dudes bagging each other. I don't know where.</v>

136
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.630
<v 2>I fit in as a gay man and it's starting to get.</v>

137
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.280
<v 0>But despite the changes,</v>

138
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:25.720
there is still a strong element of repetition for the whole Archer is marked

139
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:27.430
with these slow developments.

140
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.210
Pam steadily grows from the group's punching bag to one of its most formidable

141
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:31.750
agents.

142
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.890
Archer is continually forced to re-examine his relationships as new situations

143
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.770
emerge like when Lana reveals that she's pregnant.

144
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.150
<v 3>A pregnant woman.</v>

145
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.130
<v 0>Or when Pam also turns out to be like the Palae of casual sex.</v>

146
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.840
<v 3>Well, how do you think that makes me feel? I don't care, Pam.</v>

147
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.580
<v 2>Now having said that,</v>

148
00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:54.460
would you please come in this dirty toilet stall and have sex with me?

149
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.960
<v 0>First few seasons,</v>

150
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:59.530
Archer had a firm grasp on how to drive the show forward in this way,

151
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.760
keeping the core dynamics largely intact while moving the pieces around just

152
00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:07.120
enough to keep things interesting and being a cartoon,

153
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.810
it fell free to play a little fast and loose with the continuity flip-flopping

154
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:13.600
on certain changes. Ray was in and out of a wheelchair.

155
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.330
Cheryl was different kinds of crazy on different days, et cetera.

156
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:21.100
Even the introduction of the wee baby, Seamus legally, but not by a logically.

157
00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:25.300
Archer son provided the perfect way for the show to flirt with the idea of daddy

158
00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:25.990
Sterling,

159
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.990
without having to actually commit to it before giving him a child of his own.

160
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:30.100
A few seasons later.

161
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.760
<v 3>Sterling Archer, I'd like you to meet your daughter</v>

162
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.620
Aberdeen.

163
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.240
<v 0>This flirtation is pretty standard.</v>

164
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.440
The unwillingness to commit to any permanent changes often see sitcoms locked

165
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.040
in, never ending will they or won't they scenarios because these offer more

166
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:46.540
flexibility. For example,

167
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.260
if two characters actually couple up the show has to find a new,

168
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:51.580
funny direction to take them in.

169
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.590
So shows like Archer will largely flirt with consequences rather than see them

170
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:59.790
play out health scares like archers cancer battle will pop up and then quickly

171
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:00.560
go away.

172
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.120
<v 2>Okay. So remember when you had cancer, um, uh,</v>

173
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.810
vaguely.

174
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.010
<v 0>Well office romances,</v>

175
00:09:07.011 --> 00:09:11.690
like his ongoing connection to Lana tend to find themselves endlessly in limbo.

176
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.260
And here's where things can start to go wrong at a certain point,

177
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.560
no matter how great the show, this can become stale.

178
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.610
As much as we like the comforting familiarity, we eventually get bored.

179
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.060
Archer is pretty explicitly aware of this problem with characters,

180
00:09:26.061 --> 00:09:29.150
cracking meta jokes about their fear of things becoming too repetitive.

181
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.790
Most notably through the beloved phrasing Jones.

182
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.400
<v 2>Are we not saying phrasing anymore? Guys,</v>

183
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.850
we really need to talk about getting phrasing back in the rotation.

184
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.780
<v 0>While other shows have tried to fend off the sense of staleness by introducing</v>

185
00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.550
new love interest or job changes.

186
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.720
Archer went all in and decided to shift settings entirely with Archer,

187
00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:51.620
vice the show throughout the retro spy thriller template and went off on a

188
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.640
cocaine fueled.

189
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.450
<v 2>Since the government has unjustly accused us of trees in,</v>

190
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.100
we are now forced to transfer those skills from espionage to criminal activity,

191
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.800
kind of like the 18, but we sell drugs.

192
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.740
<v 0>It proved to be something of a mixed bag.</v>

193
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.990
The new setting allowed for the characters to evolve.

194
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.800
It all kinds of bizarre new directions like Pam's transformation into an

195
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.570
uncontrollable Coke theme.

196
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.430
And so from season five on Archer basically began an ongoing cycle of

197
00:10:19.431 --> 00:10:23.420
radical change and reset the crew returns to being spies for awhile and then

198
00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:27.410
gets busted by the U S government forcing them to shift gears again with the

199
00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:31.190
coma seasons though is where things start to really go wrong.

200
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.650
Archer puts its faith completely injera hopping,

201
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.100
delving into Archer's unconscious mind as a way to transplant the show to a

202
00:10:37.101 --> 00:10:39.440
different era entirely. And Hey,

203
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.900
is it all that different from the genre hopping?

204
00:10:41.901 --> 00:10:45.710
The show is already done from hard-boiled in the ward zany space adventures.

205
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.880
Each new season saw the characters re-imagined to fit their new setting on

206
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:52.280
paper. This actually seems very smart.

207
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.270
What better way to counter sitcom boredom than by making each new season is

208
00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:57.140
different as possible.

209
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.130
But what actually happens when Archer goes into a coma and the characters we

210
00:11:01.131 --> 00:11:05.750
know and love go from 1940s LA to outer space, nothing great. To be honest,

211
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.460
the coma seasons basically detach all the characters from any sort of continuity

212
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.300
because these characters are just figments of Archer's imagination who look and

213
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.230
act like his colleagues watching out each character fits into the new setup,

214
00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:20.630
provides lots of room for creativity and humor,

215
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.120
both in how they change and how they stay. The same.

216
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.730
Some characters are reimagined as monsters, animals,

217
00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:30.170
and robots while Ciro remains a nebbish dork, no matter the context,

218
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.430
but everything that happens is also essentially inconsequential because for

219
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:38.660
three seasons, we know it will all be erased. When Archer wakes up,

220
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.690
this doesn't inherently make for bad television. In fact,

221
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.370
such an approach can really work.

222
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.510
The Soprano's famously used frequent dream sequences and even a pair of comatose

223
00:11:47.511 --> 00:11:51.290
episodes and which Tony imagined himself in a completely different life,

224
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.150
much like our catatonic spy,

225
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.340
but these episodes worked because while nothing Tony saw was real,

226
00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.940
they offered us a deeper look into his psyche and to add it to our understanding

227
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:04.390
of his journey through the real world, the moral of that story, basically,

228
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.800
if you're going to set a narrative,

229
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:07.630
so that is literally inside the protagonist head,

230
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.380
you need to have something to say about what's going on in there.

231
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.220
Don't get us wrong. Archers, dreamy seasons do achieve this at times,

232
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.030
keeping certain aspects of the show in place while everything else shifts around

233
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.060
underscores some of the shows, essential truths, for example,

234
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.270
no matter the time period or circumstance, Archer finds himself,

235
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.030
irresistibly drawn to Lana. And these moments,

236
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.780
the show tells us who the characters really are by showing us the parts of

237
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:34.080
themselves. They just can't seem to get away from.

238
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.290
And at times the more out there settings even provide interesting ways to

239
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.860
develop them. Like when Cheryl has sex with a literal doomsday device.

240
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.300
<v 1>You may have some unhealthy associations with sex.</v>

241
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.350
<v 0>Yes, but again, it's Archer own psyche and not Cheryl's.</v>

242
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.740
So who cares? What's more,

243
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.820
these insights are unfortunately few and far between for the most part,

244
00:12:56.821 --> 00:13:00.570
the change of scenery just makes it easier for the show to retell all jokes,

245
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.120
resetting every character to a generic model,

246
00:13:03.121 --> 00:13:04.920
which can be jammed into the new story,

247
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.850
allows them to repackage old gags like Krieger's creepiness and cereal.

248
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:12.810
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

249
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.130
<v 0>It also sees the show tend towards a degree of [inaudible] with most of its cast</v>

250
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.270
Flender is the process in which a character becomes increasingly defined by a

251
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:25.320
single trait, like how in the Simpsons Ned Flanders went from a gentle nature.

252
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.010
Do-gooder who happened to be religious to a full-blown religious zealot.

253
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.500
<v 1>Everyone is beautiful. Yes, but Jesus said that pretty much the same thing.</v>

254
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.930
Darn it. The Bible said the devil would be attractive.

255
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.360
<v 0>Pam's years of hard won status and self-confidence are suddenly snapped back so</v>

256
00:13:42.361 --> 00:13:46.410
that you can return to being the go-to gross out punchline becoming a literal

257
00:13:46.411 --> 00:13:48.780
monster during the gangs season in space,

258
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.000
by extracting them from any larger narrative.

259
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.540
The show quickly reduces its characters to little more than a series of

260
00:13:54.541 --> 00:13:57.420
exaggerated quirks and overused catchphrases Archer.

261
00:13:57.421 --> 00:14:01.260
And all of his friends are left, basically catatonic, still alive,

262
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:05.730
but frozen in place. The truth is that rather than solving the boredom,

263
00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:10.260
which can seep in as a sit-com runs on for multiple seasons archers, wild genre,

264
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:12.960
jumping acted as a way of cheating or disguising,

265
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.540
the very problems it was trying to escape.

266
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.360
It frees the show from having to keep its characters in motion.

267
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.720
Interesting avenues like Archer's Parenthood or his attempts to be a faithful

268
00:14:21.721 --> 00:14:25.560
partner are abandoned so that the show doesn't have to figure out what the hell

269
00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:27.300
to do with him in this new context.

270
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.530
While the setting and genre might change the interior lives of the characters

271
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:35.580
remain totally static rather than solving the problem of sitcom stasis.

272
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.180
The coma seasons basically just dress it up in a different costume and hope the

273
00:14:39.181 --> 00:14:42.120
viewer won't notice that nothing has actually changed,

274
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.260
but rest assured it's not all doom and gloom from the series somewhat

275
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:50.130
counter-intuitively. The show has managed to fight this DCIS by well,

276
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.910
taking a gigantically back to out.

277
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:57.650
Things used to be what happens is season 11 sees Archer awake from his

278
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:00.620
coma and ready to resume his role at ISIS. The spy agency,

279
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:02.210
which is somehow back in operation,

280
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.320
working out of the same old building with the same old staff as if nothing ever

281
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:10.730
happened almost as if miraculously saving us from the minor failures of the

282
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:11.990
previous three seasons,

283
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.170
this kind of hard reset might seem like an admission of defeat.

284
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.220
Like the band who realizes none of it's new material is working so agrees to

285
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:20.480
just play the hits from now on,

286
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.200
but it's already done a much better job at keeping the show fresh than the coma

287
00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:27.830
seasons ever did while the surface details are the same as early seasons,

288
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.910
the deeper layers are vitally different Archer is forced to reintegrate himself

289
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:35.540
into a team that no longer really needs them. Cyril is now a super spine.

290
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.160
Lana is married and the whole agency is vastly more ethical, efficient,

291
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:42.830
and cost effective than it ever was when he was there.

292
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.260
I'm just going by the book and Archer,

293
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.760
a man pathologically in need of attention has to learn to live in a world that

294
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:53.300
he's not the center of. Even his favorite group. Jokes have gone out of fashion.

295
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:58.210
<v 1>Whoa, sploosh, right? Oh yeah, we don't do that anymore.</v>

296
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.190
You know what sploosh you have to sploosh you all sploosh.

297
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.100
Everybody's blue sheds. I do not speak.

298
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.890
<v 0>These shifts in power dynamics create changes,</v>

299
00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:12.580
which are actually far more meaningful than any of the alternate setting seasons

300
00:16:12.581 --> 00:16:16.360
could yield. And as a result, we see new sides to each character.

301
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.250
Cyril is an obsessively sculpted,

302
00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:21.490
massive muscle built on a foundation of raging insecurity.

303
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.070
<v 1>Jeezy Petes that keeps happening. The dangers of increased muscle mass, I guess.</v>

304
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.670
<v 0>Lotta has achieved this sort of peace companionship and professionalism in her</v>

305
00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:32.530
life that she always thought she wanted.

306
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.670
Pam who began as the hapless HRF has become a self-assured competent,

307
00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:38.350
emotionally aware member of the team.

308
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.080
<v 1>It's been three years numb, nuts.</v>

309
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.090
We've had a whole thing going without you can't you just make an effort to fit

310
00:16:46.091 --> 00:16:46.930
yourself in.

311
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.040
<v 0>On that.</v>

312
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.390
The show even manages to transform the ongoing anxiety about backsliding from

313
00:16:52.391 --> 00:16:57.010
problem into a major theme. We must keep moving forward a Mediterranean,

314
00:16:57.011 --> 00:17:00.370
which allows it to effectively self-analyze without disappearing up its own

315
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.650
completely. But what do you think wisecrack?

316
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.190
Did you enjoy the creative freedom that the comatose seasons provided or would

317
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:10.300
you rather see Archer keep his eyes open from now on let us know what you think

318
00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:11.500
in the comments. Big.
