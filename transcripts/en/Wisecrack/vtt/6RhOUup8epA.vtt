00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.100
<v 0>This video is brought to you by war thunder.</v>

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.430
<v 1>What's up wisecrack Jared here. I'm not sure if you've noticed a trend lately,</v>

3
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:13.970
but a lot of very smart people are acting incredibly dumb.

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.170
Elon Musk made some very bold and very wrong statements about Corona virus.

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.951
Musical genius.

6
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:22.280
Kanye West has announced a run for president without even filing the right

7
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:22.970
paperwork.

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.050
And I can't seem to go a day without finding out some award-winning scientists

9
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:28.700
Hawking weird pseudoscience.

10
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.300
<v 0>Professor Milton is first of all, a medical doctor,</v>

11
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.980
a pragmatist he's convinced that water memory opens a new area of

12
00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:38.120
research for medicine.

13
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.400
<v 1>The hate on Musk or Kanye one is in my humble opinion, a musical genius,</v>

14
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.950
and the other changed the landscape of cars with Tesla.

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.500
But what if some of the weirder antics of people like Musk,

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.120
aren't just regular human error,

17
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.540
but speak to a bigger problem about how we understand intelligence.

18
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.600
In other words, why do geniuses act so dumb?

19
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.580
Welcome this wisecrack addition on the myth of genius and no spoilers ahead,

20
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.190
but before we continue, I want to give a shout out to this week.

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.630
Sponsor war thunder from the makers of cross-out and star conflict comes war

22
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:13.340
thunder, a free large-scale combat MMO. That's available on PCPs four,

23
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.350
and X-Box one in the game.

24
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.160
You can fight in history's most iconic battles by air, land, or sea.

25
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.080
Take your TA on a world tour and shoot down some helicopters or send a massive

26
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:27.560
cruiser to the bottom of the sea. With war fenders, high-end graphics.

27
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:29.690
It's like being in the middle of history.

28
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.240
There are more than 1500 combat vehicles and over 350 unique airplanes to

29
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:38.330
choose from the flight. Sam is one of my favorite parts.

30
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.420
Since they spare no detail in what it's like to fly a plane,

31
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.830
you can customize your vehicles with upgrades, mods, and even custom skins.

32
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.490
Then once you're ready, you can choose a battle from world war II, the cold war,

33
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.860
or a modern conflict anywhere on the globe.

34
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.170
War thunder is always updating the game.

35
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:56.150

So download the game today,

40
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.760
and now back to the show to really understand the strange paradox of genius.

41
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.330
I want to tell you the story of Linus Pauling board at the beginning of the 20th

42
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:17.930
century, Linus Pauling was a Titan of science in his thirties.

43
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:22.400
He proposed a third way. Adams could bind together called orbital hybridization.

44
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.760
He then went on to identify several key features of DNA structure,

45
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.480
created a formula to measure electronegativity and discovered the underlying

46
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:32.570
mechanism behind sickle cell anemia for all his work.

47
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.680
Pauling has the distinction of being only one of four people in history to win

48
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:39.470
two Nobel prizes though. One was a peace prize.

49
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.610
So if anyone gets the genius title it's Pauling, right? Well,

50
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.600
maybe not. Palling made another contribution to science, ortho,

51
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.540
molecular medicine, going to by Pauling in the late sixties,

52
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.140
the term refers to the practice of treating everything from the common cold to

53
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:55.670
psychosis, to cancer,

54
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.670
to even AIDS with vitamins taken at high mega doses.

55
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.850
Now, I don't think it takes a genius to know that vitamins won't cure cancer,

56
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.990
but at the time this idea gained some major traction after all one of the

57
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.230
smartest scientists alive was not only advocating for it,

58
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.360
but even publishing multiple books about it,

59
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.110
but the wider scientific and medical community wasn't buying it.

60
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.660
The American psychiatric association, for example,

61
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.480
wrote a blistering report in 1973,

62
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.880
questioning why Pauling's vitamin of choice.

63
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.230
Niacin seemed to never provide the results he claimed when experiments were

64
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:31.300
performed by independent investigators.

65
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.010
The APH major concern was that his claims were at best unprovable and at worst

66
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.993
dangerous,

67
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.840
despite them calling the practice and its claims deplorable and the American

68
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.150
Academy of pediatrics calling it a cult,

69
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.130
Linus Pauling only doubled down until he died in 1994 after his death in

70
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:52.600
1996 study on the effects of vitamin a and beta carotene on heavy smokers had to

71
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:57.370
be cut short after lung cancer rates soared 28% and the mortality rate Rose a

72
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.860
horrifying 17% among the participants.

73
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.610
All of which raises the very simple question,

74
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.320
how did one of the world's smartest men end up being so dumb and why do we

75
00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:09.660
continue to worship him? In spite of this,

76
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.500
even catapulting his pseudoscience to the New York times bestseller list,

77
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.280
as it turns out, the idea of genius is modern concept.

78
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.060
The Latin word genius originally referred to an individual spirit that inhabits

79
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.690
and protects a person from their birth thereby determining their character,

80
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.560
which isn't that surprising when you consider the Latin root of genius is Gignac

81
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.420
or to Perth or beget.

82
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.380
So when you grew up to be a tough as nails general or a talented Bard ancient

83
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:37.290
Romans would chalk up your talents to your individual genius.

84
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.850
And there's a certain appeal to this.

85
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.050
This Roman sense of the word can explain why someone excels in a certain area

86
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.810
without committing us to believe they're great at everything.

87
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.070
Using the sense of the word.

88
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:49.800
We can immediately see the problem with Linus Pauling.

89
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.430
The guy was a brilliant chemist and a biologist looking at the proteins of

90
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:57.420
misshapen blood cells, but not exactly a shoe in for cancer doctor of the year.

91
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.050
It wasn't until the 16 hundreds that our modern notion of genius started to

92
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:01.560
emerge.

93
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.580
The word began to refer to a specific individual with a natural intelligence or

94
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:10.140
talent and exalted natural mental ability. And this is where the problem starts,

95
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.860
where genius begins to gain the revered catch all status. It has today,

96
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.670
who words evolving definition corresponds with the larger cultural shift of the

97
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:18.780
European enlightenment.

98
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.590
This was a time of unparalleled intellectual growth in Western Europe,

99
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.710
manifesting everything from the birth of modern science to the creation of

100
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:27.090
calculus, astronomy,

101
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:30.360
and economics central to all this intellectual progress though,

102
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.700
was the idea that man could through his intellect,

103
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.180
unlock the keys to the universe and change our world for the better.

104
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.020
This is around when we start to see glimmers of our modern day genius, warship,

105
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.890
18th century, French philosopher, and Roberto Dr. Go for example,

106
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.030
asserted that progress only occurs when an individual genius makes advances in

107
00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:50.310
their field. According to [inaudible] state tab,

108
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:54.240
the responsibility to foster these geniuses and allow them to flourish in his

109
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:54.571
eyes.

110
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:58.730
There probably wouldn't be anything wrong with government Tesla or solar city

111
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:02.150
through lucrative tax credits or giving Conway's fashion brand Yeezy,

112
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.350
a small business loan in the wake of COVID-19 it's all in the service of further

113
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:10.430
developing their genius, 19th century, Scottish philosopher and mathematician.

114
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.310
Thomas Carlisle takes this idea of war shipping geniuses.

115
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.770
One step further in his book on heroes,

116
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:19.610
hero worship and the heroic and history Carlisle famously stated that the

117
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:23.870
history of the world is, but the biography of great men in Carlyle's view,

118
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:27.770
a select few geniuses were responsible for all the major developments throughout

119
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:31.820
history. While us lay people were just along for the ride. After all history,

120
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.480
won't remember the original founders of Tesla, engineers, Martin Eberhard,

121
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:39.320
and Mark tarponing much less credit the countless other designers or technicians

122
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:43.400
who have worked towards the company success, but we won't forget Elon Musk,

123
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.050
American philosopher, Sidney hook,

124
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.570
perhaps the best encapsulates this perspective,

125
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.960
arguing that genius is not the result of compounding talent.

126
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.510
How many battalions are the equivalent of a Napoleon?

127
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.790
How many minor poets will give us the Shakespeare?

128
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.730
How many run of the mill scientists will do the work of an Einstein,

129
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.680
but even though they lauded geniuses,

130
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:04.550
they still distinguish between different kinds of geniuses. Thomas Carlisle,

131
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:08.270
for example, divided it as great men into six categories. He wouldn't,

132
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:08.931
for example,

133
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:12.950
compared the genius of a priest like Martin Luther to that of a poet like John

134
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:13.460
Milton,

135
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.840
similarly Francis Galton the father of the sense extremely debunked theory of

136
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:21.680
eugenics broke down. These star-studded world of geniuses into categories,

137
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.160
ranging from judges and statesman to scientists, painters, poets,

138
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.830
and even oarsmen now golden and Carlisle.

139
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:31.400
Aren't exactly the standard for today's scientific exploration of genius.

140
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.370
But if you want to look at the world of smart people saying dumb things,

141
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.850
a pretty good red flag is people venturing outside of their speciality.

142
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.420
That isn't to say that multi-platinum artist Kanye West isn't allowed to have

143
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:44.930
political opinions or that scientists haven't excelled in multiple fields,

144
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.420
but in today's world of hyper specialized knowledge,

145
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.480
nothing about understanding how jet propulsion works makes one,

146
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.100
an expert on epidemiology.

147
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.000
Nowhere is this more apparent than when you venture into the world of

148
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.230
pseudo-science there you'll see a crop of PhDs and MDs venturing outside of

149
00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:02.260
their speciality claiming to be some revolutionary thinker,

150
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.400
despite their lack of training or peer reviewed publications on the topic. Take,

151
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:07.031
for example,

152
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:10.990
someone like [inaudible] who despite being awarded a Nobel prize for proving

153
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:15.010
electron tunneling occurs in super doctors also happens to be among the biggest

154
00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:18.310
climate change deniers in the scientific community. On the one hand,

155
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.930
a genius on the other, the dumdum there's also just people who go off the rails,

156
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.280
take Luke Monterey,

157
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.300
who proved that a retrovirus causes AIDS only to turn around and publish two

158
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:33.130
papers claiming that DNA can produce electromagnetic signals when diluted AKA

159
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.240
basically homeopathy Monte AEs claims were met with scorn from the scientific

160
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:39.520
community, but this is only half the story.

161
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.500
There's another reason modern society,

162
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:44.770
valorizes geniuses like Albert Einstein or Elon Musk,

163
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.700
presuming them to somehow have special brain's capable of tackling any problem

164
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:49.600
regardless of the time,

165
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.950
which brings us to IQ cast your mind back to the French countryside in the early

166
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:57.210
20th century, universal education has just become a thing.

167
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.900
And as your classroom is flooded with children from all sorts of backgrounds,

168
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.200
you need to identify which ones have special education needs so they can get

169
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:07.500
extra attention. How do you do this? Well, if your psychologist,

170
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.900
Alfred Benet and his assistant Theodore Simon,

171
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.700
you decide to test each child to determine what their mental age is a child who

172
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.700
could answer all the questions expected of a typical eight year old would be

173
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:19.590
said to have the mental age of eight.

174
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.380
But if the next eight year old could answer the questions for a typical

175
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:24.690
nine-year-old, they'd have a mental age of nine.

176
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.510
Now it's important to note that Benet didn't think this number could fully

177
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:31.440
quantify a child's intellectual capacity or potential weirdly that it could

178
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:34.710
predict how a child would perform in school at that point in time,

179
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.730
just because a young Linus Pauling guilty chemistry lab from scratch and likely

180
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:42.630
had a higher mental age than his peers wouldn't in Bearnaise mind mean that the

181
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:45.000
other kids couldn't catch up. Even though Benet,

182
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.890
wasn't trying to quantify genius.

183
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.090
Two psychologists independently took Bernay's model and tried to do just that.

184
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.770
The first was Lewis Terman.

185
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.890
If Benet was against the idea of ranking people by intelligence,

186
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.450
Terman was all for it,

187
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.740
inspired by Golden's theory of hereditary genius and Bearnaise mental ages.

188
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.030
Terman decided he was going to scientifically quantify intelligence to do so.

189
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:10.800
He applied a simple formula mental age divided by physical age times a hundred

190
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.590
equals intelligence quotient or IQ.

191
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.070
So if you can answer a question that a 10 year old can, and you're only five,

192
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.580
10 divided by five is two times a hundred is 200.

193
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.960
You're a genius with this simple calculus termin instituted the modern regime of

194
00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:26.790
IQ testing. As we know it today,

195
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.450
ranking and sorting everyone from school students to army recruits,

196
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.350
but this massive wave of testing brought to light and interesting fact as

197
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:35.280
English psychologist,

198
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.120
Charles Spearman first noted scores across different portions of different IQ

199
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:41.730
tests were positively correlated. In other words,

200
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.250
kids who were good at pattern recognition, for example,

201
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.760
we're also good at vocabulary and memorization intelligence.

202
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:51.450
It would seem wasn't tied to specific subjects or areas. Instead,

203
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:55.740
this statistical correlation implied what Spearman called general intelligence,

204
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.850
better known as G. We now had a modern conception of genius.

205
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.070
A genius was someone with a high IQ,

206
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.150
which made you smart about almost everything in committing to this view. We,

207
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:09.900
as a society had completed a U-turn on our pre enlightenment views.

208
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.340
Amos was no longer something that everyone possessed a characteristic or quirk

209
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:18.540
to explain their personality instead it's the domain of the hyper-intelligent

210
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.950
and we should Revere them for it.

211
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.820
So don't criticize Elon Musk for dipping his toes into predictive modeling.

212
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:27.030
And COVID-19 even if he's catastrophic the wrong and don't,

213
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:30.120
you dare think that Hawking vitamins is a cure for cancer is essentially a

214
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.250
multi-level marketing scheme with less steps.

215
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.290
We often give these people the benefit of the doubt,

216
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:36.660
just because they're seemingly much smarter than us,

217
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.060
or at least that's what the cultural narrative wants us to do.

218
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.900
It's the reason why Albert Einstein with zero political experience was offered

219
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:46.890
the presidency of Israel in 1952, because he's just so smart.

220
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.820
But Einstein understanding that his genius was not universal declined,

221
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.980
citing his complete and utter lack of experience in the matter.

222
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.280
And here's where we can understand how termin and Spearman got a lot about

223
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:00.670
intelligence law, despite its prominence in popular culture,

224
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.590
the IQ test and the concept of monolithic G has been under sustained attack

225
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:09.010
from psychologists for decades. The problem is that intelligence tests,

226
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.640
whether they're dealing with logical or spatial reasoning are only measuring

227
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:14.530
intelligence and a certain sense.

228
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.890
It's hard to see how an IQ test will spot the person who's going to make the

229
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:21.790
next big contribution to music or how a kid with impeccable spatial reasoning

230
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.360
will do in the floor is lava. According to psychologist, Robert Sternberg,

231
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.020
this is where most intelligence tests fail there,

232
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.810
refuse to look into the context of what they measure in Sternberg's view.

233
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.630
We're suffering from predictor criteria and confusion.

234
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.560
That's a fancy way of saying we're using IQ tests to reflect intelligence more

235
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:42.520
than real world problem solving to Sternberg intelligence has to take into

236
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:45.460
account the purpose of adaptation to shaping of,

237
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:49.630
and selection of real-world environments relevant to one's life. In other words,

238
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.730
intelligence doesn't occur in a vacuum.

239
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.600
Instead what's considered intelligence changes drastically between cultures,

240
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.370
environments, and situations.

241
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.060
While being able to spend hundreds of hours studying for the sat might make you

242
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:05.050
smart by ecologist standard for a Hunter gatherer intelligence might be linked

243
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:08.560
to the ability to orient yourself and your surroundings while tracking prey.

244
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.453
In both cases,

245
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.510
our intelligent human is adapting to real life scenarios to get what they want.

246
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.080
Even if these forms of intelligence are very different. Going back to Canada,

247
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.790
the only way to measure his specific brilliance is to hear his music.

248
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.590
So here's the big question. Wisecrack,

249
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.970
if our modern conception of genius rests on IQ tests that are kind of bunk and a

250
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:27.870
concept of gee,

251
00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:31.080
that might not really mean anything in a broader sense of intelligence,

252
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.380
is there really even such a thing as a genius at all? Sure.

253
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:38.100
Elon Musk has had moments of genius as did Linus Pauling before him.

254
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.580
But what if they're actually just smart people who happened to stumble upon some

255
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:44.190
breakthrough ideas, as it turns out there's some evidence.

256
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:48.120
This might be the case Terman in his quest for studying geniuses actually

257
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:51.780
embarked on one of the longest running longitudinal studies in history,

258
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.270
partnering with the California public school system.

259
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.560
He used IQ test to identify the most gifted children and then followed up with

260
00:13:58.561 --> 00:14:02.580
them for the next 35 years while Turman hoped to find the great men that

261
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.100
Carlisle theorized moved history. Instead,

262
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:10.050
most of his approximately 1500 geniuses went on to live normal lives in

263
00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:12.150
a devastating analysis sociologist.

264
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.410
Peter M Sorkin demonstrated the Turmans geniuses did just as well in life as a

265
00:14:16.411 --> 00:14:20.370
random sampling of kids from a similar socioeconomic status. In other words,

266
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:24.990
genius level IQ didn't produce any Linus Pauling's or Elon Musk's. In fact,

267
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.950
as journalist Malcolm Gladwell points out termin actually tested and ultimately

268
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:33.600
rejected two individuals who went on to win Nobel prizes, maybe genius,

269
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:38.010
isn't a number then, or rather the happy accident of a hardworking, lucky,

270
00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:39.690
and ultimately normal person.

271
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.930
And maybe they get a boost from specific kinds of reasoning skills,

272
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.140
Terence Tao the winner of the field's medal in 2006,

273
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.100
kind of like the Nobel prize for math except much more exclusive takes just this

274
00:14:50.101 --> 00:14:50.520
view.

275
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.250
He argues the popular image of the loan and possibly slightly mad genius who

276
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:58.850
ignores the literature and other conventional wisdom and manages by some

277
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.050
inexplicably inspiration to come up with a breathtakingly original solution to a

278
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:07.130
problem that confounded all the experts is a charming and romantic image,

279
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.670
but also a wildly inaccurate one to toe genius.

280
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.180
Isn't the result of the great men that Carlisle proposed. Instead,

281
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:17.900
the genius stands as hop the shoulders of those that came before who small

282
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:21.530
incremental advances led to the geniuses breakthrough. It's not brilliant.

283
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.940
It's simply progress obtained naturally and cumulatively as a consequence of

284
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.660
hard work directed by intuition literature and a bit of luck.

285
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.570
But what do you think wise crack did the simulation just short us,

286
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:36.110
the intelligence needed to fully appreciate the legend that is Elon Musk.
