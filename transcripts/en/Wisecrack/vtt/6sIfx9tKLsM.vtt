<v 0>This video is brought to you by Epic games.</v>

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.290
<v 1>What's up wisecrack Michael here.</v>

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.100
Do you ever wonder what's happening in your subconscious when you're sleeping?

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.790
Have you ever struggled to trace the origin of an idea or thought that you've

5
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:17.450
had,

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.330
and have you ever considered purchasing an international airline to help you

7
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:23.870
effectively pull off a dream heist? Well, on this episode of the good,

8
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.930
the bad and the brilliant we'll get into all of this and more by breaking down

9
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.530
the 2010 film inception and this film, we watch a team of experts,

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.610
dream thieves, pull off an elaborate heist that involves implanting an idea.

11
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:38.150
Three dreams deep into the consciousness of an unsuspecting rich dude.

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.110
Things get very weird and evil dream goes to tries to thwart their plans.

13
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:42.944
And at the end,

14
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.880
we don't know what's real and what's not to help me avoid getting trapped in

15
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.380
limbo. I am joined by.

16
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.320
<v 2>Jared Michael, you son of a I'm in awe.</v>

17
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.130
<v 1>I love it. Um, we're going to have some fun Darlene. Okay. Jared.</v>

18
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:59.300
So inception is a, I think we could say multilayered and pretty complex film.

19
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.000
Yes. I'm excited that you're gonna help me break it down even more,

20
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.370
but let's start by talking about what's good.

21
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:07.820
So what is something that you think is good about the movie inception?

22
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.031
<v 2>Well,</v>

23
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:11.420
you already just said complex and I would say that it's a complicated film and

24
00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:12.620
it's a complex film.

25
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.520
I say complicated because I think that just discerning what happens on a very

26
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:18.740
basic plot level is pretty challenging.

27
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:23.570
And one of the most special things about this movie is that it makes people want

28
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:27.470
to go to that coffee shop and discuss the movie, break it down layer by layer.

29
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:31.280
But I also think it's a very complex film because it really does invite multiple

30
00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:34.610
interpretations. And I think that's the Mark of a really special movie,

31
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.110
but I think this movie really is for a younger generation than myself,

32
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.700
kind of the matrix of that generation, because it makes you question reality.

33
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:46.760
It makes you question whether or not you can tell the difference between

34
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
dreaming and sleeping like Descartes or something like that.

35
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.950
And it's also a reminder that original and challenging ideas can

36
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:59.120
still be accepted and celebrated on a wide scale.

37
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.990
And that's something that we unfortunately get so rarely that the matrix was

38
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:06.350
also proof of this movie actually made way more money than the matrix.

39
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:10.580
So this was just kind of a big celebratory moment for all fans of

40
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.450
cranial, geeky, scifi and stuff like that. So, yeah,

41
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:18.710
so this movie has a special place in my heart just because it is just another

42
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.130
necessary movie that had to happen to say, no,

43
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.180
we can invest in original ideas. We can invest in things that seem challenging.

44
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.080
There was an urban legend that nobody even knew what the movie was about when it

45
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:32.690
was being produced. Like not even the actors knew it was happening.

46
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.660
Another thing that I find pretty impressive about this movie is the opening

47
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:37.790
scene because a lot of this movie,

48
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:42.770
just by nature of how complicated it is is needs exposition to even understand

49
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:46.730
how the rules work. But that opening scene introduces us to so many things,

50
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:48.500
whether it's the fact that when you get shot,

51
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.940
you wake up in a dream or the idea of multiple dream levels or the idea of how

52
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.190
Cobb's trauma with his wife manifests in endangering missions and stuff

53
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:01.030
like that. And even like kick, right. I think we get that and we get the kick,

54
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.220
all of that is established through action.

55
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.100
And I think it's so important to do that first,

56
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.710
before we get into the big information dump section,

57
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.350
because that first part is just so exciting.

58
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.990
And so I think it's really clever how he structured that.

59
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.740
<v 1>No, I think you're right. And in rewatching it for the first time in a while,</v>

60
00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:20.880
I was struck by everything you just said and how bold the first scene is,

61
00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:23.190
like how much they really jump into it.

62
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.730
And the boldness of Nolan to start a movie that's taking place inside of a

63
00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:29.430
dream. And we don't know what's inside of a dream yet and letting that unfold.

64
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.910
<v 2>Great. You don't know what's going on, but, are you curious?</v>

65
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.990
<v 1>It's a rip off something you said, and especially the matrix comparison,</v>

66
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.750
something I like about this, and maybe that might sound negative, but I mean,

67
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:40.710
in a positive way,

68
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.270
it inspired a lot of dorm room philosophy and my dorm room philosophy kind of

69
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:46.890
similar to what you talked about with coffee shops,

70
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.490
thinking of the sort of movies that inspired deep discussion about what it

71
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:54.540
really means and the questioning of reality and things that maybe you're going

72
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:56.760
to talk about this in concert with some books you're reading,

73
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.070
or maybe you're just throwing around ideas while you're stoned with your

74
00:03:59.071 --> 00:03:59.904
buddies.

75
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.210
But I think this movie inspires a lot of those big questions and I think a lot

76
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:07.950
of the best films have that kind of matrix and inception genre do that

77
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.790
inspire thought, inspire questions and leave a lot of things up in the air.

78
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.860
And I think this movie definitely does that.

79
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.390
<v 2>Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.200
One of the other things I think that he does so well is create a system of

81
00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:23.400
rules. This movie is all about establishing rules and then for better or worse,

82
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.740
it takes a long time to establish these rules.

83
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.960
But the rules really do work in concert with the way that we

84
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:34.770
experienced dreams, the idea of nesting time within dreams,

85
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.560
that's something that, you know, we can fall asleep for an hour,

86
00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:39.780
but it feels like we've almost lived an entire lifetime.

87
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.920
That's the first time we ever saw that in a movie. And that was really special.

88
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.730
<v 1>Yeah. Well, in rewatching it, I was pausing to take notes of the rule. So like,</v>

89
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:50.250
okay, if you're one level, this is how much time you're two levels.

90
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.340
This is how much time. And even like keeping track of where they were,

91
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:56.640
what they were doing in the rules of that place. It's kind of demanding.

92
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:59.430
And on first watch, I think it's easy to not pay attention to that,

93
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.100
but it is interesting that when you rewatch this film,

94
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.780
you can pay more attention,

95
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:08.760
go deeper and try your best to understand the rules of the unconscious as

96
00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:09.630
outlined by Christopher.

97
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.960
<v 2>Oh, just the premise of this movie is probably the coolest thing about it.</v>

98
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.291
I mean,

99
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:18.210
just that a dream thief enters your mind in order to incept you or

100
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:22.950
extract the most powerful thing in the world and idea. I mean,

101
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.790
even just that log line, if someone were to pitch that to me, I'd be like, okay,

102
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:28.770
great. But how are you going to actually make that into a movie?

103
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:33.300
And I think that the ambition of the idea it does show and just how many genres

104
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:35.520
this movie has to juggle. I mean, it's a drama.

105
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:39.270
We get the love drama between Maul and cob. It's a heist movie,

106
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.550
it's an action movie and all of them work in concert to create

107
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:48.840
something that even if you're not aware of what's going on at each second,

108
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:53.310
it still builds to a moment of catharsis that works whether or not you're able

109
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.640
to say what exactly is happening in the snow level,

110
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.050
because there are a lot of dramatic beats that go by so quickly.

111
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.120
But one of the great things about Nolan is that he doesn't really care

112
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.700
much to hold the audience's hand through pop points,

113
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.060
because he's very aware that there are so many other things in the filmmaker's

114
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:15.830
toolkit, whether it's sound design or composition or things like that,

115
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.640
that will communicate the stakes more so than dialogue.

116
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.540
I remember when the trailer for the dark Knight rises came out and no one could

117
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:27.170
understand what Bain said, sorry, it wasn't the trailer. It was, uh,

118
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.700
before mission impossible for there was like the extended intro I showed.

119
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.790
<v 1>Who I was till I put on the Mars.</v>

120
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.090
<v 2>And he defended himself against people who said, this is stupid.</v>

121
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:39.770
We can't understand what Bain said. And he said,

122
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.640
it doesn't really matter if you can actually understand every single word,

123
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:47.960
because the general tone or the context or the atmosphere that I've built will

124
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:51.260
give you enough information. And people made fun of him for it.

125
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.650
And he eventually did cave and concede and reward those main lines.

126
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.210
But that's always something that I've admired about Nolan is that he's willing

127
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:03.320
to challenge the audience to the point where even his editor says that people

128
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:04.910
don't understand his movies,

129
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.890
meaning that he's going through and putting in beats that are seconds

130
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:13.460
long, knowing that it will go straight past the audience's head.

131
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.430
But it doesn't matter because they're going to understand that the stakes are

132
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:18.980
rising. They understand the overarching stakes,

133
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:21.830
but not necessarily the specific beats. And it still works.

134
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.590
<v 1>I also think at a more basic level, it's just such a visually stunning thing.</v>

135
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.720
Absolutely. It's so styled, everyone looks so cool in it as well.

136
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.670
So it's a fun world too.

137
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.200
<v 2>It's a fun world to be in.</v>

138
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:39.220
And it's just so impressive how they created four different color palettes to

139
00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:40.990
express four different worlds.

140
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.940
And what I understand there was no actual coloring and post-production all of

141
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:47.320
that was done in camera,

142
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.030
just because Christopher Nolan is a purist and he levels these kinds of

143
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:54.730
ridiculous challenges at himself just to be the best.

144
00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.460
And I think it pays off because more to my point about not needing the

145
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.130
dialogue to necessarily communicate every plot point.

146
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.120
He can just do that visually because a lot of,

147
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.010
a lot of this movie is juxtaposing between different dream levels.

148
00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:12.070
And the fact that you can tell visually that they're distinct from one another,

149
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:13.150
like one of them is raining.

150
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.480
One of them is colored a little bit more blue than the other one.

151
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:20.890
One of them has much more of like a warm reddish hue inside that hotel.

152
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.880
And so we're constantly able to understand what's going on.

153
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.610
<v 1>Something I like about the film is even when it doesn't work, it's still good.</v>

154
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.990
And for that, I mean,

155
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.430
even at times where I wonder if that plot is collapsing onto itself,

156
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.460
if certain threads aren't coming together, the way he wants them to,

157
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.630
that never gets in the way of the movie being so visually impressive and

158
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:44.590
compelling. The part of the movie that I think gets this really well is the, uh,

159
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.630
the fight scene that takes place in this spinning.

160
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.120
<v 2>Hallway, the shot of the movie. Yeah.</v>

161
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.410
<v 1>And the fact that they constructed that. And I think that commitment to not,</v>

162
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.090
I don't want to say cheaping out cause I movies cost so much money to make. Um,

163
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.570
but rather than doing effects in post or CGI or whatever,

164
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.190
building an entire spinning hallway to do that pays off. So wow.

165
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.260
<v 2>Seen that set and it's very reminiscent to the set that they built for 2001,</v>

166
00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:13.520
a space Odyssey where the woman walks up the circular hallway.

167
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.450
<v 1>Just a great thing about Nolan films in general. I mean, not to veer too much,</v>

168
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.280
but like it's something that works really well in Dunkirk.

169
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.080
The fact that he made a lot of that stuff actually happen and insisted on having

170
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.000
actual effects, not doing everything in post.

171
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.230
It really pays off in the intensity of the film. But before we continue,

172
00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:32.720
I want to give a shout out to this week, sponsor house party,

173
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.300
a free to download app, LinkedIn, the description,

174
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.000
if you're feeling bored and want to connect with friends,

175
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.270
Houseparty is a fun app that allows you to call them and play games while you

176
00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:44.750
hang out. The app features, heads up chips and guac, quick draw,

177
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.490
and my personal favorite trivia.

178
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.090
They even give you fun facts while you wait for your party to join the call,

179
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.140
add friends via contacts, Facebook, and even Snapchat to get the party started.

180
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.800
Eight friends can be in the same room at once. And the more people,

181
00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:01.820
the more fun the games you can even invite friends who don't have each other's

182
00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:03.170
contacts into the mix.

183
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.950
It's a great way to stay connected during times when friends and family feels so

184
00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:07.784
far away.

185
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.840
So change up the quarantine conversation and download Houseparty today.

186
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.840
Houseparty is free to download and available on iOS,

187
00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:19.430
Android Macko S and Chrome click the link in description to download the app.

188
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.370
Now back to the show. Okay. I'm sure we could.

189
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:25.340
We could go on and talk about more things we like about this movie,

190
00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:29.270
but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we didn't also consider what doesn't work

191
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.040
and inception. So give me something.

192
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.560
<v 2>You think is bad about this movie, you know,</v>

193
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:37.340
bad is kind of a hard term to level at this movie,

194
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:40.160
but there are things that I think are a little bit disappointing.

195
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.730
And I think one of it is that some of the biggest action set pieces,

196
00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:47.510
the most impressive ones and most visually stunning ones are only for the sake

197
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:52.130
of exposition. So for example, the streets of Paris exploding,

198
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.460
when DiCaprio's explaining to Ellen page, how dreams work,

199
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.090
that's really just something that teaches the audience, how dreams work.

200
00:10:59.091 --> 00:10:59.631
But man,

201
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:03.740
I would love to see that kind of explosion happening during an action sequence

202
00:11:03.741 --> 00:11:08.570
where the tension is high more so with the whole thing with the city folding

203
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.450
in upon itself, that's the coolest, most iconic visual,

204
00:11:11.451 --> 00:11:14.690
except for maybe the Joseph Gordon-Levitt hallway scene, which we talked about,

205
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:17.570
but at a close second is the city folding in on itself,

206
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.620
which is such a cool thing.

207
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.070
And I would love to see Leonardo DiCaprio being chased by somebody with a folded

208
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:24.260
over city. But again,

209
00:11:24.261 --> 00:11:28.790
it's just shown almost as pure spectacle because another thing that's a little

210
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:32.270
bit disappointing about this movie is the rule that he establishes that your

211
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:35.930
subconscious will come attack you if you change the world too much.

212
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.170
And the only reason for that is because I think it inhibits the creativity of

213
00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:42.020
what can happen when they're actually in the dream. So again,

214
00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:45.590
I would love to see Ariadne just constantly creating throughout that,

215
00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:48.440
like she's playing a video game, like she's playing dreams,

216
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:51.470
that new game that's out for PlayStation four or whatever.

217
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:56.530
So much of this movie is a celebration of the creative process and not

218
00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:01.330
being able to see Ari Adonai doing her architecture is kind of a

219
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:02.710
missed opportunity, I think.

220
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.091
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:12:03.091 --> 00:12:06.870
And I think that emphasis on the movie spending too much time on exposition

222
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.640
makes sense of a lot of the flaws.

223
00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:12.600
So one thing that I don't really like about the movie is that, you know,

224
00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:17.580
Ariadne is like really the only female character that isn't just like

225
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.770
in Leonardo, DiCaprio's unconscious in the film.

226
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.430
And her main role in this movie is to ask why almost everything she says in this

227
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:26.880
movie is like, why does this work like this way? How does this happen this way?

228
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.300
<v 3>You got draw from stuff, you know, right. Only use details, uh,</v>

229
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.100
a street lamp or a phone booth,

230
00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:36.480
never entire areas because building a dream from your memory is the easiest way

231
00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:39.210
to lose your grasp on what's real. And what is a dream?

232
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.193
Is that what happened to you.

233
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.840
<v 1>There to sort of represent the audience,</v>

234
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.120
asking what the hell is happening right now?

235
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.070
Because there's so much to establish. Yeah.

236
00:12:47.071 --> 00:12:50.550
And it just sort of a waste of a really interesting character and it's still a

237
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:52.830
good character Ellen page crushes in that role.

238
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.420
But I would have liked to see more in that particular role right there. Um.

239
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.300
<v 2>A lot of that could have been achieved if you just made her character a little</v>

240
00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:03.690
bit more active and given the architect role less of a, well,

241
00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:06.600
she already did the work before the actual high starts,

242
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.260
which is how it works now and actually have her building throughout the dream.

243
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.610
By the way that train sequence,

244
00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:14.640
I would have loved to have seen more stuff like that. I mean,

245
00:13:14.641 --> 00:13:16.350
seeing a train with no track,

246
00:13:16.351 --> 00:13:20.640
just plowing through downtown Los Angeles when a training that is such a cool

247
00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:21.360
image.

248
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.010
And I wanted to see more kind of Satoshi con paprika level,

249
00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:30.000
crazy stuff in a dream. You know, I don't know about your dreams, my goals,

250
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.100
my dreams get pretty weird and.

251
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.870
<v 1>Well, well, we might get to that later.</v>

252
00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:36.090
So I won't let you go too deep into that one,

253
00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:39.000
but something you mentioned before was the way in which Christopher Nolan

254
00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:40.320
establishes so many rules.

255
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.250
Now this is a point where I get how that works for the sake of the film.

256
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.060
I do think there's a missed opportunity in the exploration of the unconscious

257
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.170
and dreams in particular.

258
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.100
So one of the things about dreams and especially if we're thinking about like

259
00:13:53.101 --> 00:13:56.790
the psychoanalytic tradition is they're not linear, they're pretty weird.

260
00:13:56.791 --> 00:13:58.500
The rules of reality don't apply.

261
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.750
So I wonder if there was a more interesting place to go both with this story and

262
00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:04.860
even visually kind of,

263
00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:09.180
as you referenced before to make those dreams pop,

264
00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:11.640
to really push the limits of that.

265
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.630
I get how that would have complicated an already complicated film a lot more,

266
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.690
but that is something that I couldn't help.

267
00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.580
But think about when watching this film again.

268
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.160
<v 2>The thing that we mentioned in the good section,</v>

269
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:26.460
but I think it could almost equally work as bad as the fact that even the editor

270
00:14:26.461 --> 00:14:29.340
of the film says that people don't know what's going on in his movies.

271
00:14:29.341 --> 00:14:33.600
And I think that for the most part, for most of the dream levels, I was,

272
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.060
I think, beat for beat following what was going on.

273
00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:39.600
But I think everything kind of goes to hell with the snow level.

274
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.290
And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that Tom Hardy's character

275
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.740
and, uh, the guy who plays cyto, they're all masked up.

276
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.430
So it's really hard to follow who's doing what, uh,

277
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.560
but also just the number of changes in beats that happen in that scene.

278
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.460
There are so many,

279
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.460
and some of them are communicated with just like the smallest bit of dialogue.

280
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.060
So it can be a little bit frustrating, but again,

281
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.360
it mostly works for those other elements that I mentioned before.

282
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.160
<v 1>Yeah. The other thing I don't like, and this is very minor, I don't like that.</v>

283
00:15:09.161 --> 00:15:12.940
The main not motivation for Leonardo DiCaprio's character cob,

284
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.630
but the reason they get into this heist to begin with is so some super

285
00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:20.440
billionaire guy can stop another company from competing with him.

286
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.350
And there's the line about like, Oh, there'd be an energy monopoly.

287
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.590
It's like my guy, you just bought an airline to do this highest.

288
00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.790
I just don't think like that to try to moralize it in some way.

289
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:34.210
Like this is like, Oh great. We're, we're breaking up the big corporations,

290
00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:38.650
like come on. And I get Cobb's motivation once these kids get back to America,

291
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.440
but also the why can't you just take the kids to France? I won't get into that.

292
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.303
They have this.

293
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.510
<v 2>Offscreen character of the shrewd mother-in-law that they kind of have that</v>

294
00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:48.750
establishes, like why they can't go to France.

295
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.011
<v 1>And then too,</v>

296
00:15:51.011 --> 00:15:54.310
like she's presumably married to the Michael Kane character and he's like,

297
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.830
I'll hang out with the guy that everyone thinks killed my daughter,

298
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.800
my wife though, she's out on that. But there's some loose ends.

299
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.250
It is what it is. This movie. Doesn't try to explain all those things.

300
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:05.200
I'm nitpicking a bit before we move on.

301
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.650
Any other thing that's bad about this movie that you wanted to bring out?

302
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.550
<v 2>You had already brought up that Ariadne is basically just an expository tool.</v>

303
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.290
Um, and yeah,

304
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.770
I just want to reiterate that I think her character had the potential to be the

305
00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:19.750
most active and cool character,

306
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.760
but she played an unnecessary role that I understand again,

307
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.830
creating this whole complex,

308
00:16:26.831 --> 00:16:30.130
complicated world within two and a half hours,

309
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.000
you're going to have to implement some sort of a tool like that to make sure

310
00:16:34.001 --> 00:16:36.340
that the audience is getting all the information that they need,

311
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.570
not only with how the world works, but also with Cobb's past,

312
00:16:39.571 --> 00:16:43.960
because so much of the romance between Cobb and Maul is just flashbacks.

313
00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:46.090
And we need some sort of motivation for that flashback,

314
00:16:46.091 --> 00:16:49.630
unless you just want Leonardo DiCaprio looking in a mirror and then we just fade

315
00:16:49.631 --> 00:16:53.920
to white and then we see a flashback, which you know, uh,

316
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:54.641
I don't know.

317
00:16:54.641 --> 00:16:57.790
I think that would feel a little bit strange for a movie made in 2010. Yeah.

318
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.910
<v 1>But I think the main takeaway from all of this is almost everything we said that</v>

319
00:17:00.911 --> 00:17:03.880
was bad, except some of the minor points are necessary.

320
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.770
Evils of what makes the movie good. Right.

321
00:17:05.771 --> 00:17:07.990
So if you're going to have bad stuff in your film,

322
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.910
have it work to make the film good. So I think we agree on that. Done. Good,

323
00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:15.310
done bad. I know you're excited to get to the brilliant.

324
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.640
We break down the big ideas, but first we gotta do the lightning round. Um,

325
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.200
so I assume you came with crashes.

326
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.820
<v 2>Okay. With questions, Michael,</v>

327
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.150
if you could incept your girlfriend with any idea, what would it be? Oh,

328
00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:26.140
that's so real.

329
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.050
<v 1>I would make her like live music more. Um,</v>

330
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:32.530
I love going to concerts and she doesn't like coming with me. Cause then I'm,

331
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.450
she gets anxious and like crowds.

332
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.380
So I would incept her with that idea that she needed to like be out more live

333
00:17:38.381 --> 00:17:40.870
music and that'd be so much fun. So if you see this, I'm sorry.

334
00:17:40.871 --> 00:17:43.750
I would never really do that. I would never, I would never,

335
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.220
what is the weirdest dream you've had that you remember that can comfortably say

336
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:51.054
in this context.

337
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.053
<v 2>Man,</v>

338
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:58.160
I once had a dream that I was fighting the whole cast of mortal

339
00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:02.330
combat and I was losing and it was a bad dream. That's dark. Yeah.

340
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.600
<v 1>I'm glad you survived the kick in that one. Must've been very hard. Yeah.</v>

341
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.960
<v 2>It was bad. I mean, no fatalities, luckily. Nice.</v>

342
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.680
If you had to extract a piece of knowledge from one person living today,

343
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.540
who would it be and what would you extract?

344
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.390
<v 1>Okay. So in some of the original, um,</v>

345
00:18:17.391 --> 00:18:20.660
hot chicken shops in Nashville Prince's and Bolton's,

346
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.260
they have these spice mixes that they don't tell anyone what they are.

347
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.180
They're very militant about this.

348
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.170
It'd be cool to extract the spice mix to the original style of Nashville.

349
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.530
<v 2>Chicken is instead of corporate, espionage is small business espionage.</v>

350
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.100
<v 1>Now I feel really bad. I wouldn't do that. I would,</v>

351
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.640
I would extract a Jeff Bezos. That was the law's money.

352
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.860
<v 2>That was a great answer.</v>

353
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.200
If you could live an extra lifetime with a loved one in the span of one second

354
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.900
of this lifetime, would you do it? No.

355
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.890
<v 1>Why not? Well, a w in the sample size of the film,</v>

356
00:18:54.891 --> 00:18:59.120
50% of the people that went down that road killed themselves because of the way

357
00:18:59.121 --> 00:19:00.410
it ravaged their psyche.

358
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.240
So I just think if we're doing risk award reward analysis,

359
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.380
I just think it's worth it.

360
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.071
<v 2>Well, hold on.</v>

361
00:19:07.071 --> 00:19:09.860
That person killed themselves because they were incepted with the idea to

362
00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:12.620
question their reality and they just kept questioning their reality.

363
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.420
<v 1>I here's what I still think.</v>

364
00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:17.720
I think that one of the joys of life is its finitude.

365
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.890
And I think that because we know that life's about a certain amount of time,

366
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.030
but if I go do 50 years and then I come back and I got to live a bunch of

367
00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:26.630
longer,

368
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.540
I could technically get up to the point in my life where my lived experience is

369
00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:31.910
like 130 years. I'm gonna be bored at that point.

370
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.130
What do you think is Christopher Nolan's best?

371
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.310
<v 2>The dark night? Great. That one was super as simple as that.</v>

372
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.550
If no one was hired to direct the next installment of a known franchise,

373
00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:43.070
which one would you want it to be in? Why? Ooh.

374
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.230
<v 1>This is fun. Um, see, I know that this movie's already been made,</v>

375
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.490
so this is obviously could never happen. I mean, let him do a matrix movie.

376
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.370
Ooh, let him do like a second matrix trilogy.

377
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.630
And I think his aesthetics and storytelling would actually.

378
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.160
<v 2>Work better. I'm excited. I mean,</v>

379
00:20:01.161 --> 00:20:04.130
I'm excited to see what Lana comes up with the matrix for,

380
00:20:04.131 --> 00:20:07.100
but I might even be more excited if no one does.

381
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.590
<v 1>I think that would be the level of excitement.</v>

382
00:20:09.591 --> 00:20:12.380
I think if they announced Christopher Nolan was going to do a matrix movie

383
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:13.214
through the roof. Yeah.

384
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.510
<v 2>With Lana supervision maybe of course, with supervision or just blessing. Yeah.</v>

385
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:18.470
Okay. Jared.

386
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.130
<v 1>Of you were a part of the dream heist team. What skill would you bring?</v>

387
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.150
<v 2>Whatever Eames does, whatever Tom Hardy's got to do and having other characters,</v>

388
00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:27.710
I guess he's kind of like the actor.

389
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.110
<v 1>In, I think he's like the forger.</v>

390
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.410
<v 2>Forges people. Yeah. That would be fun. I was.</v>

391
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.540
<v 1>Really funny. He killed it. Okay. I like that. And that's a good role.</v>

392
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.540
<v 2>Yeah. You got another one for me. I do. And this is kind of a trick question.</v>

393
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.710
Ready? Oh, this is a pot possibly going to offend some people,

394
00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:46.190
but who is Nolan's most interesting female character.

395
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.860
<v 1>This is so messed up. Um, I think Maggie,</v>

396
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:57.580
Jill and Hall's character and the dark night. Very good. Pretty fleshed out.

397
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.820
I think the reason it's hard to answer this question is because Christopher

398
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.550
Nolan does a bad job of creating interesting roles for women in his films.

399
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.470
It is what it is.

400
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.560
<v 2>I don't think he tries very hard cause he just knows that that's not as</v>

401
00:21:07.561 --> 00:21:11.100
strength. And I'm fine with that. Some dudes are just dude centric and I'm cool.

402
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.353
<v 4>That.</v>

403
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.530
<v 1>I don't know. I would like him to try better. We'll see.</v>

404
00:21:16.531 --> 00:21:18.600
It does not look like anytime soon.

405
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.390
<v 2>No, there's no good Christopher Nolan's sex scenes.</v>

406
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.450
It's because he's probably just, he's a cranial guy. He's not a sexy guy.

407
00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:25.290
Let him, let them.

408
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.240
<v 1>I have already has never had sex over the Christopher. Nolan is an adult Virgin.</v>

409
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.940
Who's never had sex lives in a sexless marriage.

410
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.770
And his children are via the extraction from his testicles directly implanted

411
00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:41.640
into his wife to have kids never had sex. Tell everyone, well,

412
00:21:41.641 --> 00:21:44.820
this has been a fun lightning round and thank you for participating. And um,

413
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.280
now that we've done good, bad and lightening round,

414
00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:49.470
it's time to get into the big ideas in this film,

415
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.850
the stuff that makes you think.

416
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:55.050
So we'll get into the brilliant and you can start us off by telling us what's

417
00:21:55.051 --> 00:21:56.100
something about in steps.

418
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.690
<v 2>That you think is brilliant. Well,</v>

419
00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:00.150
I mentioned this already a little bit in the good section,

420
00:22:00.151 --> 00:22:04.710
but I really admire how this film inspires so many different interpretations.

421
00:22:04.711 --> 00:22:08.130
And there's one in particular that I've glommed on to that even in interviews,

422
00:22:08.131 --> 00:22:09.930
Christopher Nolan has been approached about.

423
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.610
And that is how inception is about the creative process of making a film.

424
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.360
Have you heard about this? Right? Yeah.

425
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.820
So there's something very brilliant in how there's a scene where cob is

426
00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:23.840
explaining to Arianna how the logic of dreams work. And he said.

427
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.130
<v 4>Never really remember the beginning of a dream.</v>

428
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:31.710
Did you always wind up right in the middle of what's going on? I guess. Yeah.

429
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.050
<v 2>A lot of people have interpreted this as being,</v>

430
00:22:34.051 --> 00:22:38.310
as Nolan pointing to the fact that sometimes a scene will just start and you're

431
00:22:38.311 --> 00:22:40.890
in the middle of a conversation. You don't know how they got there.

432
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.450
Just like they don't know how they got to this place in the dream world.

433
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:50.610
And so this opens up a whole awesome world of questions about this

434
00:22:50.611 --> 00:22:55.110
movie. So when we cut to things like the establishing shot of moon bossa,

435
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.830
we ask ourselves like, okay, well there was some narrative ellipses there.

436
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.620
So does that mean that we're supposed to question whether this is a dream or

437
00:23:01.621 --> 00:23:02.190
not,

438
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:06.090
and then it really draws this really interesting comparison to how the logic of

439
00:23:06.091 --> 00:23:08.310
movies works, like the logic of dreams.

440
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.900
So every time we see something like when they're in Mombasa and DiCaprio is

441
00:23:12.901 --> 00:23:16.560
being chased, he's running through an alleyway that narrows to almost a point.

442
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.540
And you're saying to yourself now,

443
00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:23.160
is that just something that a filmmaker is using its film logic to just

444
00:23:23.161 --> 00:23:26.070
heighten the stakes? Or is it an indication that it's a dream?

445
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.860
And then cyto all of a sudden just shows up, well, you know,

446
00:23:28.861 --> 00:23:31.560
what is he doing there? And then we ask ourselves, well,

447
00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:35.610
is that just convenient movie logic? Or is that the logic of dreams?

448
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.510
And this comparison I've always thought was just so brilliant. And as of,

449
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.531
as a film lover,

450
00:23:40.531 --> 00:23:42.900
and one of the greatest things about Christopher Nolan is that he's a film

451
00:23:42.901 --> 00:23:43.620
lover.

452
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:48.170
It's just a really amazing love letter to

453
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:48.890
cinema.

454
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.510
And it's interesting that in a great wired article that I recommend everybody

455
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:54.344
read,

456
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.350
they interview Christopher Nolan and they actually asked him if this is what he

457
00:23:57.351 --> 00:23:59.690
was thinking when he was writing the movie. And he said, no,

458
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.640
but it's clearly there.

459
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.520
And he actually has this great quote that speaks to a lot of what we do.

460
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:05.300
He says,

461
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.480
one of the things that you do as a writer and as a filmmaker is grasp for

462
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:09.381
resonance, symbols,

463
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:12.440
and imagery without necessarily fully understanding it yourself.

464
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.600
There are interpretations to be imposed on the film.

465
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:16.520
That aren't necessarily what I had in my head.

466
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.940
And it doesn't even have to be necessarily interpretation of what's real or not

467
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.710
is Cobb dreaming at the end or not.

468
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:26.390
But these meta readings about the creative process that are so unique to this

469
00:24:26.391 --> 00:24:30.080
story about dreams and creation that I just find really special.

470
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.630
<v 1>Yeah. That's really interesting.</v>

471
00:24:31.631 --> 00:24:35.020
And I read the article you're talking about as well, everyone should. It's good.

472
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.320
And I think Nolan's no one's ability to be like,

473
00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.390
this might not be what I intended, but yeah, it's also true is really great. Uh,

474
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.710
and I think it almost acknowledges like the unconsciousness of a filmmaker.

475
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.350
Who's doing stuff. Maybe not even realizing he's doing it,

476
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.740
which kind of leads into the thing. I find the most brilliant in this film.

477
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.430
And not that this is something it's intentionally doing throughout,

478
00:24:57.431 --> 00:25:01.220
but something that's really interesting to think about is the theme and the

479
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.820
function of repression. Um, so of course,

480
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.980
Maul and a lot of ways is a repressed symptom of trauma

481
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.520
in Cobb's unconscious. Something that's happened that was horrible,

482
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.360
that he's pushed down so far, but the repression wants to get out.

483
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.360
Now this is something that's in a lot of ways can be pulled right from Sigmund

484
00:25:19.361 --> 00:25:24.010
Freud. So I have a quote here. This was when, when Freud first introduced the,

485
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.510
uh, category of repression and he said, and this is him talking about patients.

486
00:25:27.511 --> 00:25:28.344
He was seeing.

487
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.170
So as there was some force that prevented them from becoming conscious and

488
00:25:32.171 --> 00:25:35.920
compel them to remain unconscious, push the pathogenetic experiences.

489
00:25:35.921 --> 00:25:37.300
In question out of consciousness,

490
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.660
I gave the name of repression to this hypothetical process.

491
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.790
So repression for Freud is when something happens that our mind sort of

492
00:25:45.791 --> 00:25:47.770
puts away for us, tries to keep down.

493
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.960
But the repressed memory keeps trying to like break into our conscious mind, um,

494
00:25:52.961 --> 00:25:54.310
and sort of disrupts patterns.

495
00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:57.880
That's why a lot of times people might experience trauma as a child or some

496
00:25:57.881 --> 00:25:59.880
horrific event and they push it down,

497
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.400
push it down and it might be 30 years later that that's popping up and haunting

498
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:05.650
them. And I think that through them all character,

499
00:26:05.651 --> 00:26:08.470
the film explores that idea in a really interesting way.

500
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.880
And even if we read the film or that part as sort of a metaphor,

501
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:18.040
it's reminding us that past trauma can be ghost these things that haunt us,

502
00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:19.570
these things that we can't get rid of.

503
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.510
And even if they don't actually exist as specters,

504
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.450
they're already deeply inside our unconscious mind,

505
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.770
which is wild to think about.

506
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:30.790
Cause all of us have things like that floating around our subconscious mind that

507
00:26:30.791 --> 00:26:33.400
we're not aware of that might pop up at any point.

508
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.880
And I think the movie gets at the implications of that and a really interest.

509
00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:42.400
<v 2>We actually have an actual physical embodiment of his trauma who</v>

510
00:26:42.401 --> 00:26:45.570
is messing with his life and, you know,

511
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:50.520
having your trauma be the antagonist of the film or at least of select scenes is

512
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:51.354
something really cool.

513
00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.200
<v 1>Oh definitely. And I think kind of connected to that.</v>

514
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.950
There's some fun ideas to pick apart in terms of how memory functions,

515
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.530
because I at least wonder when I watched this film,

516
00:27:00.531 --> 00:27:05.510
how much of what the cob Leonardo DiCaprio's character is remembering about

517
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.190
Maul actually happened?

518
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.990
How much of that is shaped by his own remembering of his memories

519
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.740
and something we know sort of a psychological and neurological level.

520
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.070
We do this weird thing where we have a thing that happened to us.

521
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.870
We remember that, but by reremembering it, we can modify it. We can change it.

522
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.360
So eventually we get further on and as adults,

523
00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:29.750
we have to acknowledge that some of our childhood memories might've drifted

524
00:27:29.751 --> 00:27:32.150
pretty far away from what actually happened.

525
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.920
So you wonder that in the film as well,

526
00:27:33.921 --> 00:27:38.870
how much of the re inscription of these memories is shaping then

527
00:27:38.871 --> 00:27:40.850
who Maul is? Yeah, absolutely.

528
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.720
<v 2>And I think that's what he discovers at the end when he decides not to stay with</v>

529
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.440
mall and limbo first and foremost is because he realized that she's just a shade

530
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.350
of the full woman that he wants to.

531
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.650
<v 1>Yeah. And there's something that's so real and melancholic about that.</v>

532
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.170
Cause in our own lives like people, whether it's friends,

533
00:27:57.171 --> 00:28:00.410
we just don't see any more people who have passed the memory of the person is

534
00:28:00.411 --> 00:28:04.070
never quite the person. It's always a shell of something real.

535
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.380
So I really liked that level of exploring how memory functions,

536
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.580
what else did you find? Brilliant.

537
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.840
<v 2>I'm going to go back to the Metta reading about film because as a film lover,</v>

538
00:28:14.841 --> 00:28:16.640
this is the one that resonates with me the most,

539
00:28:16.641 --> 00:28:20.540
but on top of the fact that the logic of dreams run parallel for the logic of

540
00:28:20.541 --> 00:28:21.320
cinema,

541
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.280
something really interesting is that the whole idea of incepting somebody with

542
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:29.360
an idea of planting a seed of thought in someone's head as something that cinema

543
00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:30.830
does to people that view it.

544
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.640
I find to be really awesome because that's something that's actually happened to

545
00:28:34.641 --> 00:28:35.151
me. I mean,

546
00:28:35.151 --> 00:28:39.050
I've made blogs on this channel before about how the matrix changed my life and

547
00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:43.970
virtually the witch house keys went into multiple layers of my subconscious

548
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.370
and planted that idea to question things.

549
00:28:46.371 --> 00:28:50.660
And that came to define me just like it came to define mall just how it came to

550
00:28:50.661 --> 00:28:53.030
define Fisher at the end of the movie.

551
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:58.010
And so being able to think about the creative process in this kind of

552
00:28:58.011 --> 00:28:59.540
high stakes spy,

553
00:28:59.541 --> 00:29:03.290
like scenario is just so satisfying.

554
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.360
<v 1>Yeah. And that's another thing I was thinking about as well,</v>

555
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.730
was this notion of the Genesis of ideas,

556
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:13.070
where do ideas come from and the complicated way in which most ideas that we

557
00:29:13.071 --> 00:29:13.904
consider,

558
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:18.560
self-generated still relate back to something else are still built on top of

559
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.450
other ideas are the seeds of other things.

560
00:29:20.451 --> 00:29:23.690
And often those things do come from the media. We consume the films,

561
00:29:23.691 --> 00:29:25.460
we're watching the books, we're reading, who we're talking to.

562
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.730
So in that begs a lot of interesting questions and just provides a lot of food

563
00:29:28.731 --> 00:29:32.450
for thought. Really. So now that we have talked about it at multiple levels,

564
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.980
we have to take all of that intricate discussion and reduce everything down to a

565
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:41.060
three option rating system. We have to decide is inception good,

566
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.860
bad or brilliant? Jared, what is.

567
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.280
<v 2>I think it is very good.</v>

568
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.100
I'm not willing to quite give it to brilliant because once again,

569
00:29:50.101 --> 00:29:54.090
I think that the film does buckle under the weight of its own ambition.

570
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:59.010
But that is to say that it swings for the fences and basically hits most of the

571
00:29:59.011 --> 00:30:03.090
marks. I will say that some of the REI nice stuff is a little bit of a bummer.

572
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.740
I think that, um,

573
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:09.930
it's a bummer that it takes an hour to get into the action of the actual heist,

574
00:30:09.931 --> 00:30:11.700
no matter how you cut it. Um,

575
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.070
and I think that although in a lot of heist movies,

576
00:30:14.071 --> 00:30:16.500
the exposition is supposed to be pretty exciting.

577
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.860
This is something that was trying to balance a drama and a heist movie.

578
00:30:19.861 --> 00:30:23.610
So a lot of that first hour isn't as exciting as it is so much an information

579
00:30:23.611 --> 00:30:27.750
dump. So that's the only thing that makes me say that the film isn't, you know,

580
00:30:27.751 --> 00:30:31.590
brilliant or like a masterpiece and it's not my favorite Nolan movie,

581
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.360
but I will say that it's very good.

582
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.300
<v 1>Oh, that was great. Um, I'm going to defer a little bit.</v>

583
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.330
I'm going to say it's like average. Good. Okay. Just straight up. Good.

584
00:30:39.331 --> 00:30:42.990
And for me it is the Ariadne stuff mixed with the fact that I still think parts

585
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.230
of the movie don't make sense and I want it to make more sense than it does.

586
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.180
Maybe that's just me. Uh,

587
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.330
it's something I do want to rewatch I'll I will watch it again,

588
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:54.240
but for me it's just good, but not bad. Similar.

589
00:30:54.241 --> 00:30:56.940
You're just on a little higher end of good than I am, but either way,

590
00:30:56.941 --> 00:31:00.570
I think we both agree that if anyone hasn't seen this movie it's worth the watch

591
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.610
that we watch it. Yeah. Um,

592
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:06.360
so a new thing we're doing is recommending some reading or viewing if someone

593
00:31:06.361 --> 00:31:08.370
was into this movie and just some of the ideas from it,

594
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.040
we'll tell them something to look into. So I can start with you.

595
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.460
Is there anything you think someone that enjoyed the movie and enjoyed this

596
00:31:14.461 --> 00:31:17.040
discussion could read or watch if they wanted to dive in.

597
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.001
<v 2>Little bit deeper? Yeah.</v>

598
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:21.480
So a couple of years ago we did a wisecrack edition on inception and talked

599
00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:24.570
about this, reading about it, being about movies and dreams.

600
00:31:24.571 --> 00:31:28.380
And there's actually a film theorist slash film editor. He, uh,

601
00:31:28.381 --> 00:31:31.440
his name is Walter Merchy edited apocalypse. Now he edited,

602
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.180
I believe the godfather,

603
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.180
he's a very famous editor and he wrote this book called in the blink of an eye

604
00:31:36.181 --> 00:31:39.840
and he has a whole chapter on how the logic of film and the logic of dreams

605
00:31:39.841 --> 00:31:43.020
parallel each other that works really well with how this movie functions.

606
00:31:43.021 --> 00:31:45.510
So in the blink of an eye by Walter merge, I recommend.

607
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.160
<v 1>That's fantastic. Uh, mine is a book, not, not that exciting, I guess,</v>

608
00:31:50.161 --> 00:31:54.720
but if anyone really liked the exploration of memory and the unconscious and

609
00:31:54.721 --> 00:31:58.080
especially the theme of oppression, um, I recommend that you check out Sigmund,

610
00:31:58.081 --> 00:32:01.050
Freud's five lectures on psychoanalysis.

611
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:05.130
And this is one of the series of lectures where Freud gets into the idea of

612
00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:08.430
repression. So I think if you liked the Mol character,

613
00:32:08.431 --> 00:32:12.510
if you liked what was going on inside of Leonardo DiCaprio or Cobb's mind,

614
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.780
it could be a book that you enjoy. Cool. Yeah. Um,

615
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.350
well this has been really fun. Absolutely. Thank you for doing this. Thank you.

616
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.980
Now, normally I would ask where we could find someone, people know where to go.

617
00:32:22.981 --> 00:32:23.940
If they want more Jared in their.

618
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.220
<v 2>Lives, you know, you're already there. This has been.</v>

619
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.620
<v 1>The good, the bad and the brilliant on inception.</v>

620
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.620
Thank you so much for watching. And please let us know in the comments,

621
00:32:31.621 --> 00:32:34.410
if there's other properties you would love to see us cover in the future.

622
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.900
We will see you next time, please guys.

623
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:56.990
