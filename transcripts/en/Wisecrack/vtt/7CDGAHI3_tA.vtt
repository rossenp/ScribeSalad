00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.900
<v 1>Sub wise, crack Jared here. My love for the original matrix is no secret,</v>

2
00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:12.110
but I can't deny that I found the last two films pretty baffling.

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.350
You might've seen our previous videos covering what went wrong with my favorite

4
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:18.260
franchise, but given the announcement of a fourth matrix film,

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.750
I want it to look at the series with fresh eyes.

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.070
This was driven by one specific comment from [inaudible] and a variety article

7
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:26.210
announcing the new installment.

8
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.380
She said many of the ideas Lily and I explored 20 years ago about our reality

9
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.560
are even more relevant. Now, what does she mean by that?

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.420
Is it because robots are stealing?

11
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:39.830
Our jobs are dusters coming back in style is Elon Musk talking about being

12
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.330
trapped in a simulation again,

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.000
while all of these might hold some kernel of truth,

14
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.550
especially the part about how cool dusters are.

15
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.870
We think we figured out what the,

16
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.610
which house sees we're trying to do and why it may resonate today more than ever

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.030
like the title of the rage against the machine song that closes the film.

18
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.040
The original is about waking up.

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.660
<v 1>About seeing past the wool that has been pulled over our eyes of shattering the</v>

21
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:09.650
grand illusion. While it might've been a little obscured by weird rave scenes,

22
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:13.700
we can better understand the latter two films with the question of what's next.

23
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.570
Once we've become awaken to the true reality behind the lies of the world.

24
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
What other dangers lurk behind the red pill? And how does this speak to today?

25
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.630
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on the matrix is real freedom possible.

26
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.350
And as always spoilers ahead for all three matrix films,

27
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.480
but first a very brief recap,

28
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.410
the original matrix follows hacker Neo as he learns that the world is a digital

29
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.160
illusion and that machines have created a vast simulation in order to use

30
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.440
humanity as a renewable energy source.

31
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.230
Neo joins the human resistance in the real world.

32
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.520
And after some self-reflection realizes his destiny as the one,

33
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.720
a prophesied super bad-ass who will use his powers to free humanity from the

34
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:55.490
matrix in the matrix reloaded,

35
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.630
no such liberation has happened because it turns out the one is nothing more

36
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:03.500
than an inevitable anomaly in the system that the machines have planned for.

37
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.423
In other words,

38
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.750
Neo's exceptionalism is just part of the greater project to keep the human race

39
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:10.460
enslaved. At the end of the film,

40
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.390
Neo makes a choice to avoid perpetuating the vicious cycle of human oppression

41
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.960
and risks, the lives of all humans to save his love. Trinity.

42
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.160
He also somehow has powers in the real world. Now in revolutions,

43
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:24.410
we see Neo's choice resulting in the matrix,

44
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.600
deteriorating at the hands of agent Smith.

45
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.370
So he now blinded Neo who can still see something strikes a bargain with the

46
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:32.090
machines.

47
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.470
He will sacrifice himself to destroy agent Smith in exchange for liberating all

48
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:38.570
the humans from the matrix who want to be.

49
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.890
<v 0>What about the others?</v>

50
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.320
What others come on and say what out.

51
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.130
Obviously they will be freed before we get there.

52
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.350
<v 1>The muddled message of the second and third films,</v>

53
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.860
let's revisit one of the most obvious and well-trained interpretations of the

54
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.760
original film in this interpretation Neo's journey from the green tinge and

55
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.860
illusory world of the matrix into the dystopian real world is a version of

56
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.710
Plato's allegory of the cave to summarize a person,

57
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.580
spends their entire life trapped inside a cave where all they see is shadows on

58
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.670
a wall in front of them. But because this is all they've ever known,

59
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.030
they take the shadows to be the one true reality. One day,

60
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.650
that person like Neo is set free to discover the reality behind the shadows for

61
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.130
Play-Doh.

62
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.180
That person was a philosopher and hence would help others free themselves from

63
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.770
the cave. So for Neo, the cave is the matrix and he's led out by Morpheus.

64
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.700
<v 2>You take the blue pill, the story ends.</v>

65
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.060
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

66
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.690
You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland,

67
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.500
and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

68
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.850
<v 1>Techno dystopian than Plato could have ever imagined. But for both Plato's cave,</v>

69
00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:50.910
dweller and Neo the transition to the actual real world,

70
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.280
isn't easy for a lifelong cave. Dweller.

71
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.080
The sun's soak world is blinding for Neo robots are trying to kill him and food

72
00:03:58.081 --> 00:03:58.980
tastes bad.

73
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.970
Plato's allegory of the cave has inspired countless philosophers for thousands

74
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.090
of years, but there's something uniquely timely about it today.

75
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.620
Now more than ever cultural and political movements seem obsessed with stepping

76
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.580
out of the cave of one's imposed ignorance, whether that's using the matrix,

77
00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:19.230
his own red pill as a metaphor for one's awakening or staying woke people with

78
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:23.160
radically different politics frame their movement in terms of pulling back the

79
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:27.300
curtain of social domination. Welcome to the dessert

80
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.120
of the reel in the original film it's hackers that are presented as the brave

81
00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:37.140
souls who are able to use their technical abilities to identify and exploit the

82
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:40.200
digital cracks in their false reality. And while in the nineties,

83
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:43.140
the internet was still in its early stages. You've got mail.

84
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.830
The feeling that the right sub Reddit or Google search can set you free from

85
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:49.770
your ideological shackles has become commonplace.

86
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.280
So if the original matrix film tried to wake us up from our various dream

87
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.710
States, by asking us to question our realities,

88
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.910
how did the sequels try to push this a step further by getting us to wake up

89
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.280
again or in Christopher Nolan's terms?

90
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.850
How can we wake up from a dream that's already taking place within another

91
00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:08.610
dream, besides being pushed into a bathtub of water?

92
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.050
Obviously the matrix reloaded explores the limits of this initial level of

93
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:17.250
wokeness by showing how larger systems of control are often designed to limit

94
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:19.110
our freedom. And in particular,

95
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.730
how these systems can control us via the guise of freedom were first introduced

96
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:25.440
to the central conflict of the film,

97
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.280
the tension between freedom and control during Neo's late night chat with

98
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.570
councilor Hamann about the relationship between seemingly free human beings and

99
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:35.130
seemingly determined machine.

100
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.061
<v 3>No I'm here.</v>

101
00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:39.150
Sometimes I think about all those people still plugged into the matrix.

102
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:40.590
And when I look at this machine,

103
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.920
I can't help thinking that in a way we are plugged into them.

104
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.910
<v 1>While Neo is quick to point out that humans are ultimately in control as they</v>

105
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:54.840
can simply hit the off switch councilor Hamann points out the opposite truth

106
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.490
that if they did turn the machines off,

107
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.830
the residents of Zion would no longer have air or water and they would die.

108
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.900
<v 3>If we control these machines, they don't control us. Of course not.</v>

109
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.100
How could they, the idea is pure nonsense,

110
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.040
but does make one wonder just

111
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.950
what is control.

112
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.240
<v 1>The appearance of absolute human freedom is a thin veil over an underlying</v>

113
00:06:19.241 --> 00:06:20.950
dependence on machines.

114
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.970
This dichotomy goes even further when Neo meets the architect to inform them

115
00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:26.740
that this is actually the sixth time.

116
00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:30.070
He's had a meeting with an iteration of Neo, how is this possible? Well,

117
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:31.990
because Neo isn't as free as he thought,

118
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.550
he's actually a necessary feature of the matrix itself. A systemic anomaly.

119
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.990
<v 4>You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts,</v>

120
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.090
I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical.

121
00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:46.924
Precision.

122
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.130
<v 1>Is a necessary part of the very system he's working to destroy.</v>

123
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.650
This is very heavy in its implications as the,

124
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.130
which Husky seemed to be implying that even after we wake up from the various

125
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.660
illusions and ideologies,

126
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.050
we still might be caught up in a higher level system of control.

127
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.410
And unfortunately Plato's allegory of the cave is of little use here.

128
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.430
Sometimes raging against the machine is exactly what the machine wants.

129
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.570
And if we want to understand why we need to look to philosopher Karl Marx now

130
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:16.750
already the ideas of marks map pretty easily onto the matrix.

131
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.870
Marx argued that society had two fundamental classes,

132
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.300
the workers of the world and the owners of capital,

133
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.170
the people who had the actual factories and machines to make stuff who were in

134
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:29.470
his view, vampires, living off the life force of workers,

135
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.990
tweak this a little bit, and you've got literal machines,

136
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.510
enslaving humans to live off their bodily energy.

137
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.810
While the humans get to dream of eating steak. We should note here that the,

138
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.171
which house,

139
00:07:38.171 --> 00:07:41.530
these thought they were making a movie about the philosophy of John boatyard,

140
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.000
a philosopher who while heavily influenced by Marx greatly diverge from his

141
00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:50.470
ideas in particular boatyard thought that while production Allah Marx's worker

142
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.700
in factory owners was a useful category in analyzing industrial society.

143
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.450
The consumer revolution of the late 20th century made it necessary to shift to

144
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:01.690
the category of consumption to oversimplify.

145
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.430
Modern capitalism is not so much defined by production lines as it is by Disney

146
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:10.210
lines, but they got it kind of wrong. Boatyard himself said that the,

147
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.720
which house skis use of his work stemmed mostly from misunderstandings.

148
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:14.150
He thought the,

149
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.260
which house keys were missing the point in large part because they got trapped

150
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:20.890
in a Marxist line of thinking marks like Plato thought that most people

151
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:23.350
experienced an obscured version of reality,

152
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.610
but marks his word for it was ideology, which gets a lot more complicated,

153
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.653
but importantly,

154
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.230
whereas Baudrillard thought there was no deeper reality behind the spectacle of

155
00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:36.040
modern capitalism, no way to escape our metaphorical matrix.

156
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.320
Mark thought that there was hope for piercing.

157
00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:42.220
The veil Marx thought one of the symptoms of ideology was a kind of upside down

158
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:44.770
world. Whereas many would argue that ideas,

159
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:48.370
politics and culture are things that drive our material. Reality.

160
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.560
Marx argued that it was the reverse.

161
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.400
Our material reality was what determined our ideas, politics,

162
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:58.620
and culture to put it simply if you thought your bosses respect for timeliness

163
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:03.390
and honesty shaped how work was done, you have it backwards. How work is done,

164
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.720
shapes our need for timeliness and honesty for marks,

165
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:10.380
the foundation of a society is formed by relations of labor and production.

166
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.410
That's called the base. So in an industrial society,

167
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:15.510
the base is the production of consumer goods,

168
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:19.470
which requires the distinction between employees and employers or owners and

169
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:21.060
workers in the matrix.

170
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.740
That base is the need to extract energy from human batteries or whatever it is

171
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:28.830
they're trying to build or do the place where ideology rests.

172
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.030
He calls the superstructure. It's composed of things like culture, religion,

173
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.880
politics, and rituals in industrial society.

174
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:40.380
The superstructure helps reinforce base relations like the virtue of hard work,

175
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:43.770
getting you through the day as you monotonously tighten your thousandth nut for

176
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:47.850
the day or in the Canon of this bizarre Powerade commercial you're craving of

177
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:49.560
electrolytes to fuel your robot.

178
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.900
<v 2>The point is to keep generating all that energy.</v>

179
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.390
Your body needs to be replenished.

180
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.840
So drink your Powerade.

181
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.210
We have quotas to meet.

182
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.130
<v 1>Superstructure reproduces itself to perpetuate the base conditions. However,</v>

183
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.730
it's not until the matrix revolutions that Neo is able to fully grasp that the

184
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.980
superstructure is not just the matrix.

185
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.370
If human ideology is dictated by the means of machine production.

186
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.140
So is machine ideology.

187
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.310
He meets three programs in the train station named Rama Chondra Kamala and their

188
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.820
daughter Sati and learns that the war oppresses machines too,

189
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.040
as they're trying to help their daughter, if they delete.

190
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.230
<v 5>I love my daughter very much.</v>

191
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.710
I find it to be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen,

192
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.590
but where we are from that is not enough.

193
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.060
Every program that is created must have a purpose. If it does not,

194
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.260
it is deleted.

195
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.150
<v 1>Therefore the matrix,</v>

196
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.150
isn't just a system in a sense that it's a computer program.

197
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.590
The superstructure births,

198
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.940
the idea that humans and machines must be perpetually at war to ensure that the

199
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:57.890
material base of energy production goes untouched. So in an ideological sense,

200
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.540
that is the matrix.

201
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.750
This brings us back to the tension between freedom and control.

202
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.160
As in Marx's analysis,

203
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:07.910
certain types of freedom are just super structural illusions that enable a

204
00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:11.240
deeper level of control in terms of an economic base.

205
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.220
Remember that Neo's entire existence,

206
00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:16.610
including his role as the one who will lead a rebellion to free humans from

207
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:20.120
machine control is a necessary part of the system itself.

208
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.840
But the matrix argues it is when one thinks they are free from ideology,

209
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.850
that they are most immersed in it.

210
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.540
<v 2>I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you</v>

211
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:34.100
don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you,

212
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.930
a world without rules and controls without borders or boundaries.

213
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.130
<v 1>If we thought Neo threatening his machine overlords and flying off into the sky</v>

214
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.680
as rage against the machine plays was peak rebellion.

215
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.610
We were sorely mistaken and the architect's control room he learns.

216
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.770
He was actually doing precisely what previous versions of his code already done

217
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:56.860
five times previously, what was already pre-planned.

218
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.540
<v 0>The function of the one is now to return to the source,</v>

219
00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:04.290
allowing a temporary dissemination of the code. You carry reinserting,

220
00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:05.310
the prime program.

221
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.500
<v 1>That's precisely what's happening to us when we both consume and produce ideas</v>

222
00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:12.330
and content on digital platforms.

223
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.100
As each time we tweet or repost an article that exposes some societal injustice

224
00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:18.180
or buried knowledge,

225
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.990
we are providing more data for algorithms that are figuring out how to better

226
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:25.560
serve us ads and sell us goods and services. And unlike Neo,

227
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.380
these illusions are taking place right within our own world.

228
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.280
We're even creating our own myths to avoid acknowledging how wrapped up we are

229
00:12:32.281 --> 00:12:35.520
in these systems. For example, the stories about people's devices,

230
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.640
listening to them and serving them ads on Facebook and Instagram.

231
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.940
This is of course false, but the truth is more horrifying,

232
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.720
which is that algorithms have done such a good job of constructing data sets

233
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:49.140
about each of us, that they can accurately predict our desires,

234
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.200
which brings us back to the tension between control and freedom.

235
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.380
Are we really free when we exist in digital spaces?

236
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.100
Or are we just the unknowing cogs in a digital marketing machine?

237
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.990
<v 0>The one was never meant to end anything.</v>

238
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.130
It was all another system of control and why.

239
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.810
<v 1>While Neo's matrix power,</v>

240
00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:10.320
while seeing gold in the third film still doesn't make sense. Maybe the,

241
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.080
which house were trying to go for something like this,

242
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.890
his powers derived from his ability to see behind the final curtain,

243
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.980
the ideology that dictates the human machine war,

244
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.090
the ability to break through an all encompassing ideological system ends up

245
00:13:24.091 --> 00:13:26.880
being more valuable than the ability to Dodge bullets.

246
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.540
And maybe this is why Lana which house he has said that the themes of the matrix

247
00:13:30.541 --> 00:13:35.010
films are more relevant now than ever as we live in a digital culture that is

248
00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:38.610
obsessed with becoming woke to cultural injustice and red pilling,

249
00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:41.400
their way to higher forms of knowledge. But all too often,

250
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.270
this attempt to wake up from the dream is just a higher function of the very

251
00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:47.940
ideological structure. We think we're escaping.

252
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.630
If there's a consistent theme from these films that applies to this contemporary

253
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:52.230
problem,

254
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.790
it seems to be the imperative to constantly interrogate ideological systems.

255
00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.780
With the understanding that the moment we think ourselves free from ideology is

256
00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:03.600
likely when we are the most fully immersed in it.

257
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.260
So will the next matrix introduce us to some new illusion we've been

258
00:14:07.261 --> 00:14:10.860
indoctrinated into? Will it explain some of the shortcomings of the trilogy?

259
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.910
Honestly, I'm just really, really hoping it's good. In the meantime,

260
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.150
we'll be trying our best to remember that even if we don't have sockets in our

261
00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:18.720
spines,

262
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.860
that we might be plugged into ideological power structures without even knowing

263
00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:26.850
it. So good luck in staying awake and as always, thanks for watching guys.

264
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.643
<v 0>Peace</v>

265
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:47.820
[inaudible].
