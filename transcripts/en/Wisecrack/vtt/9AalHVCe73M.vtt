00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>Thanks to Amazon prime video for sponsoring this episode.</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.830
Hey, wisecrack,

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.200
Michael here to talk about our favorite mustachioed reporter for at sag DF,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
between giving you an uncontrollable urge to say my wife and very nice to every

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:21.810
person you see this subsequent movie film created more than a few headlines,

6
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:26.400
about a certain prank on one Rudolph, Giuliani, but political pranking aside,

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.120
I'd like to propose a different way to look at the film as a wholesome,

8
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.680
inspiring fairytale.

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.130
<v 1>Sex attack with me.</v>

10
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.710
If your father was not here.

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.360
<v 0>Well, not Polson anything but wholesome, but a fairytale.</v>

12
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.223
Nonetheless,

13
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.880
welcome to this wisecrack edition on four at subsequent movie film and spoilers

14
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.170
ahead. First,

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.640
a recap after humiliating his native Kazakh stand with his first film or at now

16
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.920
spends his days doing hard labor as punishment.

17
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.900
But after the election of Donald Trump,

18
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.620
the premier of Catholics down is looking for an in with America's head of state,

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.130
which is why he wants to send our disgrace to journalists to America with

20
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:14.180
Kazakhstan's prized possession, Johnny, the monk from there,

21
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.570
let's just say things don't go so well for Johnny

22
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.450
stuck with no monkey and his feral child to tar who definitely didn't eat.

23
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:27.020
Johnny Bora has to improvise a new plan. He will gift to tar,

24
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:28.850
to vice president Michael Pence.

25
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.530
<v 1>Perfect. She will be sexy gift for Michael pants.</v>

26
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.780
<v 0>Beautiful father daughter journey follows that bore at subsequent movie film is</v>

27
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:42.890
a twisted take on traditional fairytales is telegraphed from the beginning.

28
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.360
<v 1>Once upon a time,</v>

29
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.100
there was a lonely passing girl called in Alanya coal country slogan.

30
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.560
<v 0>This cartoon version of Melania Trump,</v>

31
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.580
who must escape her whole country by marrying a rich and powerful man is a

32
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.750
pretty obvious stand-in for your typical Cinderella character who similarly

33
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:03.830
needs to escape her whole home and sisters. Of course, Cinderella.

34
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:06.110
Isn't the only fairy tale with this theme.

35
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.710
Plenty of stories from history shared the basic premise that if you're a woman

36
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.160
and life sucks, Marianne up and everything will be okay.

37
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.680
Well incorrectly called the original Cinderella.

38
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:20.090
There is a story told by the Greek geographer Strabo of a cortison named Rhoda

39
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.560
Fez court is in, by the way,

40
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.190
is a sex worker who services high profile clientele, a fate.

41
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:29.510
She escapes when an Eagle steels or sandal and drops it on the King.

42
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.800
The King who seemingly judge people based on the shape of their feet met and

43
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:34.760
married rotavirus.

44
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.380
This tale of upward mobility via footwear of course shares a key similarity to

45
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:40.070
Cinderella.

46
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.610
Her fairy godmother gives her a sick make-over and sends her off to impress a

47
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:44.870
Prince out of Royal vault.

48
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.680
A glass slipper is lost and the Prince searches for the mysterious woman that

49
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:52.550
wooed him. The point is Cinderella's suit cover days are over.

50
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.380
Once she marries the right guy,

51
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.890
Bourret takes the already fairly depressing premise of Cinderella,

52
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.050
strips it to its core and makes it Oh, so much darker to tar.

53
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.430
Isn't a lowly servant.

54
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.790
She is just a woman from one of the world's most backward countries.

55
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.430
That country being a fictionalized version of [inaudible],

56
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.270
which we will refer to as fake Kazakhstan as the real country does not to my

57
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:15.580
knowledge, let monkeys hold public office.

58
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.070
<v 2>Kazakhstan's minister of culture, a number one porno star.</v>

59
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.380
<v 0>To be true to its fairytale roots.</v>

60
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.580
Bhorat transports us to a land that seemingly hasn't developed since Charles

61
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:30.180
Perot wrote the familiar Cinderella tale in 1,697.

62
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.570
<v 2>Brokers leaped from our dollar skyscraper.</v>

63
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.550
<v 0>And to say that fake Kazakhstan's views on women might be more welcome around</v>

64
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.040
the 17th century is an understatement.

65
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.390
<v 2>But nice [inaudible] because.</v>

66
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.380
<v 0>They're not allowed to have jobs or, you know, do much of anything.</v>

67
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.990
<v 2>This is her ball. Um,</v>

68
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.430
it make her feel safe just like once upon a time,

69
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.180
the strings in her brain might break. If you try to attend church.

70
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.670
So be careful place it's worth noting that.

71
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.260
<v 0>Less extreme version of this outrageous claim was common well into the 20th</v>

72
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:07.830
century.

73
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.850
It was believed even amongst some doctors that if a woman used her brain,

74
00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:16.350
it would divert energy from her womb and thus cause serious harm to her health.

75
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.120
<v 2>Is that Rosie [inaudible].</v>

76
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.230
<v 0>Anyway,</v>

77
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.640
instead of being covered in SU like Cinderella to Tara is covered in hay dirt,

78
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.710
and maybe a little animal manure.

79
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.300
Basically the film is a blast from a past where the science of women's stuff was

80
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:35.880
about as advanced as they flat earthers view of the cosmos.

81
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.200
<v 2>My dad is the smartest person in the whole flat world, but of course.</v>

82
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.160
<v 0>We're adding to target journey out of the past and to modern America,</v>

83
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.120
a land where the story of Cinderella is just a popular Relic from the past,

84
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:52.740
right? Well, yes, sand, no, as the film constantly questions,

85
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:56.820
how America's own modern fairytales might be just as backwards as those of a

86
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:59.310
fake Kazakhstan or 17th century Europe.

87
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.690
Basically Brad wants us to see how America is also a magical land,

88
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:08.190
where a very lucky lady can find a King or a Rudolph Giuliani

89
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.040
that's because two tars journey is of course a modern American Cinderella story.

90
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.170
<v 2>Cinderella TBAs mom. Lamborn.</v>

91
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.840
<v 0>Not only does she get a new wardrobe,</v>

92
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.220
but a fake tan look color is best for a racist family and a haircut that would

93
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:29.790
make dog, the bounty Hunter proud, and burettes twisted fairytale.

94
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.570
The best way for a woman to live a decent life is to drastically alter her

95
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:36.150
appearance until she can attract and marry a rich guy.

96
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.400
Who's preferably on death's door.

97
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.500
<v 3>You like them. That's the question and the end of the debt. Okay.</v>

98
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:46.980
Then you should get someone who just had a heart attack. Yes. Okay. High five.

99
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.473
I love that.

100
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.970
<v 0>I feel like a gross and antiquated narrative,</v>

101
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.470
but it also seems plenty familiar to many of the films targets other relics of a

102
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:55.771
time,

103
00:05:55.771 --> 00:06:00.200
more familiar to Cinderella Prince charming versus today like debutante balls

104
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.160
and centuries past a debutante was literally just a woman who was old enough to

105
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.030
finally marry.

106
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.810
And those balls were basically a way for families to show off their daughters,

107
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:13.010
to eligible bachelors who could, uh, come and get it as it works.

108
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.440
Sandra Jessica Parker drumming.

109
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.080
And while we might say that present day,

110
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.950
debutante balls are about flexing etiquette and father daughter bonding.

111
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.990
We also get comments like this.

112
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.540
<v 2>That's what we'd love. Yeah. In the South pretty girls.</v>

113
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.420
<v 0>Or a guy who jokingly gives to tar. I mean,</v>

114
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.600
Sandra Jessica Parker Drummond a monetary event.

115
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.480
<v 2>How much you think my daughter is worth</v>

116
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.373
$500. Ooh.

117
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.770
<v 0>And he does so right in front of his disgusted child.</v>

118
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.560
<v 2>All roads.</v>

119
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.400
<v 0>Of course, if we want to take refuge in the fact that in America,</v>

120
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.850
women can have jobs go to debutante balls while on their moon blood.

121
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.280
<v 4>You're able to do a lot of things.</v>

122
00:06:57.281 --> 00:07:01.270
Even though we have womanly things that we go through every

123
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.240
moon time you're talking about.

124
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.070
<v 0>No on board wants to constantly explore the boundary of what we find acceptable</v>

125
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:09.820
and why.

126
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.290
So having a come and get it ball for your 15 year old is maybe a okay,

127
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.490
but a blood-soaked fertility dance seems to go too far for polite Southern

128
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:19.240
society.

129
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.410
One dresses up a basic biological reality behind a facade of etiquette and

130
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.650
customs. While one puts that reality right in your face.

131
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.120
Whereas in fake Kazakhstan,

132
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.080
a woman must live in a cage to be financially supported by a man and real

133
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:35.080
America. The cage gets a bit metaphorical.

134
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.070
Women are often implicitly and explicitly encouraged or forced to contort

135
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:42.460
themselves in the quest to find a love slash stability. In this light,

136
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.180
we could consider the words of 18th century philosopher, Mary Wollstonecraft,

137
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.110
also a mother of history's greatest goth who wrote that women are taught from

138
00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:53.110
infancy. That beauty is Herceptin. As a result,

139
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.210
the mind shapes itself to the body and roaming around its guilt cage only seeks

140
00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.440
to adorn its prison.

141
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:01.780
<v 4>As.</v>

142
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.940
<v 0>If living in Walston crafts, gilded cage,</v>

143
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.330
a self-identified sugar baby admits to,

144
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.560
to Tara that for her dreams to come true,

145
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.760
she should remain submissive and also change everything about herself.

146
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.460
And if the message wasn't clear when to tar asks,

147
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:19.420
what she can do for mental liker, her mentor suggest you get a makeover.

148
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.570
<v 4>Face the hair to clothes, to personality.</v>

149
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.590
<v 0>That's right. Even her personality has to go. Not only that,</v>

150
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.320
she's unable to use her God given strength.

151
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.040
<v 4>My is strong. I can open up there with my small hole.</v>

152
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.230
<v 0>And unlike in Walston crafts time,</v>

153
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.350
a woman's Sceptre of beauty can be surgically enhanced.

154
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.000
According to society's demands,

155
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.530
enter plastic surgeons who seem happy to give women their own supposedly ugly

156
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:47.950
duckling story by making them feel bad about their noses.

157
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.820
<v 4>What's real quick. My nose.</v>

158
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.490
<v 0>All in the business of finding Prince charming. I want [inaudible].</v>

159
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.580
<v 2>To be a trend to top level guy.</v>

160
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.040
<v 0>The fictionalization of Kazakhstan's backwardness is really important here</v>

161
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.880
because as the story goes, life in America is a fairy tale.

162
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.460
We're in the land of abundance of equality.

163
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.050
Pizzas with crust made out of breadsticks.

164
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.470
And so on fake Kazakhstan is less a dig at real Kazakh,

165
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:19.430
Stan and more a dig on how some Americans view the rest of the world is some

166
00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:21.080
kind of backwater nightmare,

167
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.550
a faraway land without the magic of castles and fairy godmothers. If you will.

168
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.510
The distress film,

169
00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:30.920
look of the intro with translations over Russian text connects fake Kazak Stan

170
00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:34.640
with the image of a backward Soviet Republic that an American viewer might

171
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.770
conjure up gulags and all.

172
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.610
But when barrette comes to America and finds his worst views, often welcomed,

173
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.850
the viewer has left a question how advanced he really are.

174
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.580
<v 3>Who wants to chop them up like the Saudis dude.</v>

175
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.680
<v 0>But the idea isn't just that bad people do bad things.</v>

176
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:55.670
Although that's certainly a part of it it's that people are convinced to love,

177
00:09:55.671 --> 00:10:00.320
or at least tolerate their cages metaphorical or otherwise, or ad I'd argue,

178
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.820
wants to raise the question.

179
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.270
Defense details have a role in convincing women that it's normal,

180
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.140
even desirable to change your personality and appearance and your search for

181
00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:13.340
love to tar raised on this weird daughters owner manual and the millennia story

182
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.540
begs for a nice cage for her husband to keep her not unlike our sugar baby

183
00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:21.410
expert Tusar has learned how to behave according to social expectations.

184
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.280
Ones that demand submission even weakness from women in search of Prince

185
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:26.180
charming. Of course,

186
00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:29.930
it's not fair to say that women in America are still living in the 19th century

187
00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:32.660
or even pseudo Kazic Stan. And this has played for laughs.

188
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.450
As Borat is surprised that a woman can own a store.

189
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.503
<v 3>[Inaudible] business.</v>

190
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.360
<v 2>Uh, [inaudible] call up Dom</v>

191
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.390
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] truth.

192
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.790
<v 0>Or to target learns that women can drive.</v>

193
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.253
<v 3>They can drive.</v>

194
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.600
<v 0>Unlike the first movie,</v>

195
00:10:56.601 --> 00:11:00.530
subsequent movie film is not only happy to roast people for saying and doing

196
00:11:00.531 --> 00:11:03.380
awful things, but to show that it's not all hopeless,

197
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.640
even our conspiracy theorists pushed back against Borats claim that women can't

198
00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:08.600
think the women, yeah.

199
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.610
<v 2>Here have rights. They can do whatever they want.</v>

200
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.470
They have a brain like we have a brain.

201
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.130
<v 0>Then they wished that their political opponents have less rights than they do.</v>

202
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:21.140
So, uh, we're one for two.

203
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.080
<v 2>They should have a bit less rights than you</v>

204
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.630
say they should.

205
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.170
<v 0>By exploring modern America through the eyes of a disgrace journalist and an</v>

206
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:34.310
idealistic daughter raised on fairytale narratives at subsequent movie film is

207
00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:37.670
able to shine a light on many dark corners of American culture.

208
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.210
If the classic fairytale teaches young women that they'll finally be happy and

209
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:43.580
whole, once they have the adoring gaze of a Prince,

210
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.630
the fairytale we get in this film is one where our heroine realizes her own

211
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.130
self-worth.

212
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.630
<v 3>Betsy go to.</v>

213
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.310
<v 0>So while us and de may have taught the sag Diaz about fashion,</v>

214
00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:00.670
mobile technology goes to.

215
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.880
<v 3>With blue shirt, answer me. You are a.</v>

216
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.040
<v 0>Demon and journalistic integrity.</v>

217
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.900
Maybe the sag Diaz also taught us something about ourselves also to

218
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:14.220
tar, definitely ate Johnny alive. And that's something we all have to live with.

219
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.083
Now, this, all,

220
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.470
this is a big component of subsequent movie film pranks while Sasha Baron Cohen

221
00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:21.900
has been pranking establishment figures for decades.

222
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.500
It's worth understanding the long list of historical pranksters who paved his

223
00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:26.191
way. You know,

224
00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:29.550
people who dumped a bunch of money on wall street and watch people fight each

225
00:12:29.551 --> 00:12:33.300
other for it were the famous comedian who roasted dating shows by appearing in

226
00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:37.860
costume and crying when he lost. So what does Borat have to do with that?

227
00:12:37.861 --> 00:12:39.810
And people's creepy PayPal. Effigies,

228
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.200
you'll have to check it out in our subsequent YouTube video film that we made

229
00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:44.670
featuring yours. Truly.

230
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.600
It gets into some honestly cool history of messing with people it's over at the

231
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.610
