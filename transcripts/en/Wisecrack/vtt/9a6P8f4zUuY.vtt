00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.680
<v 1>Wisecrack Michael here today.</v>

2
00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:09.290
We're looking at a cartoon after our own hearts show,

3
00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:12.710
the combined silver discussions of philosophy with zombie hordes Paris at a

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.640
clown, spiders and magic wielding fishermen. Netflix is the midnight gospel,

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.790
a co-production of comedian Duncan, Trussell and adventure time creator,

6
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:20.690
Pendleton ward,

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.590
the midnight gospel combines audio clips from Trussell's long running podcasts.

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.490
The Duncan Trussell family hour with Ward's signature visual storytelling to

9
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:32.870
create a one of a kind animated series. It is equal parts, trippy, hilarious,

10
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:36.290
and terrifying. But is the show just a compendium of shower,

11
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:38.330
thoughts to help your furlough go down easier?

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.460
Or is it a legitimate dive into quote unquote real philosophy to find out we're

13
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.180
going to focus on one specific aspect of the show. If you've seen it already,

14
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:50.600
you might have noticed one of Trussell's favorite subjects popping up repeatedly.

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.980
<v 2>In Buddhism. The idea is all of those mental, uh, forms.</v>

16
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.810
<v 1>Analysis. Yeah, that's right. Buddhism.</v>

17
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.340
The midnight gospel asks us to consider what are the implications of Buddhist

18
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.040
philosophy for people going about their everyday lives?

19
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.170
Should you become a societal dropout,

20
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:09.980
just like the protagonist Clancy or is there more to life than just micro dosing

21
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:14.300
and doing original magic? Well, we're about to find out, so select your avatars,

22
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:17.690
merged with their simulators and follow us as we rocket into this wisecrack

23
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.760
edition on the midnight gospel, deep or dump as always spoilers ahead.

24
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.130
And now a quick recap,

25
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.700
the plot of the midnight gospel and so far is the show about Yanik multi-verse

26
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:33.440
simulators can be said to have a plot centers on Clancy, a music loving burnout,

27
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:37.280
living in a trailer on the chromatic ribbon on the ribbon Clancy and other

28
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.030
simulation farmers spend their day shoving their heads into the affirmation.

29
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.080
Volvo matrices,

30
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.740
hoping to collect profitable artifacts or marketable experiences from the

31
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:47.480
multi-verse within Clancy.

32
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:50.840
For instance uses his trips to gather content for his pet project,

33
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.270
a space cast with a single subscriber.

34
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.230
<v 2>My one subscriber her not Jensen. I live for you.</v>

35
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.350
You're the reason I wake up in the morning with a smile on my face.

36
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.730
<v 1>Clancy space.</v>

37
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.880
CAS takes the form of interviews with subjects from wacky dine worlds,

38
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.970
usually centered around topics such as Eastern philosophy,

39
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.060
the occult or anything else worthy of a Keanu Reeves

40
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.700
said conversations use repurposed audio from Trussell's actual interviews with

41
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.600
people like Dr. Drew Pinsky and Anne Lamott from the beginning Clancy

42
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:24.620
prioritizes thinking about and discussing these big ideas over more practical

43
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:25.220
concerns,

44
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.490
such as problems in his personal life or the day-to-day operations of his

45
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:32.870
simulator on an admittedly simulated planet, overrun by zombies. For instance,

46
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.720
he is so unconcerned with what's going on around him,

47
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.530
that he continues to talk about the positive benefits of mindfulness meditation.

48
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.350
While the man is eaten alive in front of his pregnant wife.

49
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.831
<v 2>They say,</v>

50
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:45.830
look at it as though you're sitting in a forest and you're getting to watch a

51
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:50.030
rare animal walking out and the clearing.

52
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.920
<v 1>Clancy avoids mundane tasks like reading the instruction manual for your</v>

53
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.763
simulator,

54
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.380
dismissing them as distractions from his contemplation of the deeper truths of

55
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:00.190
existence.

56
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.810
<v 3>Good morning, master, did you get a chance to read the universe simulator FAQ?</v>

57
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.550
I left in your inbox. Nope.

58
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.560
<v 1>Specifically Clancy through his passing familiarity with Eastern religious</v>

59
00:03:10.561 --> 00:03:15.120
traditions has come to believe that the material world is unimportant or even

60
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.980
illusion.

61
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.250
<v 2>And then you become pure awareness.</v>

62
00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:22.200
And the concept is that is what we really are in that this entire material

63
00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:26.910
universe, including our body is kind of [inaudible].

64
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.620
I can't say it. And now I'm in a logical phenomenological field of phenomena.

65
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.200
I feel the phenomenon being encapsulated within.

66
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.300
<v 1>Simply Clancy is saying the tangible universe that we can see, hear touch,</v>

67
00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:44.070
et cetera, is just an imperfect manifestation of a more fundamental reality,

68
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.210
accessible through consciousness, altering practices like meditation, ritual,

69
00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:49.560
plants, medicine, and so on.

70
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.180
Therefore the material world can and ought to be ignored avoided,

71
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:57.810
or ideally transcended everyday life with its bills,

72
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.550
neighbors and absurd laws.

73
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.300
Isn't the full experience of divinity enlightenment or whatever you want to call

74
00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:05.310
it. Therefore it's crap.

75
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.450
So here's the question are Clancy's thoughts on Eastern religious philosophy

76
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:13.800
deep or more like the inane ramblings of someone who just escaped their first

77
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.700
Allen watch YouTube rabbit hole to answer that question and we need to ask,

78
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.480
does Clancy's line of reasoning fit within a Buddhist context that is,

79
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.800
do his beliefs hold water among Buddhist philosophers with a smidge more

80
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:28.290
experience? Well, yes and no.

81
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.380
Let's start with the idea that the world is unimportant and illusory.

82
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.440
According to the Dalai Lama, this is somewhat correct,

83
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.370
but only half the picture when it comes to living by the tenants of Buddhism in

84
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:39.151
mind science,

85
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:43.200
a collection of essays and dialogues the Dalai Lama contends that there are two

86
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:45.750
levels of truth in the Buddhist worldview. One,

87
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.200
an ultimate truth subscribed to by Clancy and your stoner roommate,

88
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.940
which acknowledges the emptiness of and impermanence among all things and to a

89
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:54.960
relative truth.

90
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.440
Having to do with the facts of existence as they relate to our daily lives,

91
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.010
both of these truths are equally important to living a good life.

92
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.710
At least within the particular version of Tibetan Buddhism,

93
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:08.550
the Dalai Lama represents the relative world with all its disappointments

94
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.110
frustrations and heartaches is not merely some illusion to be seen through.

95
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.340
This is Contra Clancy who tries to sidestep the problems of the material world

96
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:20.550
by fleeing to some supposedly higher plane of existence.

97
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.100
The Dalai Lama accepts the reality,

98
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:25.680
not only of the subjective world of the mind,

99
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.090
but also of the external objects of the physical world. In other words,

100
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:33.930
while the mind blowing cosmic insights gained through meditation and or study in

101
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:37.950
the Buddhist tradition are all well and good. They are not an excuse to golf,

102
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:40.860
to a trailer somewhere and abandoned one's responsibilities,

103
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.850
which is what Clancy has decided to do as his computer points out to him.

104
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.280
<v 3>Master it's become clear to me that you've been</v>

105
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.510
doing mini my life.

106
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.460
<v 1>If the show were merely to stop here,</v>

107
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.090
we'd be forced to call dumb on this delightfully bizarre series.

108
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.560
Getting half of Buddhism right at the expense of the other half is not in

109
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.490
philosophical terms. Cool, but this show doesn't stop there.

110
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.630
Instead it explores how the pure universal truth approach to life does not

111
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:11.060
qualify as enlightenment. On the contrary,

112
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:15.920
it creates very real harm throughout much of the series Clancy's distain for the

113
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:19.790
material world keeps coming back to bite him in the early on.

114
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.370
We learned that Clancy's dismissive attitude towards humdrum.

115
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:25.970
Everyday life has begun to affect his relationships. For instance,

116
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.930
he is funding his face cast ambitions with money borrowed from his sister who

117
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.860
explicitly told him not to blow it on a multi-verse simulator is that.

118
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.990
<v 2>I stare out at this majestic scene. I can't help,</v>

119
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.720
but think of my sister, Sarah,

120
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.060
he said, Nancy, I'll loan you this money,

121
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.740
but you have this time is not to spend it on a youth universe emulator.

122
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.760
<v 1>Where's her attempts to call him, which rightfully her off.</v>

123
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.200
<v 4>Clancy. It's your sister. You need to call me back right now.</v>

124
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.070
P doc, man. There's no reason that your face.

125
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.570
<v 1>Or by repeatedly ignoring his computer's request for basic maintenance.</v>

126
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.740
He winds up damaging.

127
00:07:08.741 --> 00:07:12.790
Most of the world's in a simulator before he even gets the chance to visit them.

128
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.210
<v 4>Due to operator error. There are no longer living things on this planet.</v>

129
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.703
<v 2>What about this one?</v>

130
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.300
<v 1>Avoidance doesn't help Clancy transcend the very real problems of his busted</v>

131
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:26.800
computer broken family ties and a weak space cast in search of the ultimate

132
00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:27.310
truth.

133
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.690
Clancy has forgotten the relative truths and nuisances of everyday existence,

134
00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:36.070
which no matter how much Iowasca you chug have a funny way of hanging around

135
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:38.290
until you actually do something about them.

136
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.840
When Clancy's sister finally gets through to him,

137
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.490
she explains that she doesn't even care about the money.

138
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.890
<v 4>I love you. And if this is about the money, you don't need to pay me back.</v>

139
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.120
<v 1>She's just worried about her brother and how his refusal to face up to his role</v>

140
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:53.200
in the world is hurting him.

141
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.520
This confrontation with the real world puts an unprepared Clancy and a full-on

142
00:07:57.521 --> 00:07:58.600
sweaty panic attack,

143
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.620
which he follows with an angry outburst against the one person who cares enough

144
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:03.520
to check up on him.

145
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.980
<v 2>Voicemail message, not received. Clearly.</v>

146
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.640
<v 1>Lancey isn't finding lasting peace and happiness from taking refuge in the</v>

147
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:16.750
platitudes around ultimate truth, favored by hermits Bernie Mann, attendees,

148
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:20.830
and Jetta to achieve what we might call real enlightenment within a Buddhist

149
00:08:20.831 --> 00:08:23.140
framework, sentience beings like Clancy,

150
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:27.340
and like us also have to come to terms with the painful sometimes downright

151
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:30.580
nasty facts of physical existence. And to do that,

152
00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:34.300
we need to look at zombies no seriously in his book,

153
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:35.800
Dharma of the dead scholar,

154
00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:39.550
Christopher M Mormon explore some of the parallels between zombie fiction and

155
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:42.580
Buddhism particularly important for our purposes.

156
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.780
He demonstrates how your typical glass eyes zombie wandering around in a stupor

157
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:50.800
can serve as a model for one of the potential pitfalls of meditation practice,

158
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.410
the deliberate cultivation of a pleasantly numb translate state of being devoid

159
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.470
of mindful attention, fictional zombies. In other words,

160
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.370
can represent one of the very real dangers of sloppy or misdirected

161
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.204
spirituality.

162
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.230
Zombies can be a metaphor for those practitioners of a given tradition who try

163
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.220
their damnedest to paper over the difficulties of relative existence with

164
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.970
ultimate truths about God, the universe, or whatever else is in that pamphlet.

165
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.730
They're shoving at your face from the Dalai Lama's point of view.

166
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.200
And this kind of zombie Zen existence would seem to stand in stark contrast to

167
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.730
the real goal of meditation.

168
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.970
Cultivating a moment to moment engagement with the present.

169
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.320
Also known as mindfulness in describing the difference between helpful practice

170
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.140
and self-imposed Zomba vacation Mormon also notes,

171
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:37.800
a parallel between core tenants of Buddhism and philosopher Martin Heidegger's

172
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:42.000
concept of design design is Heidegger's term for the uniquely human experience

173
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:45.660
of existence in describing the parallels between this thinking in Buddhism.

174
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.060
Mormon contends that according to Heidegger,

175
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.260
the authentic self is that which acknowledges its own mortality and incorporates

176
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:52.680
it.

177
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.210
The inauthentic self is one that denies death and fleas it here design sounds of

178
00:09:57.211 --> 00:10:00.540
much like the Buddhist and not a different perspective on selfhood that

179
00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:02.550
acknowledges the truth of its impermanence.

180
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.950
So what does that mean for our favorite space?

181
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.450
Castor put simply Clancy can laser focus on the ultimate truth.

182
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.080
Rhapsodize about phenomenological field and be a Dick to his sister,

183
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:14.280
as much as he pleases,

184
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.240
but doing those things will not help him become an authentic self like everyone

185
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.690
else in the universe, Clancy is in a nada, a not self,

186
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.070
which is to say a being subject to change, including discomfort and eventual.

187
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:27.570
Non-existence authentic.

188
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:31.260
Living follows not from a narrow emphasis on the wonderful things in life,

189
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.150
its beauty and pattern for instance,

190
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.040
but from an ongoing acceptance and integration of it, fear aspects such as pain,

191
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.270
violence, and death,

192
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.620
which is not to say that Buddhism is all doom and gloom far from it through his

193
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:44.610
interview subjects,

194
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.480
Clancy comes to realize that a worldview which integrates both a love of life

195
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.110
and a deep awareness of death is the gateway to a precious mode of being,

196
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:55.830
which he could never access through his space cast alone. In other words,

197
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.150
he starts to care about the world outside his simulator as a valuable part of

198
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:03.330
existence in and of itself over the course of his journey,

199
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:07.470
he comes to accept the at first glance contradictory notion that struggling with

200
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:09.750
life's hardships can bring immense pain,

201
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.740
but can also bring a profound piece that isn't so affected by the ups and downs

202
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:15.480
of the multi-verse. For example,

203
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.470
during one of Trussell slash Clancy's podcast interviews, Buddhist teacher,

204
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:22.100
Trudy Goodman rides through a graveyard while explaining.

205
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.580
<v 5>Time of death is uncertain. But death is certain.</v>

206
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.190
If we really got that,

207
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.050
we would have fewer of the kind of moments where we regret having wasted

208
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.170
our time or somebody else's. And it's so precious.

209
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:40.970
And just as horrible brutal as the world can be. It's gorgeous and exquisite.

210
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.250
<v 1>I mean, it really hits home for Clancy.</v>

211
00:11:43.251 --> 00:11:46.880
When the multi-verse simulator brings him in contact with his mother voiced by

212
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:48.290
Duncan Trussell's real life.

213
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:52.880
Mom Deneen fended who passed away of cancer in 2013 as part of a

214
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.320
scene in which Clancy and his mom undergo a full life,

215
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.010
death and rebirth together. Deneen explains how she's holding up so well,

216
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.420
despite her diagnosis.

217
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.930
<v 6>Look better now than I ever have is because I am more fully living,</v>

218
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.420
right? Because I'm living and dying consciously, simultaneously,

219
00:12:12.421 --> 00:12:13.320
I'm holding both.

220
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.610
<v 1>In a similar way.</v>

221
00:12:14.611 --> 00:12:18.900
Clancy finally arrives at a degree of authenticity by dropping his pretensions

222
00:12:18.901 --> 00:12:22.110
and learning to engage in his own life mess and all.

223
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.740
<v 6>Even though your life is out of tune,</v>

224
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:31.230
you can still sing along with it and it's better to

225
00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:36.090
be you and out of tune than acting like someone else

226
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.010
too is found in life, man.

227
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.190
<v 1>So put it another way. Clancy learns to embody both the ultimate truth.</v>

228
00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:48.180
He's so stoked about and the relative truth that the Dalai Lama or Heidegger

229
00:12:48.181 --> 00:12:50.460
would argue is so vital to human existence.

230
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.700
We see his new awareness play out in the final moments of the series.

231
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.840
When a radon Clancy's unlicensed simulation farm ends with Clancy and his dog

232
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.680
diving all the way into the simulator to escape the FET moments later,

233
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:03.150
Clancy winds up on a bus,

234
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.300
surrounded by the people he's interviewed throughout the series.

235
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.260
This is a situation that ultimate truth Clancy could dissect for hours.

236
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.800
Is this the afterlife? Is he still in the simulator?

237
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.340
What the ever-loving is going on with the driver playing the spoons.

238
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:22.170
But instead we see Clancy experience a real moment of awareness and

239
00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:22.950
clarity.

240
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.120
After walking to the back of the bus Clancy half-heartedly starts to interview a

241
00:13:27.121 --> 00:13:28.140
stranger. You mind.

242
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.093
<v 6>Am I dead.</v>

243
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.120
<v 1>Only to realize that something way more important than the space cast is</v>

244
00:13:36.121 --> 00:13:39.900
happening right in front of him. The man in the robe turns out to be rom Doss,

245
00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:41.910
a practitioner of Eastern meditation techniques,

246
00:13:41.911 --> 00:13:45.690
and one of Trussell's heroes who answers Clancy's questions by saying,

247
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.870
just be here. In other words,

248
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.190
Clancy rides off into eternity with the knowledge that a more specific answer to

249
00:13:53.191 --> 00:13:53.940
his question,

250
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.990
doesn't really matter if and when the bus reaches its final destination,

251
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.200
whatever's waiting at the end can take care of itself.

252
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.460
What's really important right now is focusing his attention on every precious

253
00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:09.330
moment. And that seems way closer to whatever real enlightenment looks like,

254
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.340
which is why graveyard penis not withstanding the series earns a solid

255
00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:16.980
deep from us. So what do you think wisecrack?

256
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.820
And we oversold this cookie cartoon or is it even more brilliant than we're

257
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:21.690
giving it credit for it?
