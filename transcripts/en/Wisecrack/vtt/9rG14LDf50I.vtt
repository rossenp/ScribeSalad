<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.070
<v 1>Guys, Jared, here with another blog.</v>

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.480
Have you ever sensed that a movie video game or TV show was deliberately

4
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.360
punishing you by making you the butt of the joke?

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.590
Has it ever felt like an artist's work amounted to a big old Loogi in your face?

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.850
And have you ever actually.

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.090
<v 0>I really enjoyed it. Thank you, sir.</v>

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.550
<v 1>A particularly ballsy creator to troll their own audience and a particularly</v>

9
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:30.260
talented one to pull it off,

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.100
whether it's the Cohen brothers robbing us of a satisfying ending or South

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.001
parks, Trey Parker,

12
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.540
making us sit through a Halloween special that he knew only he would like.

13
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.220
<v 0>Did everyone enjoy the Halloween special? No, Randy only you did.</v>

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.820
Oh, well that was pretty much my target audience.

15
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.290
<v 1>There seems to be a certain kind of creator who derives joy from trolling their</v>

16
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:55.880
audience sometimes just for the LOLs. And sometimes to make a profound point,

17
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.610
I've always been pretty captivated by the sheer gall.

18
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:01.220
It takes to purposely disappoint your viewers,

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.420
but there's one particular example of trolling in film. That's so audacious.

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.590
So legendary.

21
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.420
So utterly fascinating that it left me with my mouth agape after I saw it.

22
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.740
And I thought it deserved a closer look. So join me in this wisecrack blog.

23
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:19.160
As I detailed my pick for the greatest troll in cinema history.

24
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.410
<v 0>And.</v>

25
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.330
<v 1>As always spoilers ahead,</v>

26
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.310
before we can discuss what constitutes a truly excellent troll,

27
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.120
we first need to establish what does it even mean to troll your audience?

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.110
In this context,

29
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:37.040
trolling broadly means deliberately angering someone to get a reaction from

30
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.690
them. For the purposes of this video,

31
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:40.880
I'm using the word to refer to that experience.

32
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.480
When a piece of media builds a certain understanding between creator and

33
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:49.100
audience only to aggressively undercut that understanding with full knowledge

34
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:52.250
that doing so will upset the viewer. For example,

35
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:56.030
consider the legendary release of metal gear solid to for years,

36
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:59.750
fans were teased with images that implied we'd be playing as the franchise's

37
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:03.740
beloved hero, turns out an hour into the game, solid snake soft,

38
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.290
and you have to play the rest of the game as some rando,

39
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.200
but all the world's media trolling seems utterly banal.

40
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:13.070
When compared to that of the 1999, Japanese film, dead or alive,

41
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.700
directed by Takashi meet gay. If you haven't seen it. No worries.

42
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.570
I'll fill in the details. Now Takashi Mika is in my opinion,

43
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:24.200
something of an ecentric genius. He makes multiple movies a year,

44
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.790
sometimes as many as five while straddling vastly different genres and

45
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:33.110
tones. He's made everything from Ninja action movies to fantasy dramas,

46
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.930
to surreal gangster flicks, to kids' movies,

47
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.520
to some of the most uncategorizable inexplicably, bizarre you've ever seen.

48
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.510
He's always pushing boundaries and refuses to let anything get in the way of him

49
00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:46.850
making an exciting movie, even the script,

50
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.610
which he has been known to elaborate on substantially.

51
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.360
So how exactly does Mika troll his audience for context?

52
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.580
Here's a brief recap of dead or alive.

53
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.320
The film depicts two tortured souls caught in the midst of a power dispute

54
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.860
between the triads and the Yakuza in Japan Shinjuku district.

55
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.500
Our protagonists are Joe Jima and Ryo ichi.

56
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.370
Joe Gemma is a policeman who is forced to do business with criminals in order to

57
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.640
fund an emergency medical procedure for his daughter, Ryan Ricci,

58
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.840
born to Japanese parents in China is a Hitman who uses blood money to send his

59
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.980
little brother Tojo to an American college. But despite their sacrifices,

60
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.550
Joe Juma and Riley cheek can't seem to hold their families together.

61
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.000
Despite [inaudible] efforts to keep him from a life of violence.

62
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.820
Togi is tragically killed in a gunfight.

63
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.010
Similarly Joe Gemma's efforts and poorly,

64
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.410
even after he acquires the money for the procedure,

65
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.190
his family dynamic remains strained their tragic fates collide.

66
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:42.790
When Ryan beachy discovers that Joe Gemma is awarding his plans to take over

67
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:47.470
drug shipments from Taiwan, Ryan leechy then kills Joe Gemma's entire family.

68
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.430
The movie ends with the familiar gangster film scenario,

69
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.520
a standoff between two men with nothing to lose.

70
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.780
How will this tragic cycle of violence end for these two bereaved family men

71
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.500
glad you asked Joe Gemma holds a bazooka out of his back

72
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.020
And Riley leechy pulls a glowing orb out of his chest.

73
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.300
<v 0>The two projectiles.</v>

74
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.120
<v 1>Collide and the earth explodes VN.</v>

75
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.060
What just happened?

76
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.380
The audience has spent nearly two hours investing in these characters,

77
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.830
identifying what their struggles and engaging with the moral ambiguity is at

78
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:30.780
play only for the movie to at the last minute change genres entirely

79
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:34.680
and descend into trippy Saifai craziness for comparison.

80
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.100
Imagine if at the end of Titanic, right as Rose lets go of Jack,

81
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.540
he turns into a lizard person,

82
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.800
eats her and throws the Titanic into the sun and ending that broke the tone.

83
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:47.280
So thoroughly would kind of ruin all that King of the world stuff. Right?

84
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.530
When I saw this movie for the first time,

85
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:52.620
I felt like the joke was on me for caring about the story.

86
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.190
So what in the world is going on here? Is it just pure nihilism,

87
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.880
a devious filmmaker getting his rocks off by pulling the rug out from under his

88
00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:03.420
audience? Or is there something deeper at play to figure this out?

89
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:06.210
We're going to have to take a close look at the rest of the film.

90
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.160
First I have to mention the intro.

91
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.790
It would be misleading for me to see that the entire film is devoid of us.

92
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.630
And tricities because the first eight minutes are also totally bonkers though,

93
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:20.010
in a way that stays firmly rooted in the modern Yakuza film sub genre to say

94
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:22.860
it's not YouTube friendly is an absurd understatement.

95
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.850
It's eight minutes of exhilarating, no holds barred, brutally tasteless,

96
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:31.710
deranged, excess sex, strippers, hard drugs, binge eating murder,

97
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.330
all in highly stylized hyperkinetic editing set to heavy rock and roll.

98
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

99
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.910
<v 1>It's generally some of the most violent into praise stuff you've ever seen me.</v>

100
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:49.200
Gay claims that this intro was initially comprised of a whopping 20 separate

101
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:53.670
establishing scenes that he decided to condense into a single wild one as

102
00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:54.031
writers,

103
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:57.650
Rob Daniel and Dave would explain in their essay from the anthology Bureau

104
00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:00.290
without frontiers horror cinema across the globe.

105
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.570
This choice importantly demonstrates his belief that a film script is merely the

106
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:06.470
starting point.

107
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.300
But after that whiplash of pure sleaze that are alive slows way,

108
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:15.710
the hell down and proceeds to conform to all the genre conventions of a typical

109
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.280
gangster film. This continues for the vast majority of its runtime.

110
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.540
The scenes are typically grounded in realism, family dynamics and emotion,

111
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.950
the film transitions to lethargic wide shots and introspective meditations on

112
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:28.910
the nature of evil.

113
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.243
<v 0>But unsafe.</v>

114
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.550
<v 1>Sequences. The camera goes handheld for a more immersive feel,</v>

115
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.270
but unlike the intro or the ending, it remains grounded in realism.

116
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.201
For the most part,

117
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:48.310
the film leans heavily into what Daniel and would describe as the philosophical

118
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.700
and introspective calm of traditional Japanese filmmaking,

119
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.120
a kind of calm that makes the ending all the more out of place,

120
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.640
but we'll get to that what's more dead or alive.

121
00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:01.090
Presents us with a number of moral ambiguity is common to the genre.

122
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.960
Joe Gemma's need to engage in criminal activity to afford his daughter's surgery

123
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.020
and Riley cheese violence enabling his brother's education.

124
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.800
It also explores cultural issues, specifically the plight of the Zen,

125
00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:16.490
where you Koji or people of Japanese parentage born in China after world war II,

126
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.010
Riley chia and his gang are strangers in a strange land seeking roots and an

127
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:24.490
identity in the midst of a gang war between the Japanese and the Chinese,

128
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.180
neither of which accept them. But despite all this effective,

129
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.920
if standard Yakuza movie fare every once in a while for very brief moments,

130
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.300
the film breaks genre conventions and goes a little haywire and it's in those

131
00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:41.350
moments that could clue us in to what the ending may signify periodically.

132
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:44.860
We'll witness scenes dramatize in a bland traditional manner,

133
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.810
perhaps even redundantly. So only to spontaneously erupt into hyper violence.

134
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.790
That explosion seemed a bit over the top. No,

135
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.640
likewise from [inaudible] kills the triad and your cous, uh,

136
00:08:03.641 --> 00:08:07.930
leaders and entire act of traditional filmmaking is upset when the editing style

137
00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:10.780
and level of violence reverts back to the style of the intro.

138
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.070
Sometimes these explosions of access or funny other times disturbing and other

139
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:17.500
times make for bizarre moments of levity.

140
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.150
This tendency to indulge in bizarre rhythmic switches from banal to extremely

141
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:23.160
comedic racist.

142
00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:27.010
The question is this whole film and elaborately constructed dark comedy.

143
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.430
And if so, what's the joke. Let's go back to the ending,

144
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:34.150
which aside from the world blowing up also involves a guy jumping at Joe Gemma's

145
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:35.440
car with a grenade in his hand,

146
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.160
causing it to inexplicably explode hundreds of feet in the air.

147
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.110
Joe Gemma of course survives this.

148
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.920
Somehow the original ending written in the script featured our two protagonists

149
00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:48.370
meeting in Taiwan where they would have a final dramatic shootout.

150
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.090
And ultimately the audience wouldn't know who won this ending.

151
00:08:52.091 --> 00:08:54.790
Presumably didn't excite me K. So he changed it,

152
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.950
but it's worth asking what a slow motion shootout be any more meaningful than

153
00:08:58.951 --> 00:08:59.880
the ending we got,

154
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.840
whether it's two bodies lying dead in the street or the entire planet exploding

155
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.740
either way.

156
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.790
The narrative device that brings the film to a close is like most films of the

157
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:13.230
Yakuza genre violence. Now consider the central plot points.

158
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.950
[inaudible] brother dies in a gunfight and Joe Gemma's family has killed as

159
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.180
collateral damage for his meddling and Ryo cheese affairs is this bizarre ending

160
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:25.050
commenting on the violence that dominates the genre of Yakuza movies that

161
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:27.090
violence just begets more violence.

162
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.080
Perhaps Mika is criticizing the enormously popular gangster film genre,

163
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.600
or by first inhabiting it and then perverting it,

164
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.780
it takes the supposition that violence is in itself,

165
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.830
a meaningful way to end the movie and draws it out to its logical conclusion.

166
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.610
That's such violent ways of life have potentially negative implications on the

167
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:46.440
whole world. Of course,

168
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.070
it'd be remiss of me not to mention how absolutely hilarious this moment is.

169
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:54.000
After the initial shock wears off as if the film is making fun of the ambiguous.

170
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:58.710
Everybody dies conclusion by intensifying it to an utterly insane degree.

171
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.190
Now it's worth noting that Mika has made a number of Yakuza films,

172
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.800
not all of which have this arguably critical edge.

173
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.640
So it's also possible that this improvised ending is more result of boredom with

174
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:12.480
the genre than disdain for it. There are many other ways to theorize.

175
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:16.200
This ending may be me K's railing against the restrictions that any genre film

176
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:18.330
imposes on the audience's expectations.

177
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.900
Perhaps the ending is a wake-up call for gangster film fans to engage more

178
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:23.520
critically with the subject matter.

179
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.330
Or maybe this abrasive change in tone is more commentary on the limitations

180
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:30.480
faced by directors when making genre films, limitations,

181
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.680
which can stifle them with narrowly defined tropes and conventions either way.

182
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.920
I don't think this troll fits under the category of purely spitting in the

183
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:41.130
audience's face as taken aback as I was by the ending.

184
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.600
This bizarro turn is decisively as thought provoking as it is hilarious,

185
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.430
but I'm curious to hear what you guys think.

186
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.570
Does the movie draw the audience in with common images of the Yakuza film genre

187
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.410
only to punish us for being seduced by something so trite and excessively

188
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:56.070
violent?

189
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.630
Is it depriving us of the satisfying sensical ending we perhaps wanted or asking

190
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:05.190
us if such an ending would really make any more sense or is this Epic troll

191
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.360
purely nihilistic.

192
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.110
And can you think of any examples of truly cinema that outdo Mika?

193
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.000
