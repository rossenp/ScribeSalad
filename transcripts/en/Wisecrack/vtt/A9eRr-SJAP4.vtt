00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.730
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.230
<v 1>What's up guys, Jared here,</v>

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.570
the name Sterling Archer brings to mind a few glorious. If disturbing images,

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.860
whizzing bullets that rarely hit anything bloody Mary's for breakfast and an

5
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:19.100
adult secret agent with a category four edible complex.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.010
<v 0>My head hurts and I have no father, but what if.</v>

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.760
<v 1>Paying attention to who raised Archer could give us greater insights into some</v>

8
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:27.350
of his more unique quirks?

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.100
<v 0>Well, sit here, dress like some sort of capital rapist.</v>

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.710
<v 1>No, not his mom. Have you seen the show?</v>

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.280
We mean the reliable friend who guided him through his most formative years.

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.210
That's right. The glowing screen of parental guidance and cultural formation,

13
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.100
the TV, because it may be Archer's profound bond with 1980 cinema and TV.

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.600
<v 0>I no longer wish to be represented by TVs. Michael Gray can help us.</v>

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.620
<v 1>I understand his inability to form healthy bonds with human beings. Now,</v>

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.700
most American kids put in a solid amount of time in front of the magical box of

17
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:02.450
wonders, but ideally it serves as a source of entertainment,

18
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.550
not as a stand in for, you know, necessary human interactions.

19
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.790
So if we want to understand what makes Archer so archery,

20
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.420
we need to look at how his childhood consumption of film and television turned

21
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:16.880
him into the sort of adult who thinks this is normal.

22
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.600
<v 0>I don't care Pam. Now having said that,</v>

23
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.510
would you please come in this dirty toilet stall and have sex with me?

24
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.500
<v 1>So let's find out how being raised on screen can seriously screw a person up in</v>

25
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.330
this wisecrack edition on Archer,

26
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.040
raised by TV and as always spoilers ahead. But before we jump in,

27
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:37.670
I want to take a second to remind you to check your voter registration status.

28
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.860
This week, we're partnering with global citizen,

29

If you haven't checked out your registration status since 2016 now is the time

32
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:52.940

37
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.250
And now back to the show in case you've been on the Archer family,

38
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:14.000
liquid diet and forgot what the show is about a quick refresher archers for

39
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.630
seven seasons take place in a vaguely cold war S timeline, uh,

40
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.880
shares all of our pop culture points of reference.

41
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.610
<v 0>Garate the Dane cook of martial arts.</v>

42
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.240
<v 1>Playing fast and loose with everything else. Archer who works for his mother,</v>

43
00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:31.010
Mallory is a top tier international spy with a pension for booze Lee bungling

44
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:34.940
missions. Oh, also for the past few seasons, he's been in a lifeless coma,

45
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.030
but the show goes on inside his bizarre unconscious,

46
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:42.410
as he dreams up new adventures for his team set everywhere from 1940s LA to

47
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.410
outer space. As we see through flashbacks in the series,

48
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.250
Archer's childhood was not great. His mom abandoned him as a baby,

49
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.930
leaving him under the care of a stiff British Butler and heroin addict Woodhouse

50
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.890
upon her return.

51
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:58.910
His mother makes up for lost time by moving houses and accidentally forgetting

52
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.100
to Archer. Just.

53
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.300
<v 0>Like that Christmas break.</v>

54
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:05.110
When I moved and forgot to give my new address to his stupid boarding school.

55
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.920
<v 1>She also steals a spike to teach him a lesson.</v>

56
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.180
<v 0>Stole my bike. I came home from work and it was just lying on the sidewalk.</v>

57
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:14.100
And I thought, Oh, well, this will teach him.

58
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.120
<v 1>Beats him with a paddle.</v>

59
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:19.290
When he cries and turns him into a full fledged gambling addict and alcoholic

60
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.040
before he loses all his baby teeth, real mother of the year stuff.

61
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.430
<v 0>My mom had told me how much she loved me all the time. Exactly.</v>

62
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.570
Look how you turned out.

63
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.200
<v 1>We don't know much else about his childhood, but none of it seemed great.</v>

64
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.130
He once spent five weeks in the hospital after getting a hardcore prep school

65
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.241
swirly. However,

66
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:39.780
we do know that Archer's childhood hero was none other than the pride of Florida

67
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:41.490
state university, Burt Reynolds.

68
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.240
This suggests that Archer was busy forming attachments to the people on his TV

69
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:45.900
screen.

70
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.540
<v 0>Well then we better keep Dr. Bellows away from genie. No.</v>

71
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.550
<v 1>While his mom was out doing spy stuff and his caretaker was in doing heroin</v>

72
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:57.540
stuff while we don't actually see Archer watching TV, the pop culture,

73
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:01.560
he absorbed as a kid, clearly functions as a crucial layer of his character.

74
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.100
<v 0>We know they're building a Gundam suit with bazookas for ham.</v>

75
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.720
<v 1>And being raised by television puts Archer right at home in modern culture where</v>

76
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:14.010
kids between two and five spend about 32 hours a week watching the boob tube.

77
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.031
Coincidentally,

78
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:18.240
that's also how much time I spend each week wondering what would he would say to

79
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:21.090
me if granted the power of human speech. But anyway,

80
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.140
if Archer spent his childhood absorbing ad-based content while being profoundly,

81
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:28.170
socially isolated and ignored by his sole parental figure,

82
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.090
what are the longterm effects?

83
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.480
Let's start with one of the most crucial aspects of childhood development,

84
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.250
learning, quote unquote, normal cultural and social practices, for instance,

85
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:38.881
saying, please,

86
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:42.720
and thank you knowing the boundaries of polite conversation and so on.

87
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.130
Most kids pick this stuff up via their family school church or local dojo

88
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.120
learning this stuff helps us functionally participate in society and get along

89
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:51.780
with others.

90
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.960
It also helps us develop healthy social boundaries so that we don't get an

91
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:58.320
erection in front of our mother inspired by the thought of her dying.

92
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.350
<v 0>The thought of me, Dan gives you any rock shot.</v>

93
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.800
<v 1>But Archer who grew up essentially parentless friendless,</v>

94
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.060
and without any cultural or religious structure lacks the type of socialization

95
00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:11.370
that most functional members of society have.

96
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.760
That's a big reason why he has such a hard time connecting with other people and

97
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:18.630
always seems hopelessly out of sync with his colleagues, lovers and friends.

98
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.760
<v 0>It's ironic, isn't it? I'm not sure that's technically irony what this is like.</v>

99
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.001
Oh,

100
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:28.980
Henry and Ilana's Morissette had a baby and named it this exact

101
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:30.960
situation. Oh yes it is.

102
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.800
<v 1>Instead of learning about culture, through observing genuine human interactions,</v>

103
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.520
Archer has learned everything through the small screen and his reactions to a

104
00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:39.780
whole number of scenarios.

105
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:43.080
Show that he'd be more at home in an episode of mash banks, radar,

106
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.090
or the Flintstones kick in at bedrock style than he ever is in the normal world.

107
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.630
He can't even appreciate Krieger being a good listener without comparing him to

108
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:54.600
Oprah B best conversationalists on daytime television.

109
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.220
<v 0>Seriously Krieger. You are. My Archer's problem.</v>

110
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.730
<v 1>Is that he's unable to draw a clear line of demarcation between the world,</v>

111
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:05.750
as it appears on screen and the real world a study carried out by the Canadian

112
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.500
pediatric society on the effects of television viewing on child development

113
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.160
found that the inability of young children to distinguish everyday reality from

114
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:14.330
what happens on screen,

115
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.020
along with their efforts to make sense of competing experiential realms may

116
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.630
interfere with and impede executive function,

117
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.620
which is to say the difficulty of separating between real life and TV life as a

118
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:25.400
child,

119
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.390
and eventually make real life adult tasks like separating our professional lives

120
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:30.410
from our sex lives,

121
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.250
more difficult Archer's own problem and distinguishing the screen world from the

122
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:38.570
real world bleeds into every aspect of his life from his blunt seduction

123
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:42.800
techniques to his over the top spy antics in Archer's TV, addled brain,

124
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.480
every real life mansion is probably hiding a Scrooge McDuck style coin vault in

125
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:48.280
the basement.

126
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.570
<v 0>Somewhere in this mansion,</v>

127
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:53.350
I have to assume is a gigantic Scrooge McDuck involved.

128
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.520
<v 1>But even more basic to becoming a functional human is understanding how language</v>

129
00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:00.550
works. That doesn't just mean the literal definition of words,

130
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.370
but also how they function in a social context.

131
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.660
It's knowing that the phrase it's lit doesn't mean the party house is on fire.

132
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.990
And our buddy Sterling did learn about the social function of language from

133
00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:15.130
observing organic human interactions or from a helpful teacher or therapist.

134
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.790
He learned it by absorbing dialogue written by a room full of Ivy league grads

135
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:23.260
and sweatpants see normal human language revolves around communicating ideas,

136
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.780
subtext and the nuances of human emotion.

137
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.290
But the dialogue in movies and television serves the purpose of creating

138
00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:32.770
entertaining narratives and keeping easily distracted eyeballs glued to the

139
00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:36.280
screen because of this is often laced with the type of over the top verbiage.

140
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:38.080
That might sound normal when the rock says it,

141
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.250
but would be ridiculous in real life. A bad-ass line might read on screen.

142
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.683
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

143
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.500
<v 1>But probably won't work when shouted in a rowdy Dave and busters Archer's</v>

144
00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:54.340
attempts at bad-ass Surrey are always imbued with a hint of patheticness in

145
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.850
trying to imitate what he saw on screen. He becomes a caricature.

146
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.230
<v 0>Something about I rescue Ilana, and she begs me to take her back.</v>

147
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:06.010
So then she will commit suicide. I swear to God, I had something for this.

148
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.730
<v 1>That's because our buddy Sterling's conception of language was shaped not by</v>

149
00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:13.630
interacting with his peers, but by observing rousing onscreen dialogue,

150
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.400
at least he didn't grow up on Gilmore girls.

151
00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:18.850
They talk so fast and all that coffee is to stall too much.

152
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.520
<v 2>In the moments just before the act. Well, God,</v>

153
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.980
we were actually discussing modern day Marxism in America,

154
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:26.860
which is not what I would have deemed to come and get it sort of conversation.

155
00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:27.641
But nevertheless,

156
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:30.130
he came and got it and I have to figure out what that means to me on a

157
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:30.964
psychological level.

158
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.600
<v 1>There's no more obvious example of this than Archer's favorite way to call out</v>

159
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:36.760
perceived innuendo, um, phrasing,

160
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.900
because TV both wants to be sexy and appealed to your grandma and Poughkeepsie.

161
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.090
It often realize unveiled sexual references, innuendos that we all kind of get,

162
00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.950
but don't really raise eyebrows.

163
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.130
And while these jokes may be normal in the conference room of Dunder Mifflin,

164
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.150
that's what she says in the real world. People usually just mean what they say,

165
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.760
especially in the workplace,

166
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.360
but because Archer's brain expects and dialogue and not conversation,

167
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.110
he sees this type of thing everywhere. Even when he can barely get a word out,

168
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.480
he can always muster up a phrasing.

169
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.430
And while Archer has a pretty good vocabulary,

170
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:11.730
his whole understanding of the social function of language seems to be deeply

171
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:14.340
shaped by years of consuming TV. As a result.

172
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:16.350
He not only misreads things said by others.

173
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.940
<v 0>That thought you put it on autopilot.</v>

174
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.240
<v 3>Dan's course in altitude.</v>

175
00:09:20.241 --> 00:09:24.440
It doesn't know how to find VOE air strip within a thousand miles.

176
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.600
So it can learn itself when it needs gas. And I, uh, misunderstood the question.

177
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.830
<v 1>But also says wildly offensive or out of bound things only to be surprised that</v>

178
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:35.120
they didn't go over smoothly.

179
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.800
<v 0>Hey, you want to smell something?</v>

180
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.733
<v 3>John speed dial.</v>

181
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.010
<v 1>He talks to normal folks like he's playing the role of an American James Bond</v>

182
00:09:43.011 --> 00:09:45.950
reboot, which I mean he is, but you get what I'm saying now.

183
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:49.580
We're not trying to say the consuming too much pop culture has made Archer dub

184
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.270
far from it. The guy is able to drop a Herman Melville reference on a dime.

185
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.010
I would prefer not to.

186
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.340
<v 0>Bartleby the Scrivener, anybody.</v>

187
00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.960
<v 1>And he speaks like 10 languages.</v>

188
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.100
<v 0>Yeah. There's cards [inaudible].</v>

189
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.310
<v 1>But because he considers Hollywood speak to be what's normative,</v>

190
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.460
he's left perpetually out of sync when conversing with others.

191
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.430
It's like trying to learn how to drive a car by watching the fast and the

192
00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:14.270
furious movies.

193
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.260
What makes perfect sense on screen only leads to you flipping your Ford Fiesta

194
00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:22.400
in real life. But my God, is it a glorious right up until that point? Of course,

195
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.810
this is Archer's problem.

196
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.690
He's learned how to be human through observing what he's seen in fictional

197
00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:29.750
programming meant to entertain, not educate. Now,

198
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.070
obviously we'd be remiss not to mention Archer's most obnoxious quality is super

199
00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:37.100
hyper, definitely troubling, overcompensating, masculine.

200
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.310
<v 0>But I've also cut back on, you know.</v>

201
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.450
<v 3>On VOD, certainly with you that could almost literally be.</v>

202
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.390
<v 0>Anonymous sex. If you must know.</v>

203
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.250
<v 1>Contemporary version of Hollywood,</v>

204
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:53.030
masculinity is often someone slight and hairless like Timothy Charlemagne

205
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.870
Archer's version of masculinity was shaped by the previously mentioned pile of

206
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:59.840
perfect chest hair with the human growing out of it. Burt Reynolds,

207
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.650
famous for playing the charming bad-ass who beats your by day and seduces your

208
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:04.484
wife by night.

209
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.000
Reynolds had an iconic run of films in the seventies and eighties and was a

210
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:08.834
massive.

211
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:12.400
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

212
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.160
<v 1>Of course, Reynolds was an actor playing too hyped up masculine stereotypes,</v>

213
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.580
not an actual human being embodying them, but for a young Archer,

214
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:22.880
he was the model of manhood, a sort of 2d father figure,

215
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:26.480
filling the whole lift by his biological father's absence and not to get too

216
00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:29.180
Freudian. But the one-time Archer meets his real father.

217
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.400
He gives him a stuffed alligator for his birthday.

218
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.960
Archer's favorite Reynolds film, none other than the 1976 classic Gator.

219
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.710
So Archer's projection of a father figure onto Mr. Reynolds is not without some

220
00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:41.330
sort of reptilian connection. Oh,

221
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:44.810
and it's kind of vaguely in play that Reynolds could be Archer's father.

222
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.850
So maybe the Gator thing is less Freudian and more.

223
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.530
<v 4>No. Remember how I said, I kind of have a date. It was kind of with your mom,</v>

224
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.250
regardless.

225
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.440
<v 1>Masculinity is the most important thing.</v>

226
00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:58.480
And if it means one thing for Sterling Archer,

227
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.310
it means sex lots and lots of sex sex, basically whenever,

228
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:04.870
wherever. And with whomever.

229
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.590
One of the only times in the show that he seems to actively avoid sex is when he

230
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.790
meets a 16 year old,

231
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.340
but he bookends their interaction by asking her to hit him up.

232
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:13.360
When she turns 18.

233
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.170
<v 0>Literally the minute you turn 18, please call me.</v>

234
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.250
<v 1>Lassie. I know,</v>

235
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.430
but it's a shocking that someone who learned everything from TV and film would

236
00:12:20.431 --> 00:12:21.600
have this view of sex.

237
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.190
<v 0>Shoot him Sierra, but just him. I think the twins are warming up to me, right?</v>

238
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.100
Are you guys getting some sinks.

239
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.881
<v 1>After all,</v>

240
00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:33.300
even most commercials have a sexual angle that guarantees if you buy the right

241
00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:35.910
body spray, you'll immediately be swimming in intercourse.

242
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.970
And those are just things that play in between all the shows and movies,

243
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.500
where in the final analysis,

244
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.350
everything was really about someone successfully getting laid.

245
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.120
As we noted in a previous video,

246
00:12:45.121 --> 00:12:48.120
much of Archer's persona seems modeled around James Bond,

247
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.660
who was basically Burt Reynolds that went to an English prep school and has

248
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:55.470
fancy gadgets. And if you've seen even nine seconds of a James Bond film,

249
00:12:55.471 --> 00:12:59.460
you've seen him seducing a woman named something like hungry bottoms or furry

250
00:12:59.461 --> 00:12:59.970
kitten.

251
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.080
So why wouldn't Archer's personality largely revolve around the utter importance

252
00:13:04.081 --> 00:13:06.600
of affirming his masculinity by sleeping with women?

253
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.560
It's not like he was exposed to any other model of how a guy should act or exist

254
00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:11.394
in a relationship,

255
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.210
but pay Archer's twisted upbringing at least kind of comes together.

256
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.040
At one point when the real Burt Reynolds,

257
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.740
his ideal father figure ends up sleeping with his mom.

258
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.020
<v 0>Meaning for drinks. I mean,</v>

259
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:26.670
obviously sex was implied since when is he your hero Archer?

260
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.760
<v 1>He tries to break them up and kidnaps may be Papa Burt,</v>

261
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.900
but the two eventually kind of bond and Bert gives Archer some insight on his

262
00:13:33.901 --> 00:13:35.730
fear of emotional vulnerability.

263
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.190
<v 0>I don't care about them. Yes you do.</v>

264
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.830
You just pretend you don't because you're afraid.

265
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.280
<v 1>Illusion of real Burt Reynolds in the episode seems like further evidence that</v>

266
00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:47.610
the creators of the show know that watching one dimensional Reynolds characters

267
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:48.480
ruined Archer,

268
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.110
but also that seeing the emotional complexity of the real bird just might help

269
00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:53.070
him grow. Of course,

270
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:56.370
while most of us don't have tinnitus from a lifetime of bullets whizzing by our

271
00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.140
ears and somehow not killing us.

272
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.200
<v 0>This is what I was talking about, but the whole tinnitus thing.</v>

273
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.550
<v 1>Any of us have spent more hours than we might want to admit staring at screens</v>

274
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.300
and theaters and living rooms and on our phones while we take our ninth bathroom

275
00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:09.960
break at work.

276
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.690
So maybe we're all a bit more like Archer than we'd like to think.

277
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.840
But what do you think wisecrack is Archer a case study and why?

278
00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:19.500
Sometimes we need to step away from the screens and learn how to be human,

279
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.070
or are we just using this show to work through our own childhood abandonment

280
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:26.010
