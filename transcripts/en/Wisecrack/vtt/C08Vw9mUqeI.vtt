00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>This video is brought to you by dragon city,</v>

2
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.920
Jack Jared here and today,

3
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:14.060
we're talking about the smart and stylist J RPG that lets you simultaneously

4
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:16.940
date your high school teacher, your middle school, age, step stepsister,

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.540
and an alcoholic lowest lane, persona five. For those of you,

6
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:21.950
who've never played persona five.

7
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:25.820
We recommend pausing this video and playing through the 120 hour campaign.

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.880
But if you don't have that much time, we'll summarize it for you.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.250
The persona series is basically what you get.

10
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:35.060
If a group of otaku made a Pokemon clone set in the world of inside out,

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.120
he spent half the game and a high school, social management simulator,

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.310
and the other half is a superhero gentlemen,

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.820
fif that enters people's cognitions in order to catch them all, I'll be it.

14
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:47.450
Instead of Peaky, choose your nabbing, mythological monsters, gods heroes,

15
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:49.760
historical figures, and characters or literature,

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.540
including whatever the hell this is going by. The code name joker.

17
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:57.140
You slowly assemble a crew called the Phantom thieves of hearts to heist the

18
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.100
inner most desires from the most powerful and corrupt adults in society.

19
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.280
<v 1>You sons of, what's the job.</v>

20
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.060
<v 0>So let's look at whether the aspects of persona,</v>

21
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:13.040
which people praise so often are actually deep or dumb quarters ahead for the

22
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.860
original game, but not for the expanded version persona fibroid,

23
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.920
which won't be stateside until the end of March. Before we get into it,

24
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:20.750
I want to give a shout out to dragon city,

25
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.810
a mobile RPG available on iOS and Android.

26
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
Dragon city is like a hero collector, but instead of heroes,

27
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:28.070
you collect dragons,

28
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.310
generate gold to buy food and level up your dragons for battle.

29
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.150
There are hundreds of very cute and very ferocious dragons hidden in dragon city

30
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:38.960
for you to collect. I recently found the binge dragon, my personal favorite,

31
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:42.500
the movie fanatic dragon, and a serial killer dragon.

32
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.300
There's even a poo dragon.

33
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.930
You can also breed different species to complete your collection.

34
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.720
I bred my binge dragon with my movie fanatic dragon,

35
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:54.500
and they had a neon dragon collect as many dragons as you can and use them in

36
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.060
battle. But more on that later,

37
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.880
you can download the game for free using the link in the description.

38
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.480
And now back to the show part one union psychology,

39
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.620
Carl Yoon was the founder of analytical psychology just as his colleagues,

40
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:11.240
Sigmund Freud invented an entire vocabulary for psychoanalysis human coin terms

41
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:15.410
like archetype shadow persona and the collective unconscious and the series

42
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.220
cites its union influences explicitly and persona for golden,

43
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.460
you can unlock new episodes of Mr. EDA gal was TV classroom,

44
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.400
which are straight up lectures about Jungian psychology,

45
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.030
but the primary place you encounter these union terms is during the combat

46
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:31.910
sections. When our regular high schoolers enter the metaverse,

47
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.110
they transform into personas that are dramatizations of the union concept much

48
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:40.520
in the same way as joy and anger in inside out our drama desertions of emotions.

49
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.510
Really the whole world of persona is a dramatization of Young's ideas about the

50
00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:45.344
human psyche.

51
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.010
Take the metaverse a world created by human cognition that the Phantom thieves

52
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.030
are capable of entering the metaverse is representative of all psychological

53
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:57.140
activity, collective and individual conscious and unconscious.

54
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.910
Some parts called palaces represent an individual's mental activity,

55
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.990
specifically their distorted perspective of a place in the real world.

56
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.240
Take the girls volleyball, coach comma Shita.

57
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.170
He's got such a high opinion of his status at Shujin Academy that he envisions

58
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.050
it as a castle ruled by him as its King.

59
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.820
Other parts such as momentos are how society as a whole sees the world around

60
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.930
it. And given the deep cynicism of the day, it's not a pleasant place.

61
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.520
This shared psychic space society along with the sea of souls,

62
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:30.840
from which all shadows and personas our drama dissertations have a union concept

63
00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:34.920
called the collective unconscious it's those parts of the mind that we inherited

64
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:38.010
from our most remote ancestors like fight or flight,

65
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.540
but it also includes what you described as preexistent forms, the archetypes,

66
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:46.530
which give definite form to certain psychic contents of the innumerable

67
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:50.820
archetypes within the collective unconscious. You can consider for I'm ordeal,

68
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.500
the most basic and universal images among which are the persona and the shadow

69
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.420
personas are social masks that the ego chooses to wear you and himself described

70
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:03.960
them as designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others.

71
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.370
And on the other to conceal the true nature of the individual in Latin persona

72
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:11.550
refers to the masks worn by actors and in the game,

73
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.810
whenever they enter the metaverse,

74
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.460
the Phantom quite literally where their personas as masks per young,

75
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.690
the thieves personas are how they want society to see them and how they want to

76
00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:25.050
see themselves take on who is apprehensive about her beauty,

77
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:29.370
because it draws unwanted attention. When her persona awakens, it says Carmen,

78
00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:30.480
from the famous opera,

79
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.830
a fierce femme fatale who uses her pension for seduction to deadlift fact

80
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.330
effectively this transforms ons appearance liability into a strength.

81
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.050
Another union is shadow or the psychological aspects,

82
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:46.890
which the conscious self is unaware of and would rather not acknowledge in the

83
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.740
game. Shadows serve as the enemies, most are generic,

84
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:52.800
but the bosses are shadows specific to certain characters,

85
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.770
but the game designers didn't just look too young for their world-building.

86
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.280
His ideas are equally represented in the game, play mechanics as well.

87
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.840
The way shadows and personas are grouped reflects yeoman's concept of archetypes

88
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.280
per EWM. The term archetype is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite

89
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:10.020
mythological images are motifs,

90
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:14.190
but the archetype is a tendency to form representations of a motif

91
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.540
representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic

92
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.030
pattern. So the personas aren't themselves, well,

93
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:23.550
part of the collective unconscious that everyone inherits,

94
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.190
no one is born with the idea of Odin in their head,

95
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.670
but they do have part of their mental space sequestered off for the idea of

96
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.080
Senex, the generic wise old man. And this idea is given form through characters,

97
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:36.030
such as Odin, Paul and [inaudible],

98
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.230
who are all grouped together in the game organization to capture a shadow.

99
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:43.230
Joker must find some point of commonality with it. That is,

100
00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:45.840
he must recognize it as being part of himself.

101
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.100
Similarly confronting and recognizing one's own shadows is a distinctive asset

102
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.290
[inaudible] process of individuation.

103
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.440
Once he's moved it from the dark parts of his psyche into the light of

104
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:58.940
consciousness, joker can then equip the shadow as a persona,

105
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.650
but there's another game game play use for personas that better exemplifies the

106
00:06:02.651 --> 00:06:07.090
union concept as joker converses with important people called confidence,

107
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.750
his bond with them strengthens each of these has a particular archetype that

108
00:06:10.751 --> 00:06:14.620
most closely exemplifies their personality by equipping a persona belonging to

109
00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:18.340
the same archetype before conversing with a confidant joker forges his

110
00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:19.840
friendship with them faster.

111
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.600
Since they're recognizing something of themselves in him.

112
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.200
This is people of Young's idea that we were different personas for different

113
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:26.830
people,

114
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.580
choosing to share one side of ourselves with friends and other with family and

115
00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:33.850
another, with coworkers even more youngian is the Phantom thieves,

116
00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:37.420
entire modus operandi. They enter into their marks, psyche and steal,

117
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:39.220
whatever it is, the individual treasures.

118
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:43.150
So much that it's twisted their desires and distorted their perception of

119
00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:46.210
reality and always end up confronting the Target's shadow.

120
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.140
After this treasure is stolen and the shadow defeated the individual undergoes a

121
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:51.850
dramatic change of personality.

122
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.930
This can be seen as a kin to psychotherapy despite stylizing themselves as

123
00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:56.350
thieves.

124
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.250
Their goal is to affect psychological and moral improvement in the subject,

125
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.180
albeit less talking on a couch to defeat inner demons and more slashing them

126
00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:06.580
with samurai swords, given all this,

127
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.390
the consonance between the world-building story and the game play mechanics all

128
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:12.430
around this one, unifying motif.

129
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.240
And we've absolutely got to give personas use of Jungian and psychology,

130
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.260
a certified deep part, two esoteric taro.

131
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.130
The game continues its union motifs with the use of taro to Oregon.

132
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.310
The nice elements such as shadows, personas, and confidence.

133
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.030
According to the archetypes found in the cards you and himself acknowledged the

134
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.330
taro as containing compassion, selling archetypical imagery, he wrote,

135
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.050
it also seems to as if the set of pictures in the taro cards were distantly

136
00:07:38.051 --> 00:07:40.450
descended from the archetypes of transformation.

137
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.320
Taro began back in the 15th century as a deck for playing card games.

138
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.920
In addition to the traditional four suits, AKA the minor Arcana,

139
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.070
it included 22 Trump cards, the major Arcana.

140
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.180
It wasn't until the late 18th century that it began to be used for hope purposes

141
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.380
of which you're probably most familiar with cartoon scene or defining the future

142
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:00.460
by drawing cards.

143
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.390
But apart from fortune telling the Terrell was also corporated into a cult

144
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:07.300
schools of thought with each partaking on multitudes of me,

145
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.740
such as the major Arconic corresponding to one of the 22 letters of the Hebrew

146
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.590
alphabet and 22 paths of the Kabbalah tree of life,

147
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.250
or the four suits of the minor Arcana corresponding to the four classical

148
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:20.140
elements and the four letters of the Tetra.

149
00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:22.930
Gramaton the use of the taro as a set of symbols,

150
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:27.130
became known as esoteric taro to distinguish it from its primary purpose as

151
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:27.964
playing cards.

152
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:33.160
The order of the major Arcana also tells us story known as the fool's journey

153
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.910
that is seen as both the story of each individual soul and the history of the

154
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:39.160
universe as a whole persona fives.

155
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:42.610
Most successful well application of esoteric taro is in structuring its

156
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.130
confidence system around the fool's journey.

157
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.800
Joker's own journey begins when he meets Igor,

158
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.100
the confidant associated with Arcana zero Lamott,

159
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.950
AKA the fool in esoteric taro.

160
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.290
The fool is at the first on a path towards self-realization with that path,

161
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.230
taking him through these subsequent cards of the major Arcana.

162
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.950
This is reflected in Joker's need to maximize his rank with all of his

163
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:05.760
confidence.

164
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.810
Each of whom is explicitly linked to one of the major Arcana and whose own side

165
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:12.750
story teaches joker, the lessons of their associated card.

166
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.740
It's not enough for him to simply beat the final boss like the fool he has to

167
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:21.060
achieve enlightenment in the way prescribed by esoteric taro in order to unlock

168
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.230
the game's true ending,

169
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.890
which are kind of the confidence belonged to often reflects the role they play

170
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:26.724
in the narrative.

171
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.450
Occasionally the game makes a particularly appropriate connection regarding what

172
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.290
our Connor a character belongs to and which persona they manifest.

173
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.120
MCOs are Connor is Lopez traditionally associated with the legendary Pope. Joan,

174
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.390
the very same as Mercado's initial persona Yohanna,

175
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.560
but more often the game makes a surface level association between the characters

176
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:48.810
are Connor and their personality ons.

177
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:53.010
Arcana is Le Amaru the lovers primarily because she is the first love interest

178
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:56.520
available in the game and the object of desire to multiple male characters,

179
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.360
Futaba of our meat, literally hermits herself away in her room.

180
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.930
[inaudible] of the, of fourtune is herself a tarot reading,

181
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:06.840
fortune teller and Tate to Kimmy's work in the medical field,

182
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:10.740
places her in proximity to death, hers being the card with no name,

183
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.150
AKA Lamotte.

184
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.170
This last one reveals how Alice his understanding of esoteric taro can be a bit

185
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:20.790
shallow is the 13th. Arcana is associated not with literal death,

186
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.690
but is rather symbolic of endings and change. In some cases,

187
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:28.230
the surface level connections come at the cost of a deeper one powers.

188
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:32.610
Final persona [inaudible] of the emperor Sakana is specifically called the queen

189
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:33.990
of heaven in the Bible.

190
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.040
This naturally compares her with Mary whom the Catholics affirm as the Regina

191
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:41.550
Chaley, the queen of heaven. However, Arthur, Edward Waite,

192
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:46.140
who co-created the most famous esoteric taro deck contrast the Empress with Mary

193
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:50.460
as queen of heaven saying the emphasis is associated with Mary only as refugee

194
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.120
impeccably. Horam the refuge of sinners and an earthly garden of Eden.

195
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.590
According to him, the emperor is very specifically not a heavenly figure.

196
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.390
The game gets it backwards. This is hardly nitpicking. Esoteric.

197
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.230
Tarot is interesting specifically because its imagery and structure invite

198
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:09.450
systemization with diverse schools of thoughts,

199
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.110
like the Jewish Kabbalah and the Catholic Corpus doctrine in getting the

200
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:14.760
meanings mixed up persona five,

201
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:18.060
doesn't quite justify structuring its systems around the taro.

202
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.440
The game is obviously interested in taro for its esoteric associations as well

203
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:23.520
as its union ones,

204
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.270
but fails to engage with the esotericism in any real meaningful ways.

205
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.840
The fact that the game follows the taro of Marsay, an older deck,

206
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.470
more associated with card games rather than the rider Waite deck,

207
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.800
which was specifically constructed to convey esoteric symbolism,

208
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.210
certainly evidences this while the fool's journey of the confidant system and

209
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:46.590
one or two of the characters associated Arcana are somewhat deep for the most

210
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:51.240
part persona five's use of taro is kind of dumb part three

211
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.010
ethical systems and moral realism, but.

212
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.100
<v 2>Persona five is also structured to make a moral argument.</v>

213
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.240
The story is built around.

214
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:02.020
Heisting a few major palaces parts of the metaverse that have been warped by the

215
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:06.100
distorted perception of a sinful individual because the Phantom thieves suck at

216
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.040
sneaking all of their heist culminate in a climactic boss,

217
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:12.160
battle against the palaces owner or lease their shadow.

218
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.390
These big bads are based on the seven deadly sins with each one of the palaces

219
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.670
explicitly named after one of the vices.

220
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.080
Number one comma Shita like many dudes who coach high school girls athletics is

221
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.500
pervy. His palace is the castle of lust inside it.

222
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:29.770
His shadow looks like as modus who according to theologian,

223
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.090
Peter bins filled is the Prince of hell associated with lust to modern.

224
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.930
Rami is an artist that uses other people's works to promote his own fame.

225
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.300
So his palace is the museum of vanity.

226
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.620
Three kind of Shiro is a corpulent crime boss who hungers for more and more

227
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:47.620
money from those he IX stores that may sound like greed,

228
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:49.600
but his palace is the bank of gluttony,

229
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.970
a theme reinforced not only by his road tenacity,

230
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.400
but by the BLC bulb like appearance of his shadow.

231
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.450
That being the demon bins filled connected to gluttony for Futaba,

232
00:12:58.451 --> 00:13:01.900
his anger at herself for apparently causing her mother's death results in her

233
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:02.381
palace.

234
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:07.090
Being the pyramid of wrath five Okumura is a businessman who envisions his

235
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:10.390
employees as robots existing only to labor for him,

236
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.500
his palace being the spaceship of grief. He isn't interested in money solely,

237
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:18.370
but wealth in all its various expressions. I E Mamon.

238
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.750
So it's appropriate that the same demon is also the name of his shadow. Again,

239
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.760
following bins fields list six niyama is a prosecutor who is so envious

240
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:31.000
of her colleagues when records that she's willing to do anything to get a

241
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:35.140
conviction. Her palace is the casino of envy for the house always wins.

242
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:40.120
And her shadow per bins filled is Leviathan seven Cheeto is a politician

243
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:40.540
who,

244
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.800
when he tried to force himself on a woman and joker saved her head joker charged

245
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:48.790
with assault is expressed AME as prime minister is a screw over the unwashed

246
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:53.020
masses while profiting his chosen few, you know, a typical politician.

247
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.180
His palace is the cruiser of pride.

248
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.560
Traditionally that deadly is sent eight humanity as a whole is responsible for

249
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:03.430
such intellectual and moral laziness that they collectively have a distorted

250
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:07.210
perception of reality leading to the public palace known as mementos,

251
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.890
AKA the prison of slough. And no, we didn't forget how to count.

252
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.110
The seven deadly sins have as their antecedent.

253
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:17.860
The monk Evagrius pontic says eight evil thoughts until Pope Gregory.

254
00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:20.980
The first subsumed Vainglory under pride, the ordering.

255
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.200
<v 3>Of the villains occurrences conforms roughly to the.</v>

256
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.170
<v 2>Severity of the sins per traditional Catholic understanding.</v>

257
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.580
This has seen most vividly in Dante Purgatorio. Dante is ordering was lust,

258
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.450
gluttony, avarice, slaw wrap, and be fried.

259
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.230
This is essentially the same as the order of the palaces and persona with one

260
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:39.430
important difference.

261
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.930
Persona moves sloths to the final slot suggesting that slot is

262
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:45.580
properly the deadliest sin.

263
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.520
In addition to the inherent evil of their signature sin,

264
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:51.980
the villains are also ordered with respect to their sphere of influence with

265
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:55.520
greater influence, allowing for a greater severity to their transgressions.

266
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.150
Whereas comma sheet, his influence is limited only to Shujin Academy.

267
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.990
Modern Rami has influenced over the entire art community can have Shiro over a

268
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:07.400
wide swath of the criminal underworld and Okamura and Shito on a national stage

269
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.100
as captains of business and politics. Respectively,

270
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.260
the final boss is Yalda beyo,

271
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.980
a Gnostic name for the creator of the world because it wouldn't be a proper J

272
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:19.160
RPG. If you didn't kill God at the end and being God,

273
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:21.800
his influence extends over the whole of humanity.

274
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.730
The name Yalda beyo comes from the Apocrypha and of John.

275
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.930
Now the arc-on who is weak has three names. The first is yelled Aveo.

276
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.260
The second is sock floss and the third is SEM mil.

277
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.510
This connects Yalda beyo with the penultimate boss Shito whose shadow is mil and

278
00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:42.040
joker himself as sock Kloss means fool a reference back to joker being on the

279
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:46.210
fool's journey. Now the narrative progresses in one other interesting way.

280
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.780
The villains are ordered roughly according to which system of ethics they're

281
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.180
supposed authority derives from comma,

282
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.330
cheetah and Mata Rami are both adults in positions of authority,

283
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.400
preying on high schoolers, comma, Ashita,

284
00:15:57.401 --> 00:16:01.690
by hitting on literal and Mata Rami by stealing his students' artwork,

285
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.570
neither his actions aligned with any ethical theory,

286
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.050
both simply presumed that age gives them natural authority.

287
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.480
This is pretty much the first ethical framework.

288
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.890
Any individual operates under to listen to those older than us can a Shiro

289
00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.080
self-loathing at his own perceived weakness,

290
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.830
leads him to operate under the theory that might makes right and to build a

291
00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:22.870
criminal enterprise to compensate.

292
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.380
All of these are what psychologists Lawrence Kohlberg in his stages of moral

293
00:16:26.381 --> 00:16:30.700
development categorized as pre-conventional such moral attitudes are marked by

294
00:16:30.701 --> 00:16:35.350
their deference to superior power or prestige as opposed to principled moral

295
00:16:35.351 --> 00:16:38.350
reasoning. Alternatively, as a prosecutor side,

296
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.650
ne Jima occupies Kohlberg's fourth stage of moral development,

297
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:46.360
a conventional category in which the law itself is the foundation for morality,

298
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.980
whether or not the law is actually just Szeto and Yalda bailed represent

299
00:16:50.981 --> 00:16:55.030
Kohlberg's post-conventional stages of moral development as prime minister

300
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.670
shadow's authority derives from the consent of the governed.

301
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.750
This is Kohlberg's fifth stage in which laws are malleable based on the will of

302
00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:06.430
the masses. Kohlberg's sixth stage is that of universal ethical principles,

303
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.240
right? And wrong are the same for all people at all places at all times,

304
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.130
regardless of man-made laws,

305
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.630
one permutation of a universal ethical principle is divine command theory.

306
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.650
The idea that the foundation of morality is whatever God says is right or wrong

307
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.030
as a stand in for God.

308
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.650
Ya'll debate is representative of this type of moral reasoning in fighting all

309
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.370
of these foes.

310
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.000
The Phantom thieves are not merely opposing the deadly sins themselves,

311
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:35.200
but also the various ethical frameworks to which society has subscribed.

312
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.340
And we think this is why the structure of the game impute slop as the deadliest

313
00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:43.810
sin of all humanity Slav has made it intellectually and morally lazy.

314
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.710
Humanity has abdicated the hard work of moral decision making to these various

315
00:17:47.711 --> 00:17:52.110
ethical systems and even harder work of actually being morally active members of

316
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:56.430
society to those few individuals running the various spheres of influence.

317
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.520
And unfortunately they've not been particularly more the themes while far from

318
00:18:01.521 --> 00:18:06.080
being immoral or amoral don't neatly conform their ethical hand-wringing to any

319
00:18:06.081 --> 00:18:07.670
prescribed ethical theories.

320
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.180
This is what differentiates them from the slothfulness of the masses under the

321
00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:15.440
sway of Yalda beyo throughout all the heist cumulatively the thieves go through

322
00:18:15.441 --> 00:18:19.160
an ethical process that French philosophers Jaak Derry dot described as

323
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.750
undecidability essentially all moral decisions come down to deciding between

324
00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:28.370
taking actions based on a moral framework or rejecting those actions for any

325
00:18:28.371 --> 00:18:28.821
reason,

326
00:18:28.821 --> 00:18:33.110
ranging from not feeling like it to distrust for the moral frameworks at play.

327
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.071
For instance,

328
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:38.300
the thieves consistently reject the justifications for laws that side need Jima

329
00:18:38.301 --> 00:18:39.530
blindly enforces.

330
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.710
And even when the rules seem to have a foundation such as shadows,

331
00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:44.530
democratic mandate or yell to bail,

332
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:49.310
divine commands such wrote formula won't necessarily apply to individual

333
00:18:49.311 --> 00:18:50.990
circumstances. Thus,

334
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.800
according to dairy dot all the moral decision-making is undecidable by

335
00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:58.850
prescribed ways of thinking a decision that did not go through the ordeal of the

336
00:18:58.851 --> 00:19:01.100
undecidable would not be a free decision.

337
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.660
It would only be the programmable application or unfolding of a calculable

338
00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:06.494
process,

339
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.540
only exerting great moral and intellectual effort by continually undergoing

340
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:14.000
Derridean undecidability time. And again,

341
00:19:14.001 --> 00:19:18.530
throughout their careers are our heroes able to avoid the deadly sin of

342
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.670
slaw, but while the Phantom Phoebes avoided slothfulness themselves,

343
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.430
by being the only ones to take on these various systems,

344
00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:28.520
they become a moral crutch who everyone and else outsources their

345
00:19:28.521 --> 00:19:31.220
decision-making too. So whether it's the thieves or,

346
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.770
or [inaudible] the end result is the same.

347
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.760
This is why ya'll debate remains as powerful as ever even after Shito is

348
00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:38.900
defeated. At first,

349
00:19:38.901 --> 00:19:42.320
this seems to be an example of the game's mechanics coming into conflict with

350
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.100
its narrative.

351
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.300
The story is saying that society itself has to overcome its moral lethargy,

352
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.050
but by virtue of being a game that can only come about by decisions you as the

353
00:19:51.051 --> 00:19:51.460
player,

354
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:56.330
make the NPCs never make a real choice and continue to avoid confronting

355
00:19:56.331 --> 00:20:01.070
undecidability and continue being slothful hiding the true ending behind

356
00:20:01.071 --> 00:20:04.610
maxing out all the confidence is a smart solution to this problem.

357
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.410
That is to say that in the true ending,

358
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.520
all the NPCs who help with the final victory have gone through the same ethical

359
00:20:10.521 --> 00:20:12.290
challenge as the Phantom thieves,

360
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.100
despite challenging such ethical frameworks by framing the decision to decide

361
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.710
Troy Yalda bailed as unambiguously, right?

362
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.130
Ultimately affirms moral realism.

363
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:27.230
Even if no one ethical system can fully articulate what makes good right and

364
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.550
evil wrong, good and evil are very much real. It could be Dems,

365
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:34.520
the moral nihilism of the games, foil Goro, a catchy.

366
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.210
This is a departure from Derrida who rejects the notion that we're ever

367
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:42.590
approaching a true ethics and claims undecidability is the whole of the matter.

368
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.730
But the game says it's only a step toward the truth of right and wrong.

369
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.100
Thankfully, the game is.

370
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 0>Much more clear than real life and assuring that you did the right thing mainly</v>

371
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:54.970
by rewarding you with an anime wife who on Valentine's day.

372
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:59.500
So for balancing the complication of ethical systems with an affirmation of

373
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:03.730
moral realism and giving as extensive and examination of moral wrongdoing as

374
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:07.780
Dante persona five is as deep as the ninth circle of hell.

375
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.250
But tell us what you think wisecrack are being too much like fortune tellers,

376
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.680
reading too much into what's just not there.

377
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.280
Or did we successfully infiltrate your cognition and force a change of heart as

378
00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:20.470
