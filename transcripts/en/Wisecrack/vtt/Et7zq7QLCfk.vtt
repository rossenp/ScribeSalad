<v 1>Wisecrack quarantine. Jared here,</v>

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.490
it's been a while since HBO's Watchman concluded.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.660
And many of you have noticed that we've been uncharacteristically quiet that's

5
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:17.300
because this show is dense. Sure.

6
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:21.800
It pretty overtly deals with race in America, but there's just so much going on.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.090
It's rife with God complexes, illusions to the graphic, novel and characters,

8
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:29.930
reading very specific books like Ernest Hemingway's for whom the bell tolls.

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.160
It seems like nothing in this show is a coincidence and we really want it to get

10
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:34.790
it right.

11
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.200
So what is Watchman trying to say between the convoluted conspiracy is, well,

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.760
we've got an idea to quote our favorite blue man. Nothing ever ends.

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.410
What never ends let's find out welcome is wisecrack edition on the philosophy of

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.570
HBO's Watchman. And of course.

15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.590
<v 0>Spoilers ahead.</v>

<v 1>First, a shout out to keeps for sponsoring this video. A lot of, you know,</v>

17

how much I like my hair and I appreciate the nice comments and some of the less

18
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:04.790
nice ones, either way. It's basically become part of my identity.

19
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:07.400
So I'm pretty much scared out of my mind about losing it.

20
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.980
And from what I've learned, prevention is the key.

21
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.900
And now back to the show, first, a quick recap,

33
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.980
Watchman takes place over 30 years after the events of Alan Moore and Dave

34
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:04.550
Gibbons graphic novel. So let's start there in the 1980s,

35
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:08.390
the United States and the USSR are on the verge of a Nial leading the world in a

36
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:12.260
nuclear apocalypse. So the world's smartest man, Adrian Vite.

37
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:17.120
Concocts a plan to avert the war through fear and sends a giant cyanic squid

38
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.870
to attack New York city killing millions. The squid,

39
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.450
the world believes is an invader from another dimension.

40
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.290
So everybody unites us one nuclear apocalypse averted.

41
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.610
The history of watchman's world is very different from our own before and after

42
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.730
the graphic novel, the United States won the Vietnam war.

43
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.560
Richard Nixon was never impeached.

44
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.950
Robert Redford becomes president and term limits have been abolished.

45
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.290
<v 0>God. Robert Redford is still precedent.</v>

46
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.710
<v 1>Also Dr. Manhattan used his godlike intelligence to invent a bunch of</v>

47
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:51.470
electronics, but people thought he was giving them cancer.

48
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.550
So now the world exists,

49
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:56.660
mostly devoid of things like cell phones and lithium batteries watch me and the

50
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:00.190
TV show picks up in modern day. Tulsa roar shack,

51
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:04.060
who in the graphic novel sent his journal detailing fights plot to a right-wing

52
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.880
newspaper has been mostly dismissed as a crank,

53
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.630
but his Vistage has been taken up by a group of white supremacists known as the

54
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.820
seventh cavalry. They've been terrorizing.

55
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:17.080
The police who have also taken up masks to shield their identity within this

56
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.720
literal race war is detective Angela, a bar,

57
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.860
a black woman who must learn about her family's past by ODing on her grandpa's

58
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.100
memory pills. Also, she, it is heavily implied.

59
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.910
It becomes God before we can grasp what the show means by.

60
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.870
We have to understand one of watchman's recurring motifs judgment,

61
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.510
more in Gibbons Watchman, invoke the Latin phrase,

62
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.380
who watches the Watchman to warn of the dangers of master vigilantes,

63
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:46.330
taking justice into their own hands.

64
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.950
That is what do people do with unfettered power. If you're the comedian,

65
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:53.260
you gleefully murder with a smiley badge,

66
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.940
because it's kind of funny in the show to be cruelty and tyranny of individuals

67
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:01.960
exerting their judgment outside the law is everywhere. Vite, callously,

68
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:06.250
disregards the life that exists to serve him, creating the creepiest. I'm sorry.

69
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:09.850
A father has ever conveyed to his daughter when he's put on trial for his

70
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:10.450
crimes.

71
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.350
The judges keen to note that a jury of one's peers is the cornerstone of a fair

72
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:15.610
trial before noting.

73
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.690
<v 2>You are not his peers. I sucked.</v>

74
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.680
I have taken the Liberty of assembling an alternative jury,

75
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.260
much more suited to the task.

76
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 1>The point being one is entitled to be judged by one's peers.</v>

77
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.560
And while Vite might consider himself a quasi God above these creatures,

78
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.260
the judge considers him to be below humanity.

79
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.280
The whole problem with vigilante justice, especially of the masked variety,

80
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.180
is that they Rob people of the opportunity to be judged by the legal system or

81
00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:58.260
their peers. But the show is not just interested in individual vigilantism,

82
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.800
but in the vigilantism of mobs in the show's first scenes,

83
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.060
a young will Reeves watches,

84
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:05.820
a film about a black sheriff who captures a white cattle,

85
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.650
thief and rebuts calls for mob justice, with a plea instead to trust the law.

86
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.120
This scene is interrupted and we're shown another kind of mob justice as white

87
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:19.080
Tolsons massacre,

88
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.770
their black neighbors after a black man was accused of assaulting a white woman.

89
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.310
One way to answer the question of vigilante violence is what the work of

90
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:27.780
sociologist, max WebVR,

91
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.950
who defines a state as an entity that claims the monopoly of the legitimate use

92
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:34.530
of physical force within a community. In other words,

93
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.860
I can't just go and rally my friends to beat up the guy who sold me a bootleg

94
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:42.000
copy of Pokemon gold, nor can I physically coerce him to give me a refund.

95
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.840
Instead,

96
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.490
I have to call the police who as agents of the state are allowed to use force in

97
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:48.600
carrying out the law.

98
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.410
This is the basic conflict between the U S government and our master adventurers

99
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.990
as the Kenai criminalized vigilantism,

100
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.900
but trusting the law and the state's of violence isn't as Reeves learns a

101
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.610
magical cure to the ills of the day.

102
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.930
<v 2>You ain't gone get justice with a badge we'll raves.</v>

103
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.210
You can't get it with that hood.

104
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.720
<v 1>One way to understand this is through Michelle CO's proposition,</v>

105
00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:15.190
that politics is the continuation of war by other means Fuko was inverting.

106
00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:18.610
The famous aphorism. That war is merely the continuation of politics.

107
00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:21.430
By other means, if, for instance, the U S military,

108
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:24.490
his goal was to defeat the threat of Nazi-ism during world war II.

109
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.840
We can look at the politics of post-war Germany as a continuation of the allied

110
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:32.290
victory. As the country rapidly did not suffer. Of course,

111
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:36.250
the show explores a similar idea with Vietnam statehood as the police do the

112
00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:38.470
role otherwise done by the U S military.

113
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.950
But the Wars don't always have to be fought with tanks and generals.

114
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.280
If we're to consider the historical armed suppression of America's black

115
00:06:45.281 --> 00:06:49.180
community through lynchings firebombings, et cetera, as a kind of war,

116
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.070
then we can see how that war was institutionalized into politics. In Watchman,

117
00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:56.230
the Tulsa race massacre is the war.

118
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.280
And much of what comes after is the politics seeking justice through the law,

119
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.220
by becoming a police officer will read soon learns.

120
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:07.240
Many of his colleagues are secret white supremacists shielding their allies from

121
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:08.590
arrest years later,

122
00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:11.620
this relationship has made even more clear by Senator Joe keen,

123
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.340
who more or less admits that he started a race war to help his presidential

124
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:16.174
aspirations,

125
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.380
where he could use the full power of the law to keep America's minorities in

126
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:21.214
their place.

127
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.730
<v 2>You're wrong about psych labs? We're not racist.</v>

128
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.110
We're about restoring balance in those times when our country forgets the

129
00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:33.910
principles upon which it was founded because the scales have Tim away

130
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:34.744
too far,

131
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.310
and it is extremely difficult to be a white man in America.

132
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.200
<v 1>But well, before that,</v>

133
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.580
he describes the tension between the police and the seventh cavalry as a managed

134
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:47.020
piece to achieve his ends.

135
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.430
<v 2>I came down here and assumed the leadership of these idiots to prevent that from</v>

136
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:55.240
happening again. And my butter judge did the same as chief of police.

137
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.130
Each of us managing our respective teams so that we could maintain the peace.

138
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.690
<v 1>As Fuko writes,</v>

139
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.250
the role of political power is perpetually to use a sort of silent war to

140
00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:10.630
reinscribe that relationship of force and to reinscribe it and institutions,

141
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.650
economic inequalities language, and even the bodies of individuals,

142
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.370
even the members of Cyclops, implicitly share this view of politics,

143
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:22.150
but with themselves as the victims with Redford, as president,

144
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:25.120
the members of Cyclops feel that they've lost their war,

145
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.090
that policies like red foundations are just a way of,

146
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.850
as King describes putting the white man down.

147
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.460
<v 0>First, he took her guns.</v>

148
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.220
And then he made us say, sorry, over and over again,

149
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:40.503
sorry,

150
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.180
sorry for the alleged sins of those who died decades

151
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:49.990
before we were born, sorry for the color of our skin.

152
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.040
<v 1>Watchman is not just about the dangers of vigilante justice,</v>

153
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.180
whether from Lynch or war crime, committing comedians,

154
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.470
but about how war and violence can become embedded in the law.

155
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.630
And when violence gets embedded in the law,

156
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.190
it can often evade judgment as a result after all justice is

157
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.080
blind. Speaking of judgment,

158
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:12.900
if you weren't sure this was at the top of Damon Lindelof, mine,

159
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.110
there's one song that keeps coming up that you may have noticed during vites

160
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:16.944
trial.

161
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.880
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

162
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.980
<v 1>That's the Lac remote. So from Mozart's Requiem,</v>

163
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.400
let's translate those lyrics full of tears will be that day.

164
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:32.480
When from the ashes shall arise, the guilty man to be judged, therefore,

165
00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:34.430
spare him, Oh God, you know,

166
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.380
just a song about being judged at the end of the week.

167
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.573
<v 2>World.</v>

168
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.900
<v 1>It plays when lady true tells Angela, Dr.</v>

169
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:45.320
Manhattan is in Tulsa when Wade discovers the Cyclops hideout,

170
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.980
but most notably plays when Blake arrests Vite. And he says,

171
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.070
who do you think you are? Hold judgment over me.

172
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.910
The point being whether godlike actual gods or just people dressed up like

173
00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:56.570
Batman,

174
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.260
many of our characters feel like their fellow humans are inadequate to judge

175
00:10:00.261 --> 00:10:04.430
them keen and true want to become God for just that reason. True,

176
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:08.300
because she thinks she can unilaterally solve the world's problems and keen

177
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.540
extensively to re-establish the glory days of white supremacy.

178
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.630
Vites unilateral decision to save the world from nuclear.

179
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:19.100
Pocalypse is unknown to the world and thus not capable of being judged.

180
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.350
<v 2>I saved the world from nuclear Armageddon. John</v>

181
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.810
shy from you and select few,

182
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.193
but he knows.

183
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.920
<v 1>Two are the actions of captain metropolis, hooded justice, roar shack,</v>

184
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.580
or lube guy, a mask in the world of Watchman shields.

185
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.620
It's wearer from the judgment of others,

186
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.080
which makes judge recitation of the Latin phrase,

187
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:49.910
who watches the Watchman to his mass police force. So incredibly ironic, please.

188
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.830
<v 2>Custodian Ipsos, custodies.</v>

189
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:57.140
<v 1>Especially as they reply Sec,</v>

190
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.060
plops, conspiracy aside Watchman.

191
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:03.170
Isn't shy about how such a culture quickly leads to an out of control police,

192
00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:05.900
state, where torture and right lessness are the norm.

193
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.850
<v 2>Yeah, we really don't have to do that with terrorists.</v>

194
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.850
<v 1>When certain kinds of violence become embedded in the law,</v>

195
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.700
the state can effectively shield themselves from judgment.

196
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.380
Whether you're throwing someone in the trunk of.

197
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.690
<v 2>Your car, there's a guy in my trunk or.</v>

198
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.210
<v 1>Exploding people's heads on behalf of the federal government.</v>

199
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.320
But if hiding one's identity protects one from the judgment of their peers,

200
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.450
so can hiding one's history.

201
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.800
One of White's sources of power is his ability to hide his past crimes from the

202
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:36.560
public. He doesn't need a mask to avoid judgment,

203
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.530
but this idea isn't simply limited to Vite.

204
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.120
We learned through PDP via the supplementary HBO material as collected by agent

205
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:46.010
PD, that fog dancing,

206
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.150
a book vide reads in prison is about American soldiers who would dispose of

207
00:11:50.151 --> 00:11:51.980
evidence of American war crimes.

208
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.460
He claims he reads because it's about loneliness,

209
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.400
but maybe he relates to the themes of covering up one's crimes.

210
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:03.870
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

211
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.780
<v 1>If fight is hiding his history to avoid judgment,</v>

212
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.910
who or what else is to fully grasp that we have to look at watchman's

213
00:12:11.911 --> 00:12:15.330
one, true God, Dr. Manhattan, part two,

214
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.800
nothing ever ends while Dr. Manhattan isn't even seen until the penultimate

215
00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:23.730
episode, his worldview is critical to understand the show in episode eight,

216
00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:26.310
he explains his unique relationship to time.

217
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.100
It's not a flow of events from past to present,

218
00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:32.100
but something he experiences simultaneously. Hello.

219
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.430
<v 3>Ben for you 24 years,</v>

220
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.890
41 days and 13 hours for me it's happening right

221
00:12:40.891 --> 00:12:41.850
now. Yes, yes, sir.

222
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.471
<v 1>With this premise,</v>

223
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.100
the show cuts back and forth between the doctor's childhood fleeing the Nazis,

224
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.530
his meeting of Angela and their future together.

225
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.440
The show wants us to think about history like Dr.

226
00:12:52.441 --> 00:12:55.920
Manhattan without the idea of before I don't.

227
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.310
<v 3>Experience the concept of before.</v>

228
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.090
<v 1>In other words,</v>

229
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:04.560
a view of history in which nothing ever ends history is not dead but

230
00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:06.480
alive in our current moment.

231
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.410
And the show constantly explores how the past continues into the present.

232
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.100
We see the fictional events of the graphic novel trickle into every detail of

233
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:16.920
life in a nod to the final pages of the graphic novel,

234
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.100
Angela and her grandmother eat at a chain called burgers and Borsch,

235
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.090
a cultural melding made possible by the threat of extra dimensional annihilation

236
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.350
at a dinner party.

237
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.890
Kids make a game of reciting the U S presidents moving to where Watchman

238
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:29.221
history,

239
00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:33.420
diverges and Nixon never resigns and is succeeded by Gerald Ford and Robert

240
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.463
Redford.

241
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.110
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

242
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.790
<v 1>Relishes in the tiniest of details.</v>

243
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.630
Imagining that Steven Spielberg made Schindler's list, not about the Holocaust,

244
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.340
but about the giant squid attack.

245
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.110
<v 2>The move is black and white. So the red really pops, you know, um,</v>

246
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.920
and the girls stumbling around Harold square,

247
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.170
walking under the tenant calls. They do all the dead bodies

248
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.553
and she's scared.

249
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.100
<v 1>Or suggesting to the viewer that John Grisham has become a Supreme court</v>

250
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:15.510
justice. Of course, if the alternate history gives way to the alternate present.

251
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.080
So two does real history giveaway to the real present.

252
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.320
Aside from small Easter eggs, it cannot be understated.

253
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:26.100
The insane level of detail Watchman puts into thinking about history.

254
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.950
Blake sidekick PD has a PhD in history.

255
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.880
<v 2>I wrote my graduate thesis on the police strike of 77.</v>

256
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.600
<v 1>Will's wife. June is a reporter at the New York Amsterdam news.</v>

257
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.350
<v 2>Why are you writing?</v>

258
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.070
You still worried about me because the Amsterdam says a Negro cadet making the

259
00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:42.330
forces big news.

260
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.860
<v 1>One of new York's most influential and oldest African-American newspapers that</v>

261
00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:50.370
was especially active in covering the civil rights movement and Chronicle

262
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.830
derives of X lady true is named after the Vietnamese historical figure who

263
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:58.940
fought to resist the Chinese state of Eastern Wu as it occupied Vietnam and is

264
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:01.550
quoted by her mother when she steals vites seed.

265
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.683
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

266
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.350
<v 1>Events happen in a literal museum and the U S treasury secretary is real life</v>

267
00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:32.950
historian, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. And here we get back to Dr.

268
00:15:32.951 --> 00:15:37.000
Manhattan because justice Manhattan's experience of time seamlessly jumps from

269
00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:39.340
one moment in time to another. So too,

270
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:42.820
does the show like Manhattan laughing at a six month old joke?

271
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.070
<v 2>This Angela must be quite something six months ago.</v>

272
00:15:48.071 --> 00:15:51.040
She's telling me I have a fantastic imagination.

273
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.580
<v 1>The show interjects moments of history to show their connectedness.</v>

274
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.120
The show often juxtaposes similar objects from different times.

275
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.810
This is most explicitly done while Angela is overdosing on the stall. Jo,

276
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.560
as Angela remembers being given a badge by a Vietnamese police officer,

277
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.910
the show quickly cuts to the badge of bass reads in the 1920s to will Reeves

278
00:16:09.911 --> 00:16:13.690
receiving his badge over a decade later to the blood spattered badge of cheap

279
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.670
Crawford over half a century later,

280
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.670
when a police officer puts a sack over a suspect's head,

281
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.240
Angela flashes back to the memory of will putting on the sack from his almost

282
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.950
lynching, or as we'll read,

283
00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:28.540
sees a police car drive by two corpses from the Tulsa race massacre drag behind

284
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.160
through these techniques.

285
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.990
The show asks the viewer to consider past and present acts of racism as one

286
00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:36.280
continual legacy.

287
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.210
Other examples in the show are stretched out between episodes in Tulsa.

288
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.170
We see a Molotov cocktail thrown through a shop window and event that repeats

289
00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:48.430
itself years later at a Jewish deli Angela's makeup closely resemble hooded

290
00:16:48.431 --> 00:16:49.090
justices,

291
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:53.410
but it blackens her skin instead of a widening it and a racist bank ad we see

292
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:57.580
unveiled by captain metropolis is later hung in the seventh cavalry hideout,

293
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.440
much like the graphic novel.

294
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.240
The show uses the clock motif to ask the viewer to consider the idea of time and

295
00:17:04.241 --> 00:17:04.811
how not.

296
00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:09.250
Unlike a constructed watch is a series of meticulous cogs that create an

297
00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:13.990
illusory March from past to present this counterintuitive approach to

298
00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:18.280
time seems critical to one of watchman's biggest themes, historiography.

299
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.170
That is the writing of history,

300
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.910
but simply debates around historiography can let us ask questions like what is,

301
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:28.900
or was considered historically important enough to discuss in the first place.

302
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:33.070
A lot of history involves finding facts about individual events and discerning a

303
00:17:33.071 --> 00:17:36.250
narrative in them. And that's where things can get especially tricky.

304
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.570
So was the Holocaust some anomaly of European history or was the

305
00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:45.190
extermination of Jews gypsies and others deeply influenced by practices and

306
00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:50.070
ideologies birthed by Europeans as they colonized Africa as Hunter or rent

307
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.740
or other historians argue same event,

308
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.130
different story watchman's own show within a show,

309
00:17:56.131 --> 00:18:00.510
American hero story like the comics novel within a novel under the hood serves

310
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:02.670
as a reminder of what happens to history.

311
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:07.470
When sensationalism meets an utter disregard for the truth PDs complaints about

312
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:09.360
its accuracy aside that show.

313
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.390
<v 2>It was garbage it's there it's full of historical.</v>

314
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.220
<v 1>It manages to tell the story of hooded justice while glibly ignoring the lack of</v>

315
00:18:19.221 --> 00:18:22.130
information about the person behind the mask. In this case,

316
00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:26.450
what the show portrays is a fun romp of a robbery busting was actually a black

317
00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:29.450
man fighting the clan to drive the point home the same,

318
00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:34.100
more or less placed in reverse hinting. How the show got it in historical terms,

319
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.413
backwards,

320
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.200
rest fictional hooded justice breaks into the store from the window to save the

321
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.730
day from some nameless thugs.

322
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.420
The real hooded justice jumped out the window when fleeing from a prominent

323
00:18:44.421 --> 00:18:47.180
white supremacist, much of the history of Watchman,

324
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.770
like its fictional critique of American hero story focuses on exactly what's

325
00:18:51.771 --> 00:18:56.120
been forgotten or deliberately ignored in the mainstream writing of real

326
00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:59.870
American history throughout the show were presented with events in newspaper

327
00:18:59.871 --> 00:19:00.261
clippings.

328
00:19:00.261 --> 00:19:03.950
That one might easily dismiss as part of the show's intricate mythology,

329
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.410
but time after time, they're not,

330
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.070
they actually happen who to justice has pinned up articles,

331
00:19:10.071 --> 00:19:14.750
declaring Nazis March through streets of long Island and 22,000 Nazis hold

332
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:16.370
rally in Madison square garden.

333
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.850
The latter being a reference to the German American Bund rally in New York.

334
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.140
The insinuation is that support for Nazi-ism and America is intricately linked

335
00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:28.220
to the fictional Cyclops with its white supremacist mission. Of course,

336
00:19:28.221 --> 00:19:30.290
many people have discussed the show's opening,

337
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.050
which portrays the event of the Tulsa race massacre,

338
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.650
where America's wealthiest black neighborhood was destroyed by a mob of white

339
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.990
Tulsa. As NBC reported.

340
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.440
Many people were surprised to learn that this was in fact real,

341
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:47.450
as it is not often discussed in most history textbooks. Even the small details,

342
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.960
the presence of black GIS who had served in world war one in Tulsa and the

343
00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:54.650
bombing by airplanes are all historically accurate. Later,

344
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:58.760
we see German propaganda during world war one that asks black GIS why they would

345
00:19:58.761 --> 00:20:01.430
fight for a country in which they were second class citizens.

346
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.350
<v 2>Do you enjoy the same rights as two white people in America</v>

347
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.070
treated as second class citizens.

348
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.911
<v 1>The leaflet,</v>

349
00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:17.750
which a young William finds in his father's coat reflects real German propaganda

350
00:20:17.751 --> 00:20:21.950
from the time what's more a newspaper on the ground bears the real headline from

351
00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:24.200
the Tulsa Tribune in the lead up to the massacre.

352
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.490
The article even makes its way to modern day as a scene in the Greenwood museum.

353
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.120
The museum is helmed, not only by a prominent historian,

354
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.990
but a man who sparked a national outrage about racial profiling after being

355
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:39.950
arrested for breaking into his own home. There's a pretty fitting moment.

356
00:20:39.951 --> 00:20:43.640
When will Reeves confronts Judd about the Klan robe in his closet? Again,

357
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.190
the history is no accident. The clan often collaborated police departments,

358
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.050
especially during the civil rights era.

359
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.780
<v 2>The Klan had helped elect a white racist named Eugene bull Connor as</v>

360
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.333
Birmingham's police chief.

361
00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.570
<v 1>In Florida. For instance,</v>

362
00:20:57.571 --> 00:21:02.220
the FBI knew too that in the 1940s and fifties County sheriffs

363
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:06.840
openly joined the clan writes Gilbert King in his book devil in the Grove during

364
00:21:06.841 --> 00:21:08.160
the Tulsa massacre itself,

365
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.390
some police officers straight up deputized members of the Lynch mob. Of course,

366
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.810
the regular involvement of police departments with Lynch mobs in the clan are

367
00:21:15.811 --> 00:21:20.460
simultaneously either ignored or in Judd's case part of his heritage.

368
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:25.290
I have a right to keep it. It's my legacy to which William replies.

369
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.250
And you should feel proud of your legacy, what you hide it.

370
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.740
Goodbye America's history has been shielded from judgment. Alan Moore though.

371
00:21:34.741 --> 00:21:38.730
He's had sharp words against the HBO show has made similar statements about the

372
00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:43.470
history of masked heroes saying a good argument can be made for DW Griffith's

373
00:21:43.471 --> 00:21:47.670
birth of a nation as the first American superhero movie and the point of origin

374
00:21:47.671 --> 00:21:50.310
for all those capes and masks Griffith's film,

375
00:21:50.311 --> 00:21:54.450
which glorified the clan is credited with helping the rebirth of the KKK in

376
00:21:54.451 --> 00:21:57.150
America. Then of course there's the more subtle,

377
00:21:57.151 --> 00:22:00.120
or maybe just coincidental historical parallels,

378
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.380
the Cyclops mesmerism encourages African-Americans to harm and hate each other.

379
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.490
<v 2>To any white man woman or child.</v>

380
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.530
<v 1>It seems like a loose fictionalization of the idea as argued by thinker,</v>

381
00:22:16.531 --> 00:22:21.060
bell hooks that the entire world of advertising and mass media in general,

382
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.070
which sends both the covert and overt message that blackness is negative is part

383
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.290
of the propaganda machinery of shaming.

384
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.620
The seven cavalry members live in a place called Nixon bill,

385
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.120
obviously after the president,

386
00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:36.480
but Nixon might be of specific importance to the show's fascination with

387
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:37.230
history.

388
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.980
Whereas pandering to white racists was a favorite pastime of Democrats like

389
00:22:40.981 --> 00:22:44.820
George Wallace Nixon and his political allies were able to rest votes from the

390
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:47.940
traditionally Democrat voting South to the Republican party.

391
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.140
I stirring up racist fears and white voters to quote Nixon strategist,

392
00:22:52.141 --> 00:22:56.520
Kevin Phillips in 1970, the more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South,

393
00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.570
the sooner the Negro folk whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans.

394
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.950
That's where the votes are.

395
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.280
The idea that the seventh cavalry are not some modern anomaly,

396
00:23:05.281 --> 00:23:09.660
but the product of specific history is further driven home by smaller details.

397
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.530
Their name derives from the U S army regiment famously commanded by general

398
00:23:13.531 --> 00:23:16.380
Custer during the great Sioux war of 1876,

399
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.430
a war brought on by America's desire for gold and native American territory.

400
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.160
At one point Judd even sends a pager message,

401
00:23:23.161 --> 00:23:26.850
reading a little big horn in reference to Custer's famous last stand.

402
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.540
The idea that they're driven by the historical legacy of manifest destiny and

403
00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:34.770
white supremacy in America is furthered with small details like the painting

404
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.970
marshal feats of Comanche horsemanship, uh, George Catlin, painting that in PD,

405
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:44.160
pedia we learn was given by Senator King to remind Jud how formidable our Savage

406
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.180
enemies can be.

407
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.830
The philosophy of Watchman might just be coyly written right there in the

408
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:51.380
episode four title. If you don't like my story,

409
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.910
write your own borrowing from a quote from author chin watch habit it's worth

410
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:59.360
mentioning a Chavez famous novel things fall apart is about the arrival of

411
00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:03.080
European colonizers in Nigeria. A chubby has scholar.

412
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:07.100
John Tema notes was interested in recuperating the image of Africa in contrast

413
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:09.200
to European writers like Joseph Conrad,

414
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:13.700
who portrayed it as a place of savagery and barbarism through the character of

415
00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:14.181
Angela.

416
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:17.720
We see watchman's approach to history as she learns the truth of her past and

417
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:19.460
how it is deeply affected her.

418
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.780
Her whole journey is as will describes it to learn where she came from.

419
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.820
<v 2>Good morning to meet you and show you what you came.</v>

420
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.270
<v 1>She not only has to grapple with the trauma that defines her,</v>

421
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:35.260
but how bad trauma seems rooted in her genealogy in a different episode.

422
00:24:35.261 --> 00:24:38.190
Lady true tells to farmers that legacy isn't is.

423
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.120
<v 2>It's in blood passed to us from our ancestors and bias.</v>

424
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.920
<v 1>Angela learns that the legacy she inherited was that of a granddaughter of a</v>

425
00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:50.050
Tulsa massacre survivor elsewhere.

426
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.480
We're told about genetic trauma in a support group.

427
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.570
<v 2>There's this thing, genetic drama.</v>

428
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.240
<v 1>While these psychic squid mass murder is fictional.</v>

429
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.440
The concept of genetic trauma is the real and ongoing hypothesis that stressful

430
00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:09.310
or traumatic experiences might alter the genetic expression of their children.

431
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.640
Small studies of the children of Holocaust survivors. For instance,

432
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.100
it's just biological changes in their children,

433
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.270
but if squid survivors can beget their trauma to their kin in watchman's eyes.

434
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.120
So to can the victims of racist violence,

435
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.210
when Angela fully learns her history by taking the stall jet,

436
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.940
it almost breaks her mind, but by the end,

437
00:25:27.941 --> 00:25:32.230
Angela learns not to suppress her personal trauma as will explains.

438
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.473
<v 2>Anger</v>

439
00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.500
under a mask. Angela.

440
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.390
<v 1>And what about Angela's heavily implied apotheosis for a show fixated on the</v>

441
00:26:10.391 --> 00:26:13.150
monstrous deeds of characters trying to become God.

442
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.910
It seems strange to have the protagonist become one,

443
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.740
but if we think back to time,

444
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.550
one of the shows primary motifs and how Dr. Manhattan experiences it,

445
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.310
maybe Angela's arc is to experience the past,

446
00:26:24.311 --> 00:26:29.050
present and future as one to understand as the show reminds us that

447
00:26:29.051 --> 00:26:32.050
nothing ever ends. But what do you think wise crack,

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.310
