<v 0>This video is brought to you by surf shark, VPN.</v>

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.433
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.333
<v 0>Greg here,</v>

4
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.900
ready to have a most resplendent time talking about a film with the best

5
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:16.850
dialogue in the history of cinema.

6
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.370
<v 1>Billy, the kid he's famous, dude.</v>

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.643
That's bad.

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.910
<v 0>Bill and Ted's excellent.</v>

9
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:30.530
Adventure is frequently dismissed as a silly teen flag about two stone arrests

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.430
metal heads, who would literally rather do anything than go to school.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.600
But what if it's secretly a genius film about the radical power of learning?

12
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.320
<v 2>No way, no way.</v>

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.710
<v 0>Well, maybe way dude, maybe way, dude.</v>

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.240
Let's find out as bill and Ted's excellent. Adventure is deep are dumb.

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.040
We swear we'll be.

16
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.503
<v 1>No.</v>

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.040
<v 0>Or maybe the opposite anyway,</v>

18
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.020
spoilers and a most triumphant time ahead. But before we get into it,

19
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.560

Now back to the show.

35
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.580
Now a quick recap bill and Ted centers on two pleasant metal heads were

36
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:11.120
remarkable only in the fact that they are the future saviors of the world.

37
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.820
Except right now they're about to flunk history,

38
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.790
which will get young Kiana Reed sent to military school.

39
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.770
<v 2>Failed history. You flunk out of school. You know what that would mean?</v>

40
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:26.600
Don't you tit that I would have to go to oats, military Academy.

41
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.480
<v 0>And destroy the dual SIG ban.</v>

42
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.560
Their only means of salvation give a killer oral report on an apparently random

43
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:38.660
assortment of historical time periods.

44
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.440
Just when all hope seems lost and Kiano might have to open a bug.

45
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.060
A guy named Rufus from the future shows up with a dope time traveling phone

46
00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:48.230
booth. They use it,

47
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.060
the kidnap historical figures bring them to the present and AC out of that

48
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:58.010
presentation as resolved our dudes on track to save the world so long

49
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:02.530
as they can learn to play instruments. First, the end. So good. This time,

50
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:07.090
traveling stone affair possibly be deeper than the sofa eyes of one.

51
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.650
Mr. Reeves, we got two arguments to throw at you. Here's number one,

52
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.150
bill and Ted might be all about the failures of Western style education.

53
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.050
It's no secret that these dudes do not care about their own learning.

54
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.830
<v 2>Oh, we're late for what.</v>

55
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.900
<v 0>The classroom is presented as a place where facts are to be memorized and</v>

56
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:31.470
regurgitated. Not only is this a very boring way to learn.

57
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.200
It's also a really big societal problem.

58
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.180
According to the educator and philosopher,

59
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.540
Paolo Ferreri and his banking concept of education.

60
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.250
Crary argued that the Western education functions under the premise that the

61
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:48.750
teacher knows everything important and the student functionally knows nothing

62
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.980
as education is there for something to be given from the teacher to the student,

63
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.030
the positive like coins until your dumb old piggy bank of a brain.

64
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.410
According to [inaudible],

65
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.790
the result is that the scope of action allowed to the students extends only as

66
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:06.840
far as receiving, filing and storing the deposits.

67
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.360
This is visible right away and bill and Ted's. Well,

68
00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:13.800
we see the chalkboard of a social studies classroom filled with a short list of

69
00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:18.600
historical time periods waiting to be systematically deposited into these

70
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:21.270
impressionable minds bill and Ted's teacher.

71
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:25.770
Doesn't ask them to argue about the possible causes of world war one or

72
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.680
theorizing powder winds were good for ed baggy.

73
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.820
He asked him to recite admittedly, very simple facts.

74
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.890
<v 2>With Joan of arc Noah's wife.</v>

75
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.870
<v 0>Rory who spent his life educating impoverished disenfranchised folks in Brazil</v>

76
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.350
believed the banking model to be inherently oppressive.

77
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.680
Treating students like adaptable, manageable beings.

78
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.670
You feel someone's brain with random facts and make sure that they don't have

79
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:58.320
the will or ability to think critically about those facts. And from there,

80
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.170
you don't have to worry about anyone changing the world,

81
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.120
whether through a mass protest movement or weirdly influential metal

82
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.940
bed. And this is a problem with normal school.

83
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.420
It certainly dialed up to 11 and military school,

84
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.340
an institution built to teach kids that shout out and listen to authority and

85
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:18.174
federally.

86
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.040
It's the prospect of Ted leaving wild stallions to become a cadet mindlessly

87
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:27.990
doing burpees that threatens the very rad utopia that all boy Rufus was

88
00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:29.040
sent to protect.

89
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.570
But how do you overcome the drone minded nature of education banking according

90
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:37.530
to [inaudible] you do so by becoming an add to participant in your learning

91
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.670
specifically,

92
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.710
Fraley believed in the power of problem posing education in which the teacher

93
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:47.700
enters a dialogue with the students, rendering all participants,

94
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.010
jointly responsible for a process in which all grow Kyla,

95
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:55.680
like a teacher who encourages you to argue with them about George Washington's

96
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.600
farewell address instead of quizzing you about what year he crossed the

97
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.434
Delaware.

98
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.460
And problem posing seems at least a bit similar to what's happening between

99
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:05.780
Rufus and bill and Ted.

100
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.200
They're not too dumdums for him to fill with information.

101
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.820
He approaches them with reverence and respect. Although, admittedly,

102
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.740
my guy is in a real weird spot because he both has to help them and

103
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.720
worship them as savings of the world.

104
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.110
Rufus shows them the time machine teaches them how to use it.

105
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.220
<v 2>That book will give you the number of any place you want.</v>

106
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.410
<v 0>To go and explains this implications.</v>

107
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.890
<v 2>These are the circuits of history. Gentlemen even.</v>

108
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.420
<v 0>Gives a little historical background, Australia.</v>

109
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.380
<v 2>1805, the friendship just invaded, but.</v>

110
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.050
<v 0>Then he leaves them to their own devices. Gentlemen.</v>

111
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.843
<v 2>On your own.</v>

112
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.840
<v 0>Bill and Ted now must pursue a more active educational model,</v>

113
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.310
essentially rounding up a crew of historical figures to become their substitute

114
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:55.300
teachers along the way they creatively solve various issues.

115
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:59.830
They encounter ranging from broken antennas to figuring out how to get in touch

116
00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:02.020
with the medieval begs of their dreams.

117
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.420
How are we going to meet him key to the problem?

118
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:08.710
Posing educational style for every said is communication.

119
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.070
As he put it authentic thinking,

120
00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:15.340
thinking that is concerned about reality does not take place in ivory tower

121
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:19.090
isolation, but only in communication by communication.

122
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:22.750
We can only hope that Freddie was imagining this glorious exchange.

123
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.290
Our boys have over Socrates writing just before me.

124
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.910
<v 2>The only true wisdom, consistent knowing that you know nothing.</v>

125
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.660
That's us.

126
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.320
<v 0>Dude.</v>

127
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.790
What's more bill and Ted immediately enter a dialogue with Socrates

128
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.620
aura show crates,

129
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.040
sharing their own wisdom gleaned from growing up in the eighties.

130
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.970
<v 2>All we are is dust in the wind.</v>

131
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.160
Dude just

132
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.600
went, dude.

133
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.160
<v 0>Which appropriately blows this Athenians mind over the course of their journey</v>

134
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.770
instead of simply memorizing Joan of arc name,

135
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.120
they'll learn about her youthful achievements instead of memorizing Sigmund

136
00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:11.890
Freud's theory of adipocyte complex Ted undergoes analysis by the good

137
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:14.800
doctor, perhaps most importantly,

138
00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:18.640
bill and Ted are empowered with the knowledge that they have a tremendous effect

139
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:21.460
over the history. They all our saviors,

140
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.020
after all this notion of a student's active role in the making of history,

141
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.580
couldn't possibly be more antithetical to the feeling you get when memorizing

142
00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:35.500
facts about Alexander, the great as fairy puddle problem, posing education,

143
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.150
train students in the art of how to see the world, not as a static reality,

144
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.980
but as a reality and process and transformation while [inaudible] was talking

145
00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:49.420
about empowering people to think they can change the present are their own

146
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:50.440
circumstances.

147
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.060
This film little in lies is that I did by making bill and Ted actually

148
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.940
of change in the future.

149
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.140
As they learn how to control the forces around them and harness that power to

150
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.580
help them achieve their goals.

151
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.380
And you can almost see what ferry calls the emergence of consciousness and

152
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.600
critical intervention. In reality.

153
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.470
<v 3>The report will time travel back to two days ago,</v>

154
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.820
steal your dad's keys and leave.

155
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.120
<v 0>In a weird or perhaps slightly metaphorical way.</v>

156
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.260
Bill and Ted are taking charge of their own education and along the way,

157
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.100
discovering their own agency and even learning something.

158
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.880
<v 3>Is sometimes known as the father of modern diet.</v>

159
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.640
He was the teacher of Plato who was in turn,

160
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.970
the teacher of Aristotle and like Ozzy Osborne,

161
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.390
which repeatedly accused of corruption of the yacht.

162
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.290
<v 0>Now, when I first heard this idea, I thought, Oh, hell no, come on.</v>

163
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.910
This movie is dumb as hell.

164
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.660
And maybe it's a stretch to compare stoner bros.

165
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.890
The kids rising up against the government in South America. But I got to say,

166
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.540
I'm pretty convinced on this one.

167
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.740
So convinced I'm going to rate this argument pretty deep,

168
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.430
but now we've got to get to the real wild stuff. Argument. Number two,

169
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.480
here's the pitch,

170
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.380
not only is this movie about the failures of our education system,

171
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.880
but it's also an exploration of the shortcomings of the written word itself.

172
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.140
it all right. To get to the bottom of this,

173
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.090
we need to look at the dichotomy between an all versus a literary society.

174
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:25.280
I E one dominated by what comes out of your mouth hole or is received by our

175
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:29.840
ear holes versus one dominated by what you read via your aisles

176
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.940
and right bill and Ted begins in the modern world where the written word

177
00:10:34.941 --> 00:10:38.960
reign Supreme, we all met around society through and through,

178
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.170
but they are punished for their refusal to, you know,

179
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.860
read and learn fixed facts about history correctly,

180
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.600
thus leading them to eminent academic failure. However,

181
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.850
bill and Ted are the absolute embodiment of a burgeoning oral culture giving

182
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.700
their tendency to communicate via song and music.

183
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.330
Even when this score with futuristic weirdos, according to scholar,

184
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.560
landline quiz,

185
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.450
the way history functions in an oral versus literary society is critical to

186
00:11:11.451 --> 00:11:14.840
understanding bill and Ted in a literary society.

187
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.850
Lonquist explains historical narratives are fixed, rigid and unchangeable.

188
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.080
After all,

189
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.460
you can't change the printed word in a normal society where storytellers can

190
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:26.540
adapt each story,

191
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:31.370
a song to suit their audiences left reign Supreme.

192
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.110
Like how home is Odyssey is likely a combination of several different enduring

193
00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:41.000
stories told from generation to generation in ancient Greece that eventually

194
00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:42.020
got written down.

195
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.060
What's more liberal societies tend to be more equal because it's LUN

196
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.133
Quintz explains.

197
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.030
The written word was historically weaponized by the powerful to deny rights,

198
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.700
the illiterate masses and contrast oral traditions like folk

199
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.480
songs or folklore are accessible to just about everyone.

200
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.190
Maybe it's a weird coincidence,

201
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:08.050
but just about every literary society we visit in Billington is violent and

202
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:12.580
cruel. While all based societies like Athens are presented as peaceful.

203
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.420
<v 3>It was most tranquil. And also.</v>

204
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:21.060
<v 0>They kidnapped Socrates who was one of the last philosophers of ancient Greece</v>

205
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.350
that we know of to communicate solely through oral tradition.

206
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.760
He also famously feared that reading and writing would cause the downfall of

207
00:12:29.761 --> 00:12:30.630
civilization.

208
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.070
The only reason we think we know what kind of stuff Socrates said is because his

209
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.300
student Plato wrote a bunch of it down and keep them with this bill.

210
00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:44.040
And Ted seemed to epitomize the egalitarian nature of an oral society.

211
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.630
When cramming for their tests,

212
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.610
they solicit the conversational anecdotal help of various patrons

213
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.820
of the circle, K and keeping with classic oral.

214
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.100
<v 3>The lady in that car over there said that Marco polo was in the year 1275.</v>

215
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.420
<v 0>And critically their teacher perhaps sensing their resistance to literary</v>

216
00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:04.200
culture,

217
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.760
throws our boys a bone and offers them the chance to pass via

218
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.280
adult presentation.

219
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.570
Prairie might extra appreciate the fact that this presentation is structured

220
00:13:15.571 --> 00:13:19.200
around the idea of communication and critical thinking.

221
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:24.330
Bill and tad must explain what various historical figures might bank and say

222
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.140
about their present day. World love San Demas,

223
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.130
which brings us to the other primary tension, myth versus history.

224
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.880
Whereas the history they learn in school is fixed and rigid,

225
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.420
made up of dates and hard to memorize facts, bill.

226
00:13:39.421 --> 00:13:43.980
And Ted's a historical mission to bring figures of the past into the present is

227
00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:47.610
the very stuff of myth-making by collecting Joan of arc,

228
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.910
Napoleon and crew, bill and tan are tearing apart.

229
00:13:50.911 --> 00:13:54.990
The history that our literary society is so obsessed with sure.

230
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.380
They absorb actual facts along their interactive history lessons.

231
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.600
<v 3>Nah, just got a minor Oedipal complex.</v>

232
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.670
<v 0>But they also use this new knowledge to draw a historical comparisons.</v>

233
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:09.900
<v 3>Time.</v>

234
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.440
When much of the world looked like the cover of the lead chaplain album houses

235
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.130
of the whole.

236
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.630
<v 0>They even called Socrates, the Ozzy Osborne of Athens underscoring.</v>

237
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.170
What luck was caused the collapse of historical context,

238
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.530
taking place in favor of a more mythical style,

239
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.540
less concerned with literal truth.

240
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.760
What's more as Lonquist explains bill and Ted's myth telling unlike

241
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:37.050
rigid history can be customized to fit their audience of San demons,

242
00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:41.190
high schoolers, nowhere more fittingly than in this moment.

243
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.220
<v 1>X to each other.</v>

244
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:50.963
Hardy on.

245
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.300
<v 0>The evidence of bill and Ted is champions of an oral society is telegraphed.</v>

246
00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.500
When we see the future,

247
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.490
a place that has been changed by the power of bill and Ted's music,

248
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.540
where the words they have said in the past have been carried down across

249
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:08.374
generations.

250
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.100
Now I'm not entirely convinced, but my uncle was more,

251
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.990
she argues that the film sequel bill and Ted's bogus journey, further champions,

252
00:15:19.991 --> 00:15:21.100
all society,

253
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.330
bill and Ted have apparently established a university where students learn

254
00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:29.950
orally via headphones and through interactive lessons with historical

255
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.290
thickest, once more, the movies,

256
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.130
Dylan who wants to change history and dethrone bill and Ted as the world

257
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.630
saviors, I wise his diabolical plan in a book,

258
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.520
a book that he makes people read and calls the new history. Once again,

259
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.020
literary society is clearly the enemy of our favorite metal head duo.

260
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.580
Nan pays me a little bit to imagine a society where literature doesn't matter,

261
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.320
but I got to give it the lung lung is man.

262
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.590
The all versus written society bed is a little convincing.

263
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.450
I'm not saying that bill and Ted is intentionally saying all this. However,

264
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.580
we do think that the series maybe inadvertently makes a most

265
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.040
excellent argument about the power of active,

266
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:16.480
empowered learning in primarily all societies at the same time,

267
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.190
it majorly tampons,

268
00:16:18.191 --> 00:16:22.450
the power of myths and helping us better understand the world and our place in

269
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:25.390
it. Why there, where the salaries of humanity are not.

270
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.440
And so in our final moments is bill and Ted deep are,

271
00:16:29.441 --> 00:16:32.350
is it as dumb as an infinite loop of Keanu Reeves saying.

272
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.143
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

273
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.960
<v 0>Raise your 10th grade American history teacher and write this take on this film</v>

274
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.690
surprisingly incredibly deep,

275
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.600
but what do you guys think as wild stallions rotted?

276
00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:50.020
Our brains are as there really a lot more going on in this film,

277
00:16:50.021 --> 00:16:53.920
