<v 0>This video is brought to you by Skillshare.</v>

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.450
<v 1>Internet people. Jared,</v>

3
00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:12.050
here it's been years since DC unveiled their expanded cinematic universe,

4
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:16.250
but unfortunately these days we can't think of Batman or Superman without

5
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:19.850
getting a little bit sad or very, very sad. Yeah.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.713
<v 0>Darkness.</v>

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.480
<v 1>So today we're going to face that sadness together and take a look at the big</v>

8
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:31.040
question to end all big questions. What the hell went wrong with the DCEU?

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.380
Sure you can point to standalone successes.

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.340
People seem to like Aquaman wonder woman was pretty good, but unlike Marvel,

11
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:39.990
which managed to make over 20 movies with only a few.

12
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.450
<v 0>Thinkers DCS.</v>

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.300
<v 1>And the missions seem to have crashed and burned.</v>

14
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.260
How could such a sure thing turn out so disappointing the way we see it,

15
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:55.430
the problems can be traced back to two comics from 1986 and the mismanaged

16
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.340
influence they've had on superhero culture at large,

17
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.880
allow us to explain welcome to this wisecrack edition on the DCU,

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.660
what went wrong. And of course weather's a head for all the films in the DCU,

19
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:09.530
as well as slight spoilers for some excellent comics. But before we get into it,

20
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:10.670
I want to give a shout out to this week.

21
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:14.510
Sponsors Skillshare Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of

22
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:18.170
inspiring classes for creative and curious people with skill share.

23
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.350
You can explore new skills and learn more about your passions all from the

24
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.830
comfort of your own home. Right now, the world can seem very hectic,

25
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:27.230
but channeling your energy into doing something productive,

26
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:30.650
like learning a new skill can be a great way to relieve stress.

27
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.330
One class I recommend is everyday minimalism find common creativity in simple

28
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:36.560
living by Erin Boyle.

29
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.130
It's the perfect class to take in these times when everyone is trying to live

30
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:43.940
simply cheaply and find a sense of calm while being productive.

31
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.300
Aaron will teach you how to navigate stressful situations and how to make the

32
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:49.430
best with less. Not more.

33
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.150
Each Skillshare class comes with a discussion board and resources for you to

34
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:55.490
complete projects in tandem with the class.

35
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.270
It feels great to focus on something that isn't the news and stay connected with

36
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:02.420
the community of people who will provide support and encouragement.

37
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.270
A premium annual membership is less than $10 a month.

38
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.210
And right now the first 1000 wise crack fans to click the link in the

39
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:12.650
description can get a two month free trial. And now back to the show,

40
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.940
let's dive in. Now, of course, the DCU isn't over per se,

41
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.880
parts of it are even getting rebooted with definite articles,

42
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:21.620
such as these suicide squad.

43
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.180
And I highly anticipated the Batman still at a time when superhero franchises

44
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.930
are the biggest movies in the world, characters like cyborg flash,

45
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.460
and most egregiously Superman have seemingly disappeared to be fair.

46
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.080
It's not for lack of trying,

47
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.710
but there were fundamental issues with their plans from the very beginning to

48
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:40.700
make sense of those issues.

49
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:44.390
We first need to understand Superman and Batman and what they represent.

50
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.120
Two different versions of pure wish fulfillment,

51
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.700
not only in terms of putting on a Cape and fighting crime,

52
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:50.690
which would be awesome,

53
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.590
but in terms of the way they make us think about human potential Superman and

54
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:59.180
all his God-like power reflects what we wish we could be. He's by definition,

55
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.940
more than human. He is the fantasy of being freed from our physical limitations.

56
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.470
Batman on the other hand made himself who he is through drive will

57
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.080
persistence and a sizeable inheritance.

58
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.810
He pushed himself to the absolute extremes of human capability. In other words,

59
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:20.370
he's what we know we could be if we applied ourselves and maybe how to Butler

60
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.350
heroes also differ greatly in their psychology. Batman is irrevocably flawed,

61
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.000
no matter how hard he tries or how many billions he punches never get over the

62
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.500
tragic death of his parents.

63
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.590
And that's led him on a personal crusade against crime.

64
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.570
He is constantly engaged in the struggle too,

65
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.560
do the right thing because essentially there's not much separating him from the

66
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:41.760
villains he faces.

67
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.110
The key way that he does distinguish himself is in one clear unbreakable rule.

68
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.250
He will not kill lest. He become like the mugger who murdered his parents,

69
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.360
Superman for all his unearthly power is a rural farm boy at heart.

70
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.070
He isn't driven by trauma.

71
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.940
He simply believes that he has a moral and ethical duty to use his power to

72
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:04.020
help. He was raised to know about lying that you shouldn't harm other people.

73
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.420
And that honest work is more than good enough.

74
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.260
He doesn't generally involve himself in geopolitics or governmental policy

75
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.480
because he doesn't see it as his place.

76
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.110
He never uses more force than is necessary at his core.

77
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:20.010
He embodies everything good noble about the human spirit through this.

78
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:23.160
He reinforces faith in our values and provides hope.

79
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.100
At least these are your stakes, Batman and Superman.

80
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.480
Different artists have imagined Superman as a communist or Batman as a vampire,

81
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.500
but the way our two favorite superheroes I manifested in the DCEU as helmed by

82
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.550
Zach Snyder can directly trace their influence back to two specific works that

83
00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:42.900
take a unique approach to heroics Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons Watchman and Frank

84
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:44.490
Miller's. The dark Knight returns.

85
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.270
Both of these comics were revolutionary when they debuted in 1986 because they

86
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:52.740
subverted and deconstructed so many superhero tropes by placing them within a

87
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.240
real world context,

88
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.840
both Watchman and the dark Knight returns pick apart the kind of society that

89
00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:01.440
would necessitate superheroes and the kind of people that would be drawn toward

90
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.370
the superhero life.

91
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.420
They critique the very concepts of super heroics and vigilantism as well as the

92
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.510
effects that they would have on the world. Watchman took a wide view of the,

93
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.010
as a whole using newly created characters to represent the archetypes present in

94
00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:15.630
superhero fiction, the comedian,

95
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:19.170
a stand in for flag wearing patriotic heroes like captain America,

96
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.150
gleefully quell, social unrest,

97
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.170
and commits atrocities in Vietnam can tend to be a tool for the government.

98
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.150
The all-powerful Dr. Manhattan mirrors,

99
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:31.380
all the unimaginably powerful heroes like Superman at captain Adam or silver

100
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:31.890
surfer,

101
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.310
but Manhattan's ultimate power leads to an increasing disconnect from the human

102
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:36.144
condition,

103
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.390
thereby questioning the fundamental humanity of this type of super being,

104
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.380
which tacitly leads us to consider what connects characters like Superman to

105
00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:47.610
people like us and the kind of cold logic and greater good mentality that

106
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:51.780
characters like Batman so often fall into also comes into question with

107
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:56.460
Ozymandias is squid based master plan to unite the world under a common enemy by

108
00:05:56.461 --> 00:06:00.650
killing. This brings the very notion of heroism itself into question,

109
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.080
pushing us to examine our own moral concepts of justice and good gadget,

110
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:08.380
loving detectives, obsessive crusaders, the leg, see hero,

111
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.040
all of these archetypes and more are expertly folded into a handful of

112
00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:13.210
characters. However,

113
00:06:13.211 --> 00:06:18.070
as we've seen more still treats them as real people with complex psychology.

114
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.010
None of them are truly good or truly bad.

115
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.470
Whereas Watchman looks at the entire genre.

116
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.370
The dark Knight returns hones in on a single figure. Batman,

117
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.810
it imagines a much older caped Crusader who has aged in real time issuing the

118
00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:35.080
then unchallenged convention of [inaudible] comic book heroes.

119
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.840
We see the Batman Robin dynamic in a new light too,

120
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.610
with Batman characterizing the series of Robins that have as soldiers in this

121
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:44.320
telling the death of the second Robin,

122
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.070
Jason Todd was the biggest factor in Batman's decision to retire.

123
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.640
But when he fails to quell his crime fighting urges and dawns the Cape in

124
00:06:51.641 --> 00:06:52.474
collagen,

125
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.050
he is more than willing to take another impressionable child under his wing.

126
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.040
This directly addresses the inherent irresponsibility of Batman in regards to

127
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:04.150
enlisting children and teenagers into his hyper violent war on crime Miller.

128
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:07.630
Also reappraisals the mythic perpetual struggle between Batman and the Jews.

129
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.080
Here are the joker has been pretty much comatose since Batman retired,

130
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.720
confined to Arkham and seemingly compliant.

131
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.400
But after man returns to Gotham the joker to resurfaces to continue their feud

132
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.430
Miller paints their conflict as an effect of Batman's presence,

133
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.910
suggesting that maybe it was Batman himself who caused crime to evolve into

134
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.200
super crime and the stakes to be irreversibly raised in Gotham city Miller also

135
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.660
features Superman as a naive ignorant yes, man,

136
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:34.510
for the government who wages a climactic battle against Batman,

137
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.680
essentially because the president said so overall Watchman and the dark Knight

138
00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:42.640
returns broke new ground in the development of superheroes and were heralded for

139
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:44.530
their sofa were critiques of the genre.

140
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.610
But as revolutionary as they were both books come to somewhat pessimistic

141
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:51.940
conclusions about superheroes. Let's simply they're grim,

142
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.100
grimy and hella cynical.

143
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.730
They both feature the governmental regulation and prohibition of superheroes.

144
00:07:57.731 --> 00:07:58.564
For example,

145
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.810
suggesting that the natural response to super beings would be military

146
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:05.890
application and they both paint heroes as psychologically compromised,

147
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.220
driven by neuroses and disorders. Unfortunately,

148
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:12.940
the comics industry didn't really get this after the massive critical and

149
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:15.550
commercial success of Watchman in the dark Knight returns,

150
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.570
everyone tripped over themselves to mimic the grim and dark aesthetic of these

151
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:21.160
two revolutions. Mary works,

152
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.300
but their imitation was only surface level and led to what is known as the dark

153
00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:27.130
age of comics. Suddenly everything,

154
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.670
everything had to be dark and gritty and superheroes turned into poles who

155
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:31.451
killed villains.

156
00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:35.920
Indiscriminately optimism was seen to be cheesy replaced with baseless,

157
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.330
exed, blood Gore and rampant over sexualization was everywhere,

158
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.340
but seemingly just for the aesthetic,

159
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.790
without the nuance and complexity of Watchman and the dark Knight returns,

160
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.250
the stories were ultimately hollow.

161
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.200
Enter Zack Snyder before Snyder was becoming known as the comic book guy in

162
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:53.920
Hollywood,

163
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.680
mostly due to his faithful of Watchman and during the press for Watchman

164
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.970
Snyder, lauded to comics over all others, Watchman duh,

165
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.200
and the dark Knight returns even mentioning his desire to adapt the latter for

166
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:07.740
film.

167
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.790
And here's where we get into the real meat as to why the DCEU fell flat on its

168
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.420
face.

169
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.870
The same cynical deconstruction that worked for Watchman and the dark Knight

170
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:20.490
returns seem to inform every decision Snyder made when building the DCU,

171
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.560
he could only see the superheroes and the world.

172
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.230
They inhabit through a grimy pessimistic lens,

173
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.000
but just like the dark age of comics,

174
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.350
Snyder seemed preoccupied with the dark surface rather than the intellectual

175
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.551
core furthering this,

176
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:36.630
his overriding warship of those fabled deconstructive as comics caused a big

177
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.710
problems when he drew from other less gritty source material to highlight this,

178
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:41.970
let's look at man of steel.

179
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.780
The origin story for the granddaddy of all superheroes Snyder actually draws

180
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:47.190
from a lot of influences here,

181
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.660
predominantly the classic optimistic Superman comics birthright by Mark Wade and

182
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.640
all-star Superman by grant Morrison.

183
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.130
The movie wears these influences on its sleeve.

184
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.790
Things like Clark flying alongside a herd of zebra and the S crest on his

185
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.020
costume standing for hope.

186
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.540
<v 2>So this symbol means the symbol of the house of elements out.</v>

187
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.510
<v 1>Are pulled straight from birthright, even lifts the speech,</v>

188
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.790
almost word for word from all-star Superman.

189
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.240
<v 2>You will give the people of earth an ideal to strive towards</v>

190
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.870
they'll race behind you. They will stumble or fall,

191
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.340
but in time

192
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.510
they will join you in the sun down.

193
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.350
<v 1>The standards nods to these inspirations are essentially lip service.</v>

194
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.070
We get acknowledgements by the way of shared design imagery and dialogue.

195
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.480
<v 2>On my world. It means hope.</v>

196
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.120
<v 1>The Snyder seemingly can't reconcile their hopeful,</v>

197
00:10:41.121 --> 00:10:45.380
uplifting themes with his own cynicism. We know this because whenever possible,

198
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.650
man of steel takes the dark and gritty option. We covered this in our,

199
00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:49.970
what went wrong for man of steel,

200
00:10:49.971 --> 00:10:53.990
but between the rampant collateral damage and Superman actively murdering Zada,

201
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.040
the climax man of steel doesn't look kindly upon the big blue boy scout.

202
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.430
The creative team has explained that the intention was to have him eventually

203
00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:04.550
grow into the morally grounded Superman we know and love,

204
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.050
but here's the problem.

205
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.790
Snyder introduces the character already subverted his anx and general hand

206
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.110
wringing placing him closer to a reluctant hero instead of the Paragon of truth,

207
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.070
justice and hope. But Superman is arguably the archetypal superhero.

208
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.670
You can't introduce a definitive archetype and deconstruct that archetype

209
00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:25.550
simultaneously. Otherwise you're not introducing Superman.

210
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.590
You're introducing big flying dude.

211
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.970
The prodo Superman that we see in man of steel is ultimately so far from the

212
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:36.230
Superman that we recognize that he's a different character entirely Snyder gave

213
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:39.470
us even more insight into this choice in an interview in which the journalist

214
00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:43.310
stated that the so-called no wind scenario is the only way to test a heroes

215
00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:46.160
rules and ethics. Snyder agreed adding that.

216
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:49.610
It's the only way to move forward with the hero because otherwise the hero

217
00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:52.430
drowns in the mire of his own morality. According to this,

218
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:56.430
you can view the climax of man of steel as the ultimate moral, an ethical test,

219
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.690
except Superman fails in every conceivable way.

220
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.720
Literally the first metahuman Superman has to deal with,

221
00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:07.350
causes him to lose all phones, focus, allowing metropolis to be leveled,

222
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.160
countless people to die. And Superman becomes a murderer. Snyder.

223
00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:14.640
Superman doesn't even register that. He could do anything else other than snap,

224
00:12:14.641 --> 00:12:15.474
some necks.

225
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:20.130
This is a textbook example of dark and gritty disguised as supposed clever

226
00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:20.964
subversion.

227
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.630
It's worth stating that at this point Snyder's plan to essentially build up to a

228
00:12:24.631 --> 00:12:28.620
true Superman was still viable. We'd only seen one movie after all,

229
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.850
which brings us to Batman,

230
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.610
the Superman and where the cracks really begin to show.

231
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.880
See Batman V Superman was supposed to be another Superman film,

232
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.860
a direct sequel to man of steel,

233
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.890
but then Snyder decided to add Batman in there and make Millers.

234
00:12:40.891 --> 00:12:43.770
The dark Knight returns. The central influence Batman V.

235
00:12:43.771 --> 00:12:47.760
Superman is notorious for being a dumpster fire of a movie. And again,

236
00:12:47.761 --> 00:12:50.700
we've covered it in its own, what went wrong. But for this video,

237
00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:53.220
let's look at Snyder's two main inspirations.

238
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.520
The dark Knight returns as mentioned, and the death of Superman,

239
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.540
which Snyder chooses to take from them and what he chooses to admit. Once again,

240
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:04.200
demonstrate his fascination with surface level gritty subversion.

241
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.600
The first time we see them together on the big screen,

242
00:13:06.601 --> 00:13:10.290
we get a frankly psychotic Batman, killing goons,

243
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.080
branding people and straight up premeditating,

244
00:13:13.081 --> 00:13:16.260
the cold blooded murder of Superman and Superman. Well,

245
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.640
he's just sort of there perhaps presumably internally struggling and taking

246
00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:23.700
these surface level angst and violence from the dark Knight returns,

247
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.720
but ignoring the deeper themes. Snyder creates a contradiction and character.

248
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.320
Whereas the dark Knight returns asks us to consider the archetypical Batman's

249
00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:35.790
relationship to violence or Robin Snyder simply wants us to consider how cool it

250
00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:38.790
is that Batman brands, people or put another way.

251
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.870
The dark Knight returns is in conversation with and criticizes the established

252
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:47.400
Batman mythos Batman V Superman on the other hand is talking to itself and it's

253
00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:49.410
mostly saying grit is good.

254
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.650
The same issues apply to Snyder's use of the death of Superman.

255
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.520
Ironically could have helped Snyder build up his wholesome version of the man of

256
00:13:56.521 --> 00:13:59.880
steel released in the midst of the dark age of comics. The death of Superman.

257
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.350
See Superman died at the hands of doomsday, four separate heroes, super boy,

258
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.990
steal Eradicator and cyborg Superman,

259
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.040
try to fill the hole that his death has left a metropolis to varying degrees of

260
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:11.790
success.

261
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.480
But when a bigger threat in the form of Mongol aided by none other than cyborg,

262
00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:17.160
Superman appears to wreak havoc.

263
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.200
Superman returns from the dead proving to be the only one who can stop them

264
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.290
and be worthy of the title of Superman. The medically,

265
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:29.040
the whole story revolves around the notion that a dark and gritty Superman isn't

266
00:14:29.041 --> 00:14:33.000
Superman at all the methods of the four replacement Superman actually reflect

267
00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:36.490
the edgy grim heroes of the nineties. However, the only thing Snyder,

268
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.610
this is Superman plus death rather than seeing how Superman's death could

269
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.530
fulfill Phil. His arc of redeeming him,

270
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.650
Snyder ignores everything else to once again,

271
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.950
hyper-focus on the surface fact that Superman done died by time justice league

272
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:54.050
rolled around the damage had already been done.

273
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.550
We pick up where Snyder left off Superman's dead Batman's guilt-ridden and

274
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:02.150
struggling with his violent tendencies and wonder woman's oddly detached from

275
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.600
everything. While we may never know the entirety of Snyder's plans.

276
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:06.434
What we do know,

277
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.250
paint a somewhat conflicted picture on the one hand Snyder's vision would have

278
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:14.800
revealed Martian Manhunter and green lantern completing the iconic justice legal

279
00:15:14.801 --> 00:15:16.670
lineup facing off against dark side,

280
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.370
which makes it hard enough to pine for what could have been.

281
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.570
But on the other hand,

282
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.240
even more time would have been spent in the nightmare future,

283
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.960
but they decimated justice league fighting back against the brainwash fascist

284
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:27.620
Superman.

285
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.250
That part would have been inspired by Tom Taylor and Brian Buccellato injustice

286
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:31.970
comics,

287
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:36.320
a grim gritty and cynical deconstructive tale that asks what if Superman broke

288
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.280
bat based on Snyder's previous adaptations, it's not hard to extrapolate.

289
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.240
We suspect the same kind of surface level cynical interpretation would have come

290
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:45.350
into effect here too.

291
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.590
But ultimately we can't know for sure because Snyder didn't get to complete his

292
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:49.160
vision.

293
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.100
And we'll never really know if his controversial choices would have paid off

294
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:52.461
still.

295
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:56.420
The fact remains that we did get most of the story and most of us hated it so

296
00:15:56.421 --> 00:16:00.260
much so that it killed the idea of an interconnected cinematic universe dead.

297
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.940
It's not all doom and gloom though.

298
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.060
DC and Warner brothers have stepped back from their sprawling plans of

299
00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:05.810
connectivity,

300
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.930
handing the reins over to a creative team that are willing to embrace the

301
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:12.890
bright, playful and hopeful nature of the genre. Wonder woman Aquaman,

302
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:17.000
and Shizam have generated warmer reception from fans and critics alike and

303
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:19.970
indicate a less depressing future for DC films.

304
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.140
But what do you think wise crack did Snyder missed the point or are we being too

305
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:26.420
hard on the guy? Let us know what you're thinking. The comments,
