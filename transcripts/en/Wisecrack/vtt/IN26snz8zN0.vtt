<v 0>This video is brought to you by curiosity stream.</v>

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:08.750
What's up guys,

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.160
Helen here to talk about something we collectively hate and yet continue to

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.670
glutinous Lee indulge in election season. You know,

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.390
that special time when everyone bombard you with digital ads, planning, emails,

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.410
annoying surveys, and inexplicably, real paper mail,

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.010
all to convince you to vote for their choice of fancy suited white tooth

8
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:32.240
candidate. Now elections are a necessity for any functioning democracy,

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.440
but nowhere in the constitution does it mandate that the media spend two full

10
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:40.640
calendar years pumping America's homes full of speculation about likeability,

11
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.770
electability, presidential Ines, and so very occasionally policy issues.

12
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.520
In fact,

13
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.810
it kind of makes us freaks on the world stage Canadians consider 11 weeks to be

14
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:53.480
a long election cycle while in France campaigning.

15
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:56.120
Can't last more than two weeks before the first round of voting,

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.100
which is to say the contemporary.

17
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.570
<v 1>American presidential election Bonanza is not the norm for the world.</v>

18
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.490
<v 0>So how did we get here?</v>

19
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.720

20
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.830

28

29
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.350

Thanks to curiosity stream for sponsoring this episode.

39
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.350
And now back to the show.

40
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.580
And now we got to talk about a major political heavyweight, you know,

41
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.610
president William Henry Harrison now. Okay. Okay.

42
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.090
He's not exactly the sexiest name in politics. If you know him at all,

43
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.330
it's because he kicked the bucket almost immediately after becoming president.

44
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.563
<v 1>In 30.</v>

45
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.600
<v 0>Days.</v>

46
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.870
But his short lived tenure in the white house was made possible by a pretty

47
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:37.040
radical decision. He campaigned that's it. That's the radical decision.

48
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.450
William Henry Harrison campaigned for the presidency. It sounds totally bananas.

49
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.480
But for the first 100 years of American history,

50
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.500
it was pretty taboo for a presidential candidate to publicly try to become

51
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.440
president. No, really, as Richard J.

52
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.260
Ellis and Mark Detrick explained for close to a hundred years,

53
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.980
the prevailing norm was that the presidency was not an office.

54
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:02.560
One should actively this precedent dated back to 1789.

55
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.150
When George Washington very reluctantly accepted the gig after a unanimous vote

56
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:11.680
by the young country's electors after years of war and presumably bad food,

57
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.290
all this tire general wanted was to chill at home.

58
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.170
Instead he humbly accepted the call of duty.

59
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.470
The men who angled to succeed him somewhat followed his example,

60
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.610
modestly accepting their party's nomination before disappearing from public view

61
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.870
until the results were in.

62
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.560
Of course the stuffy propriety was undoubtedly a performance.

63
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.510
If you were Thomas Jefferson, for instance,

64
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.260
you wouldn't campaign so much as casually sort of bribe someone to start a

65
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:39.130
newspaper purely for the purposes of roasting your opponents while publicly

66
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:40.900
campaigning for president. Wasn't cool.

67
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.680
It never stopped tons of candidates like Andrew Jackson or Abraham Lincoln from

68
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.740
still the lead controlling their campaigns behind the scenes,

69
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.760
but asking people to vote for you directly, that was just kind of tacky.

70
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.390
You weren't supposed to be too greedy for power. Explain scholar,

71
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:59.350
Michael Kasmin. Even the presidential embodiment of the Tasmanian devil.

72
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.370
Andrew Jackson was convinced by his advisors to let up on his letter writing

73
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:06.820
campaign and agreeably keep silent. When running for reelection,

74
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.750
don't get me wrong. There were still campaigns throughout the century.

75
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.320
Surrogates and supporters of candidates would do the dirty work of actually

76
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:15.250
rousing voters.

77
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.870
But as scholar Jeffrey Toolis puts it candidates exemplified a public teaching

78
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.100
that political campaigns were beneath the dignity of men suited for governance.

79
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.930
As land ownership requirements were abolished newly eligible voters that is

80
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.050
landless white dudes wanted to know who the hell they were voting for.

81
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.100
This created a tension where candidates wanted to be appropriately dignified

82
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.720
while also telling average Joes what they thought enter my man,

83
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:42.670
Harrison, who would knighted what scholar,

84
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:47.170
Kathleen Hall Jamison calls the presidency's first full-blown campaign in

85
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:51.730
1840 Harrison was a military man, but his record was a bit spotty.

86
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.090
When he first ran for president as a wig in 1836,

87
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.660
he orchestrated a tour through four States where he was met with horse-drawn

88
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:01.240
carriage, parades, bonfires, and singing.

89
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.440
It gave us sensibly apolitical speeches about the importance of the declaration

90
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:09.850
of independence and in offensive patriotic stuff, still dude lost,

91
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.810
but things were going to get real wild in 1840. That's when Harrison,

92
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:16.090
once again tried for the presidency this time,

93
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.270
at least pretending to be intent on maintaining the basic decorum.

94
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.720
Washington had shown by staying the hell home. After all,

95
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.110
he had explained where he stood on everything in 1836, right?

96
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.250
Tell that to the democratic newspapers who instantly responded by calling him

97
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.150
general mom,

98
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.560
a caged simpleton and an old granny for refusing to voice his stance on the

99
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:36.394
issues.

100
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.910
Other attacks decried him as a sort of Backwoods Yahoo who would be content to

101
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:42.730
live in a log cabin, drinking cider and collecting his pension.

102
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.450
What they didn't know was that Harrison's wig party would seize on this imagery,

103
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.770
making the log cabin hard cider and objectively dope coonskin hat.

104
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:52.120
The symbol of his campaign,

105
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.080
ironically Harrison was actually born into a wealthy family and lived in a

106
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:59.780
mansion anyway, intent on defending himself in his physical strength.

107
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.090
Harrison embarked on a tour around the country,

108
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.080
holding ruckus cider drenched rallies to prove how tough he was still.

109
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.530
He at least pretended to have some reservations in one speech,

110
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.000
Harrison confessed that this campaigning violated his sense of propriety and

111
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.060
that he feared he was establishing a dangerous precedent.

112
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.580
He told crowds that he wasn't there to campaign,

113
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.040
but this didn't stop him from decrying. His opponents,

114
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.030
basically the first real campaign was kind of just the result of one man's

115
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.580
refusal to, uh, look like he was sitting at home,

116
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:31.780
twiddling his thumbs in the process. Harrison,

117
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.160
who was maligned for being the then oldest candidate at 68 years of age,

118
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.970
rebranded himself as a 19th century, all American bro.

119
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.350
This is what Jamison calls,

120
00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:45.100
the first example of image advertising in presidential campaigning, right?

121
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.550
And after some exhausting, mid 19th century travel Harrison,

122
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.730
one intent on looking strong at the inauguration ceremony.

123
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.260
He did not wear a hat or a coat despite the miserable weather because wearing a

124
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:58.810
coat is for sissies, I guess. Anyway,

125
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.200
he talked for two hours and got seriously sick though.

126
00:07:02.201 --> 00:07:06.640
Most probably from drinking contaminated Washington DC water. Anyway,

127
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:09.850
he died just four weeks after which like bummer,

128
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.400
but Harrison's log cabin revolution.

129
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.930
Didn't change everything so fast for the next three elections publicly taking to

130
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:19.120
the stump that is traveling the nation,

131
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:21.220
giving the same speech over and over again.

132
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.350
It was actually considered a bad move.

133
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.670
The only candidate to repeat Harrison's ballsy antics was with general Winfield,

134
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:31.540
Scott fuel orange democratic disdain for encouraging man worship.

135
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.710
When he lost everyone. Extolled his victorious opponent, Franklin Pierce,

136
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.980
and his silence and blame Scott for being a blabber mouth.

137
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.810
This continued from 1860 to 1872 during which Democrats kept

138
00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:48.100
stumping and kept losing. However, image advertising was still evolving.

139
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.340
You couldn't go anywhere without seeing a photograph of Abe Lincoln's face,

140
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.320
but the guy was nowhere to be found.

141
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.010
He didn't write letters or make speeches or participate in debates.

142
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.670
Those famous Lincoln Douglas debates were actually over a Senate seat,

143
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.900
which was a little more kosher. Anyway, the curse of the stump loomed large,

144
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.290
but at the same time, people wanted to hear their guy talk.

145
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.420
So late 19th century,

146
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.770
we saw kind of uneasy transition into that front porch speech or several

147
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:16.300
candidates like games, Garfield,

148
00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:19.750
or Benjamin Harrison invited supporters over to watch them speak from their

149
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:22.090
house, which wasn't technically campaigning.

150
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.430
Cause you were just being a polite host. Okay?

151
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.510
Like how it isn't technically assaulted by swinging this bat wildly around.

152
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:32.170
And you just happened to me in front of me, which is to say it totally is.

153
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.430
And so slowly it becomes increasingly less taboo for the presidential candidate

154
00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:37.570
to speak for themselves.

155
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.100
But this modest style of campaigning would get seriously undermined with one

156
00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:46.270
William Jennings, Bryan, former democratic congressmen and renowned orator.

157
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.520
Brian never won the presidency,

158
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.910
but he'd go down in history for revolutionizing the modern campaign,

159
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.190
a pioneer of the whistle-stop tour,

160
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.270
which used the railway system to traverse a nation.

161
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.400
Brian embarked on four big trips,

162
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.730
giving some speeches at nearly every railway stop.

163
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.750
His regimen of 600 passionate speeches in three months reached by some

164
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:11.190
estimates, 5 million Americans. Meanwhile, his opponent, William McKinley,

165
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.120
stuck to the chiller front porch campaign while letting a sprawling network of

166
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.420
surrogates do most of the campaigning for him at the same time.

167
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.200
Brian encountered pushback from Republicans who criticized him for begging for

168
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:24.750
the presidency as a tramp might beg for a tie,

169
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.280
but Brian knew he was playing to his strengths as an incredibly effective order

170
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.140
known for rousing crowds to mania with lines like you shall not crucify mankind

171
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.390
on a cross of gold though. Brian lost.

172
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.940
He marked an important moment in campaign history.

173
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.860
When according to Ellison Dedrick,

174
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.910
the nominee was expected to be the primary spokesman and central figure of the

175
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:47.960
campaign. This is the world we exist in today, of course,

176
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.520
but what this change came, another development, the rise of the personality,

177
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.440
or more specifically the package personality for candidates and his speeches

178
00:09:57.441 --> 00:10:01.250
would start moving from stump tours to your home via radio and television.

179
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.940
People began to care more and more about what their favorite candidate was like.

180
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.700
Are they a huge Weeb? Can I have a beer with them?

181
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.360
Do I get the vague sense that they Moonlight as a serial killer Franklin

182
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:11.930
Roosevelt,

183
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.920
like his uncle Teddy seemed to recognize this instinctively and his ability to

184
00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:16.820
project warmth,

185
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.260
likeability and Supreme competence in newsreels and over the radio encouraged a

186
00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:24.950
nation while an incumbent president campaigning for reelection was still

187
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:27.650
generally frowned upon FDR for the most part,

188
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.000
spun himself more diplomatically as a president of the whole people and got away

189
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:33.110
with it. Of course,

190
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.430
Roosevelt was consciously doing some major image advertising all our boy

191
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.820
Harrison, the guy who was savvy about the way he packaged his own brand,

192
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.110
always campaigning with his same cigarette holder, jaunty, top hat, Ponce, neck,

193
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.730
and smile. He effortlessly exuded a compelling personality, equal parts,

194
00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:51.680
jokester and calming voice of reason.

195
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.850
Stricken with polio Roosevelt was determined to portray physical strength in the

196
00:10:55.851 --> 00:11:00.110
media and developed all kinds of sneaky ways to hide his paralysis in his

197
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:01.010
political career.

198
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.550
He'd pull stunts to emphasize his strength like flying to the national

199
00:11:04.551 --> 00:11:05.061
convention.

200
00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:09.230
To accept his candidacy back when air travel was dangerous and embarking on

201
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:10.160
railroad tours,

202
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.610
where he was able to appear to be standing on his own while secretly being

203
00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:15.050
supported by a steel bar.

204
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.460
Overall Roosevelt used campaigning to prove he was presidential both in its

205
00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:23.570
assumed norms of health and this whole personality driven. I'm a man stick.

206
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.840
Of course we can see similar themes rippling into today.

207
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.040
When our current president works overtime to stress his vigor and health after

208
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:34.190
contracting a deadly virus, I feel much better now.

209
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.580
So in some ways the quest to prove yourself tough, healthy,

210
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:39.980
and manly has been something of a constant,

211
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.450
but a lot else has changed specifically the rhetoric of how

212
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.920
personality is conveyed.

213
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.790
If you want to understand how our personality driven elections have become a

214
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.910
nonstop it's of TV ads and dumb optics. We to talk about Dwight D Eisenhower,

215
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.890
the first TV candidate. No,

216
00:11:56.891 --> 00:12:01.270
it's not that Eisenhower was just the first candidate to widely campaign on TV

217
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.050
it's that he handed over a big chunk of his strategy to admin.

218
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.340
It was 1951. And though he was the most popular man in America.

219
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.230
Eisenhower had no government experience outside the military and so sought to

220
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:18.190
convey legitimacy instead of counting on the lengthy speeches of your,

221
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.720
he hired ad men to produce several dozen short TV spots of him answering

222
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:27.370
advertiser pen questions for cited by average Americans with advertiser pinned

223
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:31.840
answers to say these were light on policy or any assumptions for that matter.

224
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.500
It is an understatement Eisenhower initially worried that these ads were

225
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.700
undignified, but was convinced to give it a shot at the admin's behest.

226
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.440
He removed his glasses, changed his clothes and talked faster in this way.

227
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.251
According to scholar,

228
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:49.930
John E Khalid's Eisenhower's admin had accomplished the first successful attempt

229
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.100
to sell a presidential candidate by employing the same techniques that sold soap

230
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.300
and toothpaste. Now, if you preferred a less made for TV candidate,

231
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.630
you might've fancied the hyper intellectual Adelai Stevenson.

232
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.380
He was called an egg head for being a smarty pants who talked fancy.

233
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.460
His beautiful rhetoric was of course irrelevant because he looked hella

234
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:10.600
uncomfortable on screen,

235
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.470
struggling with the teleprompter and flashing an awkward smile Stevenson,

236
00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:16.120
losed appearing in political ads,

237
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.910
considering them too short to fully express his ideas.

238
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.330
And let's just say his performances didn't have that special possess.

239
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.850
<v 2>Which the Eisenhower administration has been giving away.</v>

240
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.350
<v 0>He's been described as a 19th century style presidential candidate who unlike</v>

241
00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:35.220
his opponent refuse to be packaged or phony while Republicans spent somewhere

242
00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:37.350
around $1 million on TV ads,

243
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:42.330
Democrats spent just 77,000 Stevenson ran against Eisenhower and

244
00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:46.650
lost twice. Demonstrating that packaging. Your personality was now paramount.

245
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.610
The intimacy of television demanded that the candidate be personable showing

246
00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:53.160
empathy and likability above all.

247
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.660
It's a little by the importance of TV friendly catch lines over any meaningful

248
00:13:57.661 --> 00:14:01.560
engagement with the issues. And we're still feeling the effects today.

249
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.610
So to win the presidency, no you had to be palatable on television.

250
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.470
You see what's coming after all, what's more palatable than a celebrity.

251
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.240
Enter JFK on incredibly charismatic politician who spent five years

252
00:14:15.241 --> 00:14:18.930
building a grassroots operation and giving speeches to gain popularity.

253
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.270
If Eisenhower was the first TV candidate,

254
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.240
Kennedy was the first candidate actually made for TV,

255
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.870
able to give short decisive answers with profound eloquence.

256
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.250
And he knew it packaging. His persona is that of the youthful vital,

257
00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:33.810
compassionate, strong leader.

258
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.440
Kennedy had this thing in the bag as his father put it,

259
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.990
we're going to sell Jack like snowflakes.

260
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.330
It was Kennedy who would invite his opponent,

261
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.240
Richard Nixon to the first ever presidential debate,

262
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.320
taking place on millions of TV screens. It wasn't even a fair fight.

263
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.270
The youthful and aesthetically blessed spent weeks tanning and wore a bit of

264
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:56.420
stage makeup, which Nixon refused appearing pale,

265
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.330
nervous and sweaty in a suit that blended into the background.

266
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.380
There's more of radio listeners believed Nixon won and TV viewers believed

267
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:07.280
Kennedy had, but not really enough data to back it up. Still.

268
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.120
What we do know is that the debate was so decisive and boosting Kennedy's

269
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:15.770
campaign eventually to victory that no sitting president agreed to participate

270
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:17.960
in debates for another 16 years.

271
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.640
The presidency had now in many ways firmly become a bonafide popularity

272
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:25.760
contest. Once a candidate becomes a packaged personality,

273
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.420
it becomes very easy to become obsessed with anything that might tarnish that

274
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:32.690
packaging candidates began to see if they were likable enough with

275
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:34.280
hyper-specific polling data,

276
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.160
all rise of this data and the weakening of party power.

277
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.480
It's something specific to our politics as outlined by Sidney Blumenthal in his

278
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:45.410
1980 book, the permanent campaign starting with Lyndon Johnson,

279
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.870
Blumenthal explained, we saw the act of governance,

280
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:51.920
become a perpetual effort to get reelected with the combined use of political

281
00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:56.180
strategy and image making as Blumenthal rights, permanent campaigning,

282
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.470
remakes government into an instrument designed to sustain an elected officials,

283
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:02.300
popularity. Essentially.

284
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.410
This meant the line between campaigning and governing sorted the disappear as

285
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:08.630
presidents made choices and conveyed messages.

286
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.110
Increasingly based on the reaction, it would incur from the American people.

287
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.150
According to scholar, Hugo heckler,

288
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.080
the strategy of permanent campaigning crystallized under Richard Nixon,

289
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.620
who employed unprecedented white house use of public opinion,

290
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:25.310
polling political consultants and comprehensive media strategies.

291
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.970
And like in pursuit of a second term, to those who hated him,

292
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.680
Hecla writes the man's whole political existence seemed a shabby and conniving

293
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:34.940
prominent campaign.

294
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.440
This arguably can be seen in his inconsistency on civil rights when courting

295
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:43.460
Northern black votes in 1960, he seem to generally committed to the cause.

296
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.580
<v 3>Equal rights for all our citizens.</v>

297
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.280
Why must we vigorously defend them first? Because it is right. And just.

298
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.460
<v 0>According Southern white votes in 1972,</v>

299
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.130
he was against laws that would further integrate schools.

300
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:02.470
<v 3>I do not believe that busing to achieve racial balance is in the interest</v>

301
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.850
of better education.

302
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.100
<v 0>And by admission of his own campaign,</v>

303
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.400
invoked racist anxieties with dog whistle rhetoric.

304
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.750
<v 4>[Inaudible] that hurts you. It backfires.</v>

305
00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:17.590
So you say stuff like forced busing States' rights and all that stuff.

306
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.030
<v 0>Permanent campaign and paramount importance of political celebrity continued</v>

307
00:17:22.031 --> 00:17:24.400
with literal Hollywood slash political celebrity.

308
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.180
Ronald Reagan's rise to power after easily beating incumbent.

309
00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:30.610
Jimmy Carter Reagan did something unexpected.

310
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.150
He brought all of his campaigns best pollsters, media, masters,

311
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.420
and tacticians with him to the white house there,

312
00:17:37.421 --> 00:17:40.960
they worked throughout his presidency using the same campaign techniques to

313
00:17:40.961 --> 00:17:45.070
address and win the approval of the American people. As a 1981,

314
00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:49.000
New York times article put it for the Reagan white house every night is election

315
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.290
night on television. Their obsessive strategizing was why.

316
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.370
According to the times,

317
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.210
Reagan had such stunning success in shaping public opinion. Of course,

318
00:17:57.211 --> 00:17:59.160
with constant campaigning comes constant.

319
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:03.030
Image-making Reagan used his first term to cultivate his own mythology.

320
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.780
That meant endless strategic photo ops was showing him riding horses,

321
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.380
chopping wood, pumping iron like many a candidate before him.

322
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.490
The oldest president,

323
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:15.990
no doubt felt pressure to portray himself as a dude who does dude like things.

324
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.710
Well,

325
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.610
Reagan had previously run on a reasonably robust platform of reducing inflation

326
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.390
and taxes.

327
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:26.250
His 1984 campaign was according to a Republican strategist virtually issue list.

328
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.750
His ads pedal largely an image-based patriotism with Naria policy discussion to

329
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:33.930
be found. This is when that song I'm proud to be an American,

330
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.040
became something of an Anthem for 50% of the country and a terrible ear worm for

331
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:41.310
future generations. The phenomenon of the permanent campaign.

332
00:18:41.311 --> 00:18:45.780
It can be traced in each subsequent presidency at the same time Hecla notes,

333
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.530
the politics of permanent campaigning and the media is consequent framing of

334
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:51.150
every day as a political battle,

335
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:55.710
that is to be won or lost prioritizes dramatic conflict over meaningful debate

336
00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:58.320
about the issues over the next 30 years,

337
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.390
the permanent campaign became an ongoing quest to seem presidential AKA likable

338
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:06.990
and popular as candidates and presidents alike turned increasingly to

339
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:07.650
entertainment.

340
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:12.120
Venues like talk shows to establish their homespun like ability once elected.

341
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.770
They continued to reestablish that likeability over and over and over again.

342
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.520
How does it feel having a three inch vertical it's a three inch horizontal

343
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:25.470
George Bush took 416 trips frequently to swing States in his first three

344
00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:26.190
years.

345
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.640
While bill Clinton even created a voter poll to decide where he should go on

346
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:30.474
vacation.

347
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.180
So the line between governing and campaigning continued to erode all the

348
00:19:35.181 --> 00:19:39.140
while more and more money would continue to pour into the political game of

349
00:19:39.141 --> 00:19:43.340
marketing charisma, particularly after the citizens United decision,

350
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.320
which allowed for limitless money to flood into elections at the same time as

351
00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:52.040
the media increasingly focused on the most contentious aspects of politicking

352
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.000
rather than actual policy issues, negative ads about the other candidates,

353
00:19:56.001 --> 00:20:00.860
personal suckiness dominated by 2012 only 14.3% of

354
00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:04.100
ads were positive according to a university of Mississippi study,

355
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.670
which brings us to today when presidents must seem presidential,

356
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.090
but no one can seem to agree with that means while a shoeing,

357
00:20:11.091 --> 00:20:14.540
many norms of running a campaign, Donald Trump is paradoxically.

358
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.230
The natural extension of years of increased obsession with presidential

359
00:20:18.231 --> 00:20:19.064
personality.

360
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:23.150
The former apprentice star has spent years preoccupied with his own celebrity,

361
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:28.100
crafting an image as a shrewd businessmen unencumbered by any rules at the same

362
00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:28.640
time,

363
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.050
democratic attacks of him center around how unpresidential his personality is.

364
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.063
And of course,

365
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.120
Trump is the embodiment of the permanent candidate filing his paperwork for

366
00:20:38.121 --> 00:20:38.810
reelection.

367
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.680
The day he took office and continuing rallies throughout his tenure and a

368
00:20:42.681 --> 00:20:44.300
pandemic. By this point,

369
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.550
we'd all become so used to the permanent campaign that took his extreme approach

370
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:52.630
to make anybody really notice something strange was going on after one more

371
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:56.650
campaign season that seems to stretch on for eternity and a series of debates

372
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:59.830
that could only be described generously as hell on earth.

373
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.380
We're left. Wondering if keeping up to date on campaign news is making us less,

374
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.880
rather than more informed,

375
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.020
maybe our fixation on the personality and personal proclivities of any

376
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:14.860
individual candidate. Hasn't just become an ain, but dangerous.

377
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.050
When we were obsessed with someone's likeability,

378
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.920
we can find ourselves lulled into supporting the most grotesque policies.

379
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.670
Political campaigning began in the first place because people wanted to know

380
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:26.920
where their candidates stood on the issues.

381
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.360
It's devolved to the point where candidate positions often feel more inscrutable

382
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:36.280
after watching them debate or in an ad or on a talk show as much reporting

383
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:39.520
as there is about the candidates and their presidential Ines.

384
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.390
It can feel like there's very little actually being taught or learned,

385
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.780
but who knows, maybe we're all becoming savvy to this.

386
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.320
Maybe there will be some magical backlash when people start speculating about

387
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:52.570
the 20, 24 election three weeks from now,

388
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.260
or maybe we can stop the weird personality worship of politicians.

389
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.120
One can only dream,

390
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.960
but what do you guys think is the American campaign cycle?

391
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:06.610
Just proof of how good we are a democracy or is it a literal scourge in our

392
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:09.700
nation and also raising my blood pressure for no reason.

393
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.190
