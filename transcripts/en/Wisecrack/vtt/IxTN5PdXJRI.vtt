00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.220
<v 1>Hey wise, crack Greg here today.</v>

2
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:11.510
We're looking at the show about everyone's favorite, tiny habit, humanitarian.

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.580
The weird, hilarious, and often heartwarming Nickelodeon classic. Hey Arnold.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.250
Hey, Arnold stands out among kids shows for the web,

5
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:24.110
portrays the life of a city kid, every dirty smelly, terrifying.

6
00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:27.110
Second up on the streets, all know him, his friends,

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.600
cross paths with grumpy unhoused people.

8
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.210
<v 0>Hey, what are you doing in my house?</v>

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.800
<v 1>Face down giant rats and even getting mugged</v>

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.530
at home. The kids are exposed to neglect and alcoholism.

11
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.100
I need to smell and witnessed scenes of domestic violence.

12
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.390
<v 0>I heard you were at the race track and it wasn't that the race director,</v>

13
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.600
wasn't looking for a job in the same neighborhood as the racetrack.

14
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.643
<v 1>What's more,</v>

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.210
the shell tends to treat these things as a bad drop that's of life to be taken

16
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.150
and slide. We're not assessed me street anymore, kids.

17
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.320
So why does this kid's show make city life look so dang bleak and what can they

18
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.200
teach us about the way our environment shapes our lives?

19
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.580
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on Hey Arnold, and, uh,

20
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.730
spoilers ahead, I guess. I mean, who hasn't seen this before we get into,

21
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.930
Hey Arnold, I wanted to take a moment to talk about the holidays.

22
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.220
This is the time of year.

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.930
When we come together with our friends and family to celebrate the past year and

24
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:30.200
show our love and appreciation through the giving of gifts.

25
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.660
You know that man,

26
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.900
why should I have to waste my own money to buy a present for an uncle that once

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.430
asked on my high school girlfriend's phone number? Yeah. This year,

28
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.290
give yourself with some amazing wise crack Mertz. We've got shirts, sweaters,

29
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.670
hats, and mugs,

30
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.220
which are perfect for sipping on some rum spiked eggnog while suffering through

31
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.550
a holiday zone call. And if you order right now with cold dead inside,

32
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.200
you'll get 10% off.

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.670
So take care of yourself this year and worry about everyone else next year.

34
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.350
Or if you want to make Santa proud,

35
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.890
you can buy some decorative socks for your little brother. That's your thing.

36
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.730
This special offer only lasts through the end of this shot of a year.

37
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.410
So head the wise, crack that store and use the cold dead inside.

38
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.950
Now back to the show Arnold and his friends grow up in a world,

39
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:23.900
far removed from Kevin McCallister swanky room at the Plaza hotel with

40
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.300
the exception of Rhonda and sometimes Helga.

41
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.660
Most of the kids in Arnold's neighborhood come from families from struggling to

42
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:30.494
make ends, meet.

43
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.850
<v 0>55 Saints all by raise the bus fire. And now they're Nick.</v>

44
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.380
<v 1>Parts of the neighborhood are rundown are completely abandoned and these crappy</v>

45
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:41.570
conditions obviously affect the character.

46
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.853
<v 0>Oh goodness.</v>

47
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.590
<v 1>Well, Hey Arnold, isn't just a show about city grit as seen by a child.</v>

48
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.660
It is in part a show about how the geography around a person can shut down her

49
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:55.700
life. And for the kids of Hillwood,

50
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.220
that geography is the city itself to understand we can turn it to the

51
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.140
philosophical and artistic movement.

52
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.570
Knowing that situation ism situation is believed that modern life was as writer

53
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.260
grille, Marcus puts it boring and therefore wrong.

54
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.970
That's largely because it breeds loneliness and alienates people from each

55
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.470
other. And they blame much of that on city. Life situation is good.

56
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:25.030
The board theorized an entire discipline to study its effects called cycle

57
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:25.864
geography,

58
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.760
which he defines as the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the

59
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:35.170
geographical environment consciously organized or not on the emotions and

60
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:39.280
behavior of individuals. And in regards to the board's life in Paris,

61
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.700
the effects were in his humble opinion. Not great.

62
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.040
Now the board noted as many have that people who lived in desert areas tended to

63
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.340
develop monotheistic religions. In contrast,

64
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.020
he argued that life in certain parts of Paris was conducive rather to

65
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:00.850
atheism, to oblivion and to the disorientation of a will reflexes.

66
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.020
And other words,

67
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.030
life in his city made you an unhappy jerk and also maybe left you godless,

68
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.830
which we can loosely interpret as not believing in much of anything because the

69
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:16.060
situation is weren't so sacred about organized religion themselves.

70
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.410
Arnold's Hillwood is quite gritty and unfriendly to children,

71
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.380
pigeons eat from overflowing garbage cans,

72
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.640
subways break down and building seem large and intimidating.

73
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.350
Also an internal scourge of rats actually play critical roles in plot lines,

74
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.330
but not in the cool pizza rat way.

75
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.830
Arnold lives in a boarding house with a literal sign rating,

76
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.660
no kids sharing crowded spaces with adults who constantly get into

77
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:50.100
verbal and sometimes physical altercations Hillwood adults suffer from

78
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:53.580
alcoholism, gambling, addictions, and unemployment.

79
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.470
And one episode Arnold gets mugged and in another he's assaulted by a scary

80
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:03.390
neighborhood hooligans and has to be saved by weirdo superhero monkey, man,

81
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.830
the generalized anxiety, the kids feel about their city is exemplified.

82
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.620
When grandpa tells them about a terrifying hunting,

83
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.530
get drained upon seeking it out.

84
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.710
They learned that the train is simply transport steelworkers,

85
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.420
proving that the normal day to day city life can through the eyes of a child be

86
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:22.380
rendered truly.

87
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.243
<v 2>Scary.</v>

88
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.350
<v 1>Under the influence of a place like Hillwood.</v>

89
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.100
The board probably won't be surprised that many of the neighborhood children

90
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.130
already act and behave like jaded adults.

91
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.280
Arnold's best friend Gerald for instance, tends to be.

92
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.300
Self-centered looking out for his own interests at the expense of others while

93
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:46.500
he usually comes around. His first instinct is often to take the easiest,

94
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:50.970
most personally convenient route in the show's very first episode, for example,

95
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.800
I don't in Gerald skipped out on their roles and Helga's school play conflicted.

96
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.950
Arnold tells him think of Helga.

97
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.280
<v 3>And her play and all the kids back at school that we're letting down.</v>

98
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.090
What's your point in a similar.

99
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.840
<v 1>Helga takes after her father,</v>

100
00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:08.910
Bob and holding a ruthless aggressively materialist view of.

101
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.430
<v 3>Come off. Your high horse sister Christmas is about,</v>

102
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.640
it's about getting as much stuff as you can possibly get.

103
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.760
<v 1>These jaded children and the even more jaded adults.</v>

104
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.160
We see what situation is Adele,

105
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:26.050
how feed her team said about city life manifested as world governs our way

106
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:30.010
of being and it grinds us down. Even Arnold is a safe from this threat.

107
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.360
After being mugged,

108
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.650
he becomes obsessed with learning martial arts to defend themselves and has one

109
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:40.330
telling moment. When he imitates the craze, Travis Bickle from taxi driver,

110
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.590
you're talking to me, fittingly Bickell is the character in cinematic history.

111
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.300
Most famous for being a negatively affected by life and a decaying

112
00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:50.410
metropolis it.

113
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:54.760
Talking to me situation is believed that the true evil of the city is that it's

114
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:58.030
designed primarily to serve the interest of business.

115
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.060
And when an urban area is developed in pursuit of profit,

116
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.580
which the bore and co seem to think it's true,

117
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.410
it will necessarily be built to better serve more profitable areas,

118
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.120
classy neighborhoods with upscale, French cafes, equal clean streets,

119
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.420
flowery medians and uncracked sidewalks,

120
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.560
working class ones like Arnold's get dirty streets, loud,

121
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:25.000
overpasses and junkyard. This obviously hurts working people.

122
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.260
That's why New York city's public transit is designed to pump workers into a

123
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:31.540
central hub from the outer boroughs,

124
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.680
but not so much for you to visit your friend in another neighborhood in Queens.

125
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.050
People like Arnaud. Get the short end of the stick.

126
00:07:38.051 --> 00:07:40.600
When it comes to services like public transit.

127
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.110
This is even jokingly reference on the dad's subway episode.

128
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.940
When Gerald points to amaze of maps, tracking the complex secured track,

129
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.350
the kids must traverse them.

130
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.320
<v 3>Oh no, we should really be on the app.</v>

131
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.250
<v 1>Well, it's more,</v>

132
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.540
they're almost no publicly owned gathering places the kids can enjoy.

133
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.370
They spend most of their time on the street are re-appropriated wastelands of

134
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:06.610
urban living like landfills or vacant lots.

135
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.020
<v 3>Well, it was full of junk.</v>

136
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:11.940
We found and weekly ended up and turned it into jail field, but it's not all.

137
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.920
<v 1>The situation is like Arnold.</v>

138
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.830
We're willing to at least try it and look on the bright side.

139
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.510
The situation has wandered their urban areas for days, occasionally months,

140
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.850
even spending the night and catacombs.

141
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.790
<v 3>Just to mix things up, creepy egg.</v>

142
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.530
<v 1>Why they were in pursuit of what theorist Ivan touched a glove called</v>

143
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.110
forgotten desires are as grail puts it, images of play as centricity,

144
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.600
secret rebellion creativity,

145
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:45.700
and the geishas negotiation basically means refusal to play by the rules

146
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:48.610
of how a city naturally leads you to behave,

147
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.680
how the cycle geography and structure of it might compel you to basically they

148
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:57.810
were seeking out signs that were refusing to settle for the condition,

149
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.890
awful aspects of urban living. And that's the kids in, Hey Ronald,

150
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:02.724
in a nutshell,

151
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.990
they turned a garbage dump into a playground and dirty streets and the baseball

152
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:11.190
fields and a vacant grassy lot until a football field though,

153
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:13.380
their neighborhood is almost no trees.

154
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.120
They turn the one good one into a dope tree house and protect it from being

155
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:20.880
knocked down and replaced by our beeper store.

156
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.960
These are all examples of what the situation is looked for when they wandered

157
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.380
cityscapes. They weren't engaged the board's words,

158
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.480
inquest quest of another use of the urban landscape and quest of new passions.

159
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.340
That is to say in search of people,

160
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:39.540
enjoying their urban areas in ways the planners and never anticipated

161
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.230
still for the most part, this cityscape is a bit bleak,

162
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.070
but the show portrays this hostile environment with a weird,

163
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:52.050
wonderful visual style that says up yours to reality and plays freely with

164
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:53.220
the laws of physics.

165
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.420
More specifically when the characters and Hey Arnold are feeling certain

166
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:00.150
emotions, often confusion or fear,

167
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.410
the physical environment will shift and change around them in order to better

168
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:07.440
reflect those subjective feelings to the audience.

169
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.080
It's a weird reflection of cycle geography.

170
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.770
The ends of borrowing from another 20th century art movement,

171
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.250
which also dealt with dark realities of modern life.

172
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.470
German expressionism German expressionism was an early 20th century art

173
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:27.210
movement that prioritized communicating emotions. Overexpressing realism.

174
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.360
Interestingly enough, much of German expression.

175
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.340
His film was about making sense of the Starling and sometimes disturbing forces

176
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.970
of urban life. Often through steep, strange angles,

177
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.510
this jointed editing and major distortions of scale.

178
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.470
We see a similar effect in hanging on and the opening minutes of the episode

179
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.180
that subway buildings and streets that are normally straight appear curved and

180
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:52.830
distorted this force saddles,

181
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:57.420
the sense of disorder and chaos that will take over completely when the kid's

182
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:01.080
train car breaks down in a rat-infested subway tunnel.

183
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.620
<v 4>Open space.</v>

184
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.140
<v 1>Well, the shell frequently takes huge artistic liberties with proportion,</v>

185
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.910
shadow and color sacrificing the illusion of animated realism.

186
00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:18.530
You find in a show like King of the Hill in order to more directly convey the

187
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:21.950
chaotic in a world of its often disturbed characters.

188
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.910
What's more German expression is set designs in particular,

189
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.320
often wonky and twisted to the point of looking like something out of a pretty

190
00:11:30.321 --> 00:11:34.040
dark Dr. Sues. Now the same thing will happen in Hey Arnold.

191
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.550
When the character is going through a particularly area experience,

192
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.220
compare the dark winding tenement hallways,

193
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.640
a terrifying auto runs through in the classic episode,

194
00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:47.300
pigeon man to shots from the famous German expressing this film,

195
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.960
the cabinet of Dr. Caligari in a similar way,

196
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:52.720
the ghost story-driven for ride.

197
00:11:52.721 --> 00:11:57.100
Jack pulls lots of inspiration from the laboratory scenes and the German

198
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:00.940
expression, the scifi film metropolis, and it's big haired.

199
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:05.860
Wide-eyed inventor character, rod Wang, who inspired the mad scientist trope.

200
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:08.860
As we know it today, and this darkly render cityscape.

201
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.610
It's no wonder some kids turn out pretty Jaden, but of course,

202
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.800
there's one character who stands out.

203
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:20.490
<v 3>With hopeless monetary and with chivalry, when an overthinker Dick.</v>

204
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.810
<v 1>Had his friend cynicism and daily evidence of human shortcomings,</v>

205
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.980
Arnaud remains committed to seeing and bringing out the best in people.

206
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.110
<v 3>Responsible. I can't just ignore her. Of course you can share old, alright,</v>

207
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.600
but I'm warning. This is not going to be fun.

208
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:41.010
<v 1>The recurring conflict between Arnold's optimism and everyone else's pessimism</v>

209
00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.680
points to one of the questions at the heart of the show,

210
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.820
namely the matter of human nature. Now, when you live in a dirty,

211
00:12:47.821 --> 00:12:49.470
dangerous city, like Arnold's,

212
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.760
you can't blame folks for not taking much stock in the goodness of humanity,

213
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.860
still auto cleaning stubbornly to the belief that there is good in every person,

214
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.320
even if it's been buried under layers of hurts.

215
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.410
<v 3>I mean just because you're not reaching or doesn't mean you're a different</v>

216
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:07.860
person. You were Rhonda, when you had money and you could still be the same,

217
00:13:07.861 --> 00:13:09.320
Ron. And now that you don't any.

218
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.100
<v 1>It's a daily mission to find that good and help people bring it out in this way.</v>

219
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.130
Arnold's philosophy is very similar to that of Monza.

220
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.930
AKA mentions a Chinese Confucian philosopher who taught that all

221
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:24.810
humans have an inherent capacity for goodness.

222
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.790
They can grow that goodness provider.

223
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.590
They have access to the basic necessities for healthy life, food shelter,

224
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.980
worn clothing, et cetera. Why not philosophical twins?

225
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.610
There's still a certain thematic overlap with our cycle. Geographer.

226
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.430
It's convinced that urban sprawl was riding away.

227
00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:46.200
Our souls moms are famously compared the human ability to grow in virtue to a

228
00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:48.990
sprout like a little plant, just breaking out of it.

229
00:13:48.991 --> 00:13:53.640
See if you deny a sprout air, water and sunlight, it's not going to grow,

230
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.830
but if carefully tended the tiniest seed Lincoln become a mighty tree in the

231
00:13:58.831 --> 00:13:59.461
same way.

232
00:13:59.461 --> 00:14:03.990
When we tend to our innate ability to be kind or courageous or creative,

233
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.550
that virtue can mature into a powerful force. Just look at Jack Black.

234
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.860
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

235
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.450
<v 1>Many episodes, focus on our boy,</v>

236
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.040
helping someone deal with a problem or behavior so that they can live a fuller

237
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:23.700
life.

238
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.260
Consider the time he helps another boy at school kick the disturbingly literal

239
00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:29.640
addiction to chocolate.

240
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.050
<v 3>I need to get off chocolate. I mean dancy for malted milk balls and dig it.</v>

241
00:14:34.051 --> 00:14:37.350
And dumpsters I'm like a clown, a chocolate color.

242
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.180
<v 1>But of course Arnold's eternal project. The one person whose good side he sees,</v>

243
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.060
but can't bring out as hell. Good. G potassium

244
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.700
Helga is mean and abrasive to the neighborhood kids,

245
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.010
especially the Arnold who she secretly loves. She shoves away.

246
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:58.400
Anyone who tries to get closer sometimes literally,

247
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.030
but thanks to his belief in people's inherent capacity for goodness.

248
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.920
All no sense is a sign of Helga that normally only the audience gets to see

249
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.600
a part of her that recognizes and is moved by kindness and beauty.

250
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.620
<v 0>You're so bad, but deep down, I don't think you are.</v>

251
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.990
<v 1>Is that her best attributes are squashed by a neglectful repressive home life,</v>

252
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.070
which Monza would recognize as an obstacle to our growth and happiness,

253
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.050
especially in the later seasons.

254
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.400
There's good evidence that Helga is some kind of budding artistic genius.

255
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.990
Remember that time she memorized the entirety of Romeo and Juliet in one

256
00:15:34.991 --> 00:15:35.824
freaking night.

257
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.570
I got all night just for the chance to kiss Arnold with plausible deniability,

258
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.680
Not to mention, she's already offering pointed critiques,

259
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.600
a professional artwork at nine years.

260
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.500
<v 0>You like Edward Hopper. I do. Yeah. He's okay. He's a little simple though.</v>

261
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.070
And what's his deal with women anyway? That's pretty astute.

262
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.240
<v 1>Well Helga's parents do just about nothing to nurture this sprout of creativity,</v>

263
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.800
constantly ignoring and even neglecting her to lavish praise on her.

264
00:16:11.801 --> 00:16:12.850
Perfect older sister.

265
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.730
<v 0>Did you pick up my winter coat from the cleaners? Oh, Helga.</v>

266
00:16:17.731 --> 00:16:22.690
I forgot all the excitement, your sister being a home from Alaska,

267
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.530
but don't worry because the weatherman said that it should stay above freezing

268
00:16:26.531 --> 00:16:27.460
for most of the day.

269
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.570
<v 1>Wonder hell God puts up a front to hide her sensitive side.</v>

270
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.030
<v 0>Oh, he could see past my mean blustery from here into my soft mushy</v>

271
00:16:37.031 --> 00:16:39.850
interior in tore him.

272
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.130
<v 1>But while the other kids can dismiss that front,</v>

273
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.510
it's just hell they're being Helga. Arno gets extremely frustrated with it.

274
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.450
He's committed to seeing everyone's potential for goodness.

275
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.310
So he views Helga's meanness as a choice, not a permanent personality trait.

276
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:54.970
Why can't.

277
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.220
<v 0>You just admit it? You're not. This means so is.</v>

278
00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.600
<v 1>He right? Or just naive?</v>

279
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.050
And if there is hope for all the wounded people in this crazy city,

280
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.250
what's the best way to help them find their inner goodness in the long run.

281
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.610
The show seems to back Arnold's optimistic view of people.

282
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.100
We see this clearly in Arnold's Christmas,

283
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.840
which ends with Helga redeeming her earlier selfish attitude. In this case,

284
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.610
by giving away her covenant,

285
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.900
Nancy spumoni is no boots to help honor reunite a family.

286
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.610
And though it's never easy.

287
00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.200
The show depicts many other characters learning to grow past their shortcomings

288
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.300
and embody their best qualities.

289
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.160
Whether that's chocolate boy finding the strength to kick the beans are still

290
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.980
good. Finding the courage to leave is to

291
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.840
Arnold's journey, convincing stoop kid.

292
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.820
The overcome his fear is one of the clearest examples of what the show is really

293
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.270
namely finding an unexpected solution to the problems of stress

294
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.080
and isolation caused by busy cramped city lives.

295
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.830
After trying and failing to train stoop kid, to leave his support.

296
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.470
Arnold inspires him to be courageous by telling him about the world beyond

297
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:07.370
honest stew.

298
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.580
<v 3>You may have your little stoop here, but beyond this stoop,</v>

299
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.800
there's a whole bunch of other stoops.

300
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.023
<v 1>In other words,</v>

301
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.200
Arnold seems to be arguing that the solution to isolation and fear the way to

302
00:18:18.201 --> 00:18:22.640
bring out our best selves is through participation in the wider world and

303
00:18:22.641 --> 00:18:26.450
community. The one that we're often cut off from as a result of urban,

304
00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:30.800
psychogeography the idea that community participation is vital for the

305
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.960
wellbeing of the individual and that communities therefore have value in and of

306
00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:39.950
themselves comes back again and again, throughout the series, Hey Arnold,

307
00:18:39.951 --> 00:18:44.060
the movie which pits Arnold and his friends against a real estate developer,

308
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.590
who plans to tear down the old neighborhood and replace it with a shopping mall.

309
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:53.810
It's basically an 80 minute screen against gentrification is framed here as the

310
00:18:53.811 --> 00:18:57.350
destruction of a valuable established community. For me, a problem.

311
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.890
<v 3>What's wrong with old things. Some old things are great. Yeah.</v>

312
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.150
Like Mrs. Vitello.

313
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.620
<v 1>This conflict is very much in line with what we mentioned before.</v>

314
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.460
That whole thing situation is Aden most about urban areas.

315
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.200
The prioritization of profit over say the housing of an entire

316
00:19:18.201 --> 00:19:21.920
neighborhood as the board wrote in society of the spectacle.

317
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.180
Urbanism is capitalism seizure of the natural and the human environment

318
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.050
developing logically into absolute domination.

319
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:35.150
Capitalism can and must now remake the totality of space into its own

320
00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:36.380
setting. One major way.

321
00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:40.490
He knows that they do this is by building large shopping centers.

322
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.090
<v 6>He wants to buy up the whole neighborhood so we can knock it down and put up a</v>

323
00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:45.140
fancy mall.

324
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.890
<v 1>Construction project would effectively displaced Arnold's community.</v>

325
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.220
And if Hillwood looks anything like your typical city,

326
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.720
it would fling them farther away from the city center where they likely work

327
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.250
sending them on farther commutes and generally making their lives worse.

328
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.510
Also it would kill a community they've spent years developing

329
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.400
naturally Arnold's horrified because this community is an

330
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.940
integral part of his identity. And that's actually healthy.

331
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.070
According to a group of thinkers, loosely labeled communitarian philosophers,

332
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.770
mainly by their opponents. In a nutshell,

333
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.730
communitarianism pushes back against classical liberal philosophies,

334
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.570
conception of the individual as a completely separate actor,

335
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.240
pursuing their own rational self-interest.

336
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:37.220
Instead communitarianism argues that our relationships and communities have a

337
00:20:37.221 --> 00:20:41.870
huge impact on our identities and that we are to bear that in mind while living

338
00:20:41.871 --> 00:20:46.010
our lives and structuring our societies. Hey, Arnold seems to agree,

339
00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:50.830
arguing that the way to live in an alienated world like ours is a form

340
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:53.530
friendships and families with the people around us,

341
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.520
even if they're just as weird and messed up as we are the tenants at the

342
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:01.810
boarding house represent one such improvise family for as much as Oscar,

343
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.550
Ernie and Mr. Wynn and Arnold grandparents may argue about noise and bathroom

344
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:09.190
access. They also play games together,

345
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.490
share advice and even exchange Christmas presents.

346
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.680
They're far from a traditional family,

347
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.570
but the human need for familial ties is so strong that they find ways to make it

348
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:22.570
work. Even with all your annoying thinking habits to treat.

349
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.670
<v 0>This. I love you guys.</v>

350
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.290
<v 1>The same ethos is at the heart of the flood in which the students and Mr.</v>

351
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:34.210
Simmons class must overcome their differences to survive a natural disaster and

352
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:35.110
save their teachers.

353
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:40.350
<v 0>Life. We were together and became a tribe. I am so proud of you all.</v>

354
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.460
<v 1>And in one Thanksgiving,</v>

355
00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:45.600
special Arnold and Helga flee their family dinners and crashed their teacher,

356
00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:47.190
Mr. Simmons celebration.

357
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.760
But as guests also start fighting and the kids quickly realized that his

358
00:21:50.761 --> 00:21:52.650
Thanksgiving is no better than their own,

359
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.940
but even as he admits to how horribly dinner is going, Mr. Simmons and sister,

360
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.790
there is something worth fighting for this hot mess of a good thing.

361
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.430
<v 0>I know that this isn't perfect,</v>

362
00:22:02.431 --> 00:22:05.340
but those special people out there are the ones that I love.

363
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.840
And every year it's my little project to get them together in a room and try to

364
00:22:09.841 --> 00:22:11.850
make us all thankful for the things we've got.

365
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.310
<v 1>So while Hey, Arnold doesn't assist that families,</v>

366
00:22:14.311 --> 00:22:16.560
communities and neighborhoods are worth preserving.

367
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.470
It never pretends that human relationships are easy.

368
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.300
The Hill one as in real life,

369
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.110
they're often hard to supporting and frustrating as all hell.

370
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.190
In response to this fact here, I'm going to take some sort of fatalist stance,

371
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.780
suggesting that since we're all stuck in this crowd of nuts, weirdos and freaks,

372
00:22:33.781 --> 00:22:35.040
that is the human race.

373
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.090
We might as well learn to be nice to each other and enjoy our time together.

374
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.860
But what do you think wisecrack?

375
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.980
