00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>This video is brought to you by surf shark. VPN.</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.820
<v 0>Hey wise, crack Greg here today.</v>

4
00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:14.000
We're going to talk about why you don't really need to be afraid of some AI

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.840
fueled robot with AKA's farms coming to snuff you out.

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.040
Now really talk about the Terminator series tends to center around fears of the

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.210
calming robo apocalypse. You know, the day when a bunch of roided up,

8
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.400
our D finally come for us.

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.710
<v 1>Absolutely will not stop ever until you are</v>

10
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:34.370
dead.

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.540
<v 0>But what if the Terminator is really wanting us not about some far fetched</v>

12
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:42.260
apocalypse, but a more subtle danger that's already here.

13
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.280
We'll explain in this wisecrack condition on the Terminator series.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.030
And of course, spoilers ahead. But before we get into it,

15
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:53.720
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor surf shark VPN.

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.560
It's no secret that you don't have much privacy on the internet these days.

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.250
However, there is a way that you can protect yourself online,

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.440
and that is by using a VPN,

19
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.680
a VPN sends your information through an encrypted tunnel.

20
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.950
So you can safely use your passwords without the fear of hackers,

21
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:11.150
stealing your information.

22
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.340
A VPN can also protect you from targeted ads and other pesky data trackers.

23
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.350

34
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.930
And now a quick recap,

35
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.490
when an AI system designed to run America's defense network becomes self-aware.

36
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.230
It decides the safest course of action is to nuke the hell out of humanity.

37
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.080
And honestly, I get it anyway.

38
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.150
After the mushroom clouds disperse a war rages on between man and machine until

39
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.350
the robot army decides to send a Terminator back in town with one mission,

40
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.170
kill this perfectly nice lady, Sarah Connor,

41
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.560
before she gives birth to the future leader of the human resistance,

42
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.520
but humans from the future send back their own soldier to protect her and the

43
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:36.200
races on who will get the Sarah Connor first and change the course of history.

44
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.771
Come with me.

45
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:40.700
If you want to live subsequent films in the series have given us good Arnold,

46
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:43.070
bad on all and stay at home. Dad on him.

47
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.240
<v 1>His name is Mateo.</v>

48
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.320
I met his mother Alicia a few months after they killed John.

49
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.120
<v 0>But each new installment revolves around the same basic premise and evil AI</v>

50
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:54.410
tries to kill us all.

51
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.980
And a robo soldier goes back in time to try and save us all.

52
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.240
Even people drink hot coffee through straws.

53
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.930
While the seagulls are really leaned into the Saifai action thing.

54
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.340
The original is essentially a horror film, like many classics classes.

55
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.170
It sees a cold-hearted human, but not human entity stalking relentlessly.

56
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.290
After what film scholars call a final girl,

57
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.940
AKA the female character faded this vibe, all the villains books.

58
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.350
I'm like other horror antagonists, but exactly like Mark Zuckerberg,

59
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.300
the Terminator puts the cold ruthless precision of a computer into a human

60
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:33.700
body. It's creepy as hell.

61
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.680
This basic juxtaposition between humanity and dead eyed machine like logic is

62
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.840
what makes the movie so scary.

63
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.170
It also makes you wonder what Siri's really capable of.

64
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.600
<v 2>I could kill you and they'd never find the body.</v>

65
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.710
<v 0>Personally that's way scarier to me than global nuclear war,</v>

66
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.550
but let's put killer robots aside because the real strip of the series

67
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.250
commentary is the way it highlights the subtle,

68
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.340
dangerous already posed by existing technology.

69
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.000
The original movie was set and released in 1984,

70
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.410
at which point our daily lives have become increasingly automated and

71
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:12.880
increasingly relying on machines and it's is dependence on technology that

72
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:17.200
primes many of the Terminator's victims for the kill take Sarah's roommate,

73
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:21.610
ginger. While her boyfriend is being attacked by our Burley, Android, and dater,

74
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.000
she remains blissfully unaware. Thanks to the headphones,

75
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.580
blaring those irresistible eighties tunes

76
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.100
Cut the 2020.

77
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:36.540
And we're so dependent on technology that I for one have basically high glued my

78
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:40.110
AirPods and some of my heroes and not to sound like a bloomer,

79
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:45.060
but I'd say that spending most of our lives on screens often cuts us off from

80
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.140
the outside world.

81
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.190
And it's not just about how you almost got hit by a car cause you were sexting

82
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.300
either. It's also,

83
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:55.260
our technology stops working for us throughout the first movie.

84
00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:59.970
The communication technology that the characters rely on constantly fails. Them.

85
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.270
Phone calls are missed voicemails, go unchecked.

86
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.800
And Ginger's boyfriend embarrassed himself by launching into a steamy monologue

87
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.330
to his girlfriend's roommate.

88
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.950
<v 2>Off of my team, who is, this.</v>

89
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.000
<v 0>Happens to the best of us. I've been there in matters. Believe me.</v>

90
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.420
And even after the police know that Sarah is in trouble,

91
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:25.380
they still can't get off.

92
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.490
<v 2>Call her. I just called call.</v>

93
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.780
<v 0>Her again. And when she tries to call them.</v>

94
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.050
<v 2>Please keep transferring me around. I'm going to give him another try.</v>

95
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.591
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:39.000
The web of connections that is our safety net comes unraveled in a time of real

97
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:43.320
crisis. And that was just the 1984. These days.

98
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.070
If the internet went out, the world would probably collapse in the chaos.

99
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.810
Basically when so much of our communication takes place from a distance and as

100
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:56.010
mediated by technology, we're left vulnerable in more ways than one.

101
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.770
The scene that was has sex with her boyfriend without removing her headphones

102
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.150
can even be read as a comic indication of how technology has come to interrupt.

103
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.670
Even our most intimate forms of contact.

104
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.680
A study from last year found that 20% of air pot users have enjoyed a

105
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.510
similar experience hopefully while listening to this American life. However,

106
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:21.530
the recording that plays out in response to the polices on answered calls

107
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.810
indicates an even deeper problem.

108
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.100
<v 2>Hi there, you're talking to a machine.</v>

109
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.320
<v 0>The T 800 tracks Sarah down by impersonating her mother on the phone showing how</v>

110
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.820
easily good technology can trick us today.

111
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.130
Twitter bots and chatbots are like, uh,

112
00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:46.450
both effective because they give us the sensation of speaking to a real human

113
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:51.310
being. Of course, whether they're being used around us up or calm us down,

114
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.540
they elicit an emotional response and that response can be exploited.

115
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.720
And this is a fear that becomes more potent every year.

116
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.250
The TA hundreds vocal mimicry, might've been by back in 1984,

117
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.040
but it's eerily real. And the age of deep fakes.

118
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.590
<v 2>I don't want to have to say because who knows when you're going to run into</v>

119
00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:09.460
these people.

120
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.600
<v 0>Just last year and the AI was able to impersonate Joe Rogan's voice well enough</v>

121
00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:17.920
to convince listeners.

122
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.610
They were speaking with the podcast to himself at the same time,

123
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.300
visual deep fakes are becoming an easy way to spread very convincing

124
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:26.320
misinformation.

125
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.420
<v 2>President Trump is a total and complete.</v>

126
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.250
Now you see, I would never say these things,

127
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.530
at least not in a public address,

128
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.300
but someone else would someone like

129
00:07:40.301 --> 00:07:40.840
Jordan.

130
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.950
<v 0>Okay, cool. These days,</v>

131
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:46.540
fears of being walled into a false sense of security by computer tricks is

132
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.940
very, very real. And Samantha,

133
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.530
I don't care if you're actually a 71 year old inmate named rod. Well,

134
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:58.510
we have with special girl and I'll never regret it. And of course,

135
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.010
unlike in 1984,

136
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.580
computers are now integral to the fabric of our daily lives.

137
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.070
This reality was explored in a fun,

138
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.660
if not completely successful sequel from last year, Terminator,

139
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:12.400
dark fate. Once again,

140
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.900
the series tries to warn us about the very real technological threats we face

141
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:17.820
today. Threats,

142
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.350
McKinsey Davis's robot arm can possibly protect us from dark fate puts its

143
00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:28.090
hero, Danny in much the same position as Sarah and John Connor before her

144
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.920
aware that a single minded killing machine is on Hertz rail and desperate to

145
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:34.330
disappear. Of course,

146
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.390
it's basically impossible to get off the grid when the grid is.

147
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.720
<v 2>Now, anyone with a phone is a walking sensor platform. However,</v>

148
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.360
intersection every gas station in seven 11 has cameras.

149
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.350
Nobody walks through this world without leaving a digital trail, a mile wide.

150
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.460
<v 0>Throughout the movie.</v>

151
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:55.740
The red nine is able to track its prey by tapping the huge web internet

152
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.730
connected devices that now span the globe and the original film.

153
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.960
The T 800 happens to be in Sarah's apartment. When she leaves a voicemail,

154
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:05.310
revealing her location.

155
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.200
<v 2>Pick up if you're there, I'm at this place.</v>

156
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.590
<v 0>Nine doesn't have to rely on such old tricks.</v>

157
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.200
Thanks to our smartphones and other devices.

158
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.610
We all leave a Godzilla sized digital footprint everywhere we go,

159
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.640
while it may save us from getting stranded like this,

160
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.040
it also makes it impossible to hide.

161
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.930
Why them from facial recognition technology or from Facebook harvesting are very

162
00:09:32.931 --> 00:09:37.670
personal data and short on water, which computers track our every move.

163
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.130
Isn't the stuff, a futuristic Sapphire.

164
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.780
It's a world we and Danny already living in.

165
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.850
<v 2>Hey, might as well be wearing a tracking bracelet.</v>

166
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.050
<v 0>But it's not all stolen personal data and targeted Facebook ads.</v>

167
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.500
The Terminator films have always centered around the most terrifying

168
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:56.180
technological risk of all.

169
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.590
What happens when computers are the ones with the guns.

170
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.580
And before you laugh at the thought of your room,

171
00:10:04.581 --> 00:10:06.920
but pulling a gun or you consider this,

172
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.880
the Korean border is being patrolled by robotics, centuries,

173
00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:14.150
equipped with actual machine guns, that'll be cleared.

174
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.230
The manufacturers maintained that the bot still requires human authorization to

175
00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:22.340
fire. So we are yet in a world with fully automated death machines.

176
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.850
The thing she was seen headed that way as in dark fate,

177
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.760
we witnessed an increase in use of lethal drones,

178
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.070
particularly by the United States,

179
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.330
which moves us further towards a more mechanized vision of warfare.

180
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.141
Recently,

181
00:10:36.141 --> 00:10:40.970
the U S agency that researches and develops emerging warfare technology

182
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.320
announced that it has successfully tested and autonomous drone swarm.

183
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.310
<v 2>It's a Bob killing machine. Oh great.</v>

184
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.470
That's great.

185
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.580
<v 0>So even if we won't be seeing anything like a T 800 stumping down the street any</v>

186
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:56.414
day soon,

187
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.440
the military possibilities of our increasingly advanced computers should

188
00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:02.180
certainly give us pause,

189
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.620
which brings us back to the real problem with our continued panic about

190
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.610
interconnected networks of murder and leather clamp kill bots.

191
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.770
Not only does it freak us out,

192
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.630
but it also distracts us from the much more concrete dangers we face today,

193
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.680
the world, the pigging and the Terminator isn't coming any time soon,

194
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.790
but there are plenty of potential. Dystopia is leaking land. And along the way,

195
00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:28.070
if we're not careful from the privacy threat,

196
00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:32.090
you carry around in your pocket to that deep fake of you cheating on your spouse

197
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:32.990
with their dentists,

198
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.880
the computers we should be wary of already here before all the time is spent

199
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.550
teaching us to be terrified of anything with wires.

200
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:45.200
The Terminator series always ends on a hopeful note because technological

201
00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:47.390
progress is not preordained.

202
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.390
We get to choose what shaped the world of tomorrow will take.

203
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.860
Especially if you're Elon Musk come, man,

204
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.680
don't be lying at its core.

205
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.920
The Terminator series is about what technology can do to us.

206
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.510
If we're not careful and about questioning the role computers should play in our

207
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:05.344
lives.

208
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.270
It's great that we can ask Alexa to set a timer for four 20 to take our

209
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.104
vitamins.

210
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.310
It's less great when we were linked with all of our privacy in the process.

211
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.540
So what do you think wise crack, how far is too far when it comes to computers?

212
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.770
So we keep pressing forward and hope things turn out more next generation and

213
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:24.640
judgment day,

214
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.240
or should we be a little more worried about the rise of the machines?

215
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.410
