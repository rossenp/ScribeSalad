00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.400
<v 0>This video is brought to you by the Ridge wallet.</v>

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.780
<v 1>Hey, wisecrack, Greg here, we're making a shortlist of really funny things.</v>

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.980
Chronic despair and unrelenting anxiety probably don't make the cut.

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.850
So why are so many comedians these days talking about their mental health and

5
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:22.550
more importantly, why is it so freaking funny.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.970
<v 2>That I was gaining weight because my belt stopped fitting around my neck.</v>

7
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:27.200
The same way that it used to.

8
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.880
<v 1>Well, indeed over the last few years, and especially since Robin Williams,</v>

9
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:33.710
tragic death in 2014,

10
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.190
we've seen more and more comments make material out of this struggles with

11
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:41.360
depression and anxiety and other mental health issues. Pete Davidson,

12
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:42.194
for example,

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.220
has made a running gag of his mental health issues on Saturday night live.

14
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.050
Oh no, no.

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.840
<v 2>No. I was born depressed, but it might make me feel better.</v>

16
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.130
<v 0>If I was on TV more.</v>

17
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.150
<v 1>And a part of Nancherla has done the same thing with her anxiety.</v>

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.041
<v 2>Anxiety.</v>

19
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:02.780
The way I would describe it is like there's an edgy improv group in your

20
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:03.614
brain.

21
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.000
<v 1>Gentlemen,</v>

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.610
Laney has been cracking jokes about his own mental health struggles and

23
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:10.100
addiction issues. Since early on in his career.

24
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.820
<v 2>I actually just quit drinking a couple months ago because, Oh,</v>

25
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:16.400
I'm not exactly slap happy about it. Myself.

26
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.721
<v 1>Meanwhile,</v>

27
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.860
comics like bill Hader and Bo Burnham have been open about their experiences

28
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.420
with performance anxiety.

29
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.040
<v 0>To come to terms with your anxiety on the road.</v>

30
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.640
You know what I mean? In front of thousands of people tonight, it was very,

31
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:32.474
very abstract.

32
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.040
<v 1>Comedy might not seem like the most obvious media for exploring mental health</v>

33
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:40.100
struggles. Given that for most of its history, it's peddled,

34
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:44.690
largely equipped punchlines and gags purely for laughter sick.

35
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.360
I wish they made fajita cologne because that stuff smells good.

36
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.880
But this recent shift raises some interesting questions for one thing.

37
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.790
How do we get from Bob hubs down? One-liners.

38
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.640
<v 2>I went to the dentist this morning only had a dollar. What happened?</v>

39
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.540
I had to get bucked teeth.

40
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.240
<v 1>The comedians dissecting the most intimate details of their mental health</v>

41
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.930
struggles.

42
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.790
<v 2>If I had had a gun right here,</v>

43
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.370
I would have just brought it up one smooth movement, just like, Oh,

44
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:16.360
they have French crust pizza dude, dude, dude, dude.

45
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 1>Change a good thing are jokes about anxiety, depression,</v>

46
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:23.330
and other mental health issues.

47
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.630
Just a new way to get a quick laugh out of a tough situation,

48
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.910
or is there something much deeper going on?

49
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.650
Let's find out in this wise crack additional comedy and mental health. Now,

50
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:37.700
before we dive into a very serious discussion of some extremely funny people,

51
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.180
I want to give a quick shout out to the people who will help us keep the cameras

52

66

but 10% off now,

67
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.280
back to the shelf while it's no longer particularly shocking to hear a comedian

68
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.360
joke about depression,

69
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.560
it's worth remembering that the reason focus on mental health and stand up is

70
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:43.870
pretty unprecedented. For most of this history.

71
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.890
Standup comedy was less about sharing, funny confessional stories,

72
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.840
our observations on stage and more about crafting and delivering clever setups

73
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:53.710
and punchlines.

74
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.540
<v 2>My friend George is a radio announcer. And when he walks under a bridge,</v>

75
00:03:57.541 --> 00:03:58.770
you can't hear him talk.

76
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.970
<v 1>In other words, comics in the early to mid 20th century,</v>

77
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.770
largely focused on laughter for its own sake and then necessarily ground their

78
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:10.290
material and their real life experiences.

79
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.700
Comics like Bob hope along with Jack Benny and Milton Berle built their sets

80
00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:16.260
around rapid fire jokes.

81
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920
While their setups often made references to their personal lives.

82
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.420
This was only incidental. The real goal wasn't bearing their soul on stage.

83
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.520
It was landing a surprising punchline.

84
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.320
<v 2>When I arrived at the airport,</v>

85
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:33.090
LBJ gave me a one of reception at 21 gun salute and I've got the powder

86
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.990
burns to prove it.

87
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.770
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

88
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.850
the comedy of this era tended to be escapist more about taking a break from

89
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:39.900
life's hardships,

90
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.100
then engaging them head on key to that comedic escape is something called

91
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.330
in-congruent that is deliberately creating a gap between what the audience is

92
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:51.510
expecting to hear and what actually comes out of the comedians.

93
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:52.800
Mouth philosophers,

94
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:57.420
as disparate as content Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard have theorized that

95
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.780
congruency is the main ingredient in generating laughter.

96
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.070
We laugh when something disrupts our usual mental patterns and subverts our

97
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.030
expectations.

98
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.320
The classic example is a person who slips on a banana pill while walking the

99
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:14.640
expectation here is the person can walk. We are very used to seeing this.

100
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.030
We are not used to seeing the person eat instead. Thus,

101
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.640
the incongruity of course has been,

102
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.780
has become so cliche that it's practically an expectation in its own, right?

103
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.410
Which opens up the floor for new banana pill and later gags

104
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.910
in pursuit of in congruent. Some comedians got downright weird with their sets,

105
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.320
creating completely nonsensical material in an attempt to bug the audience's

106
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:44.370
expectations. Stand-up comedians like Charlie Callas for instance,

107
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.900
made a decades long career out of interrupting his own stories with bizarre

108
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.960
nonsensical noises and facial expressions.

109
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.490
<v 2>Even more abstractly.</v>

110
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.410
<v 1>Eighties prop comic Gallagher built entire sets around smashing watermelons with</v>

111
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.710
the hammer and pulling large things out of a giant couch.

112
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.300
[inaudible] Hey,

113
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.960
it was a different time audiences attending these kinds of shows probably

114
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:22.970
weren't expecting a lot in the way of substance,

115
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.430
but even before Gallagher's watermelon,

116
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:29.540
smashing comedy was evolving to do more than just dish out jokes.

117
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.760
Beginning of the 1950s and sixties,

118
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.760
a so-called new wave of standup comics like Lenny,

119
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.870
Bruce and George Carlin begin to push the boundaries of what could be said on

120
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:43.670
stage by incorporating crude humor and social satire into their sets.

121
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.300
Carla, for instance, was famously arrested on obscenity charges,

122
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.680
following a televised routine about the dirty words. One wasn't supposed to say.

123
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.630
<v 3>Current kids.</v>

124
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.370
<v 1>In a similar vein comics like Sam Kennison use their stage time to attack social</v>

125
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:03.850
norms and institutions generally considered sacred.

126
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.770
<v 3>Well, Michael, if you ever think about getting married,</v>

127
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:07.180
if you ever think you've met the right woman,

128
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:10.290
you want to settle down and change your life. Do me a favor, man.

129
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.913
Remember this face.

130
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.960
<v 1>[Inaudible] more so than earlier comedians.</v>

131
00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:21.220
These comics acted as cultural critics pointing out perceived hypocrisy

132
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.300
throughout history.

133
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:26.470
This has been a major function of comedy and laughter as scholar Lawrence emits

134
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:29.680
writes the stand-up comic acts as our comic spokesperson,

135
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.060
a mediator and articulator of our culture and our contemporary

136
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:38.530
anthropologists. More broadly mince contends that in certain contexts,

137
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.370
the stand-up comic is granted permission to express feelings that will be

138
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:44.680
difficult to share outside the comedy club.

139
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.630
<v 3>You are Satan spawn,</v>

140
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.580
filling the world with bile and garbage you are and you are kill yourself.

141
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.650
It's the only way to save your soul.

142
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:59.080
<v 1>While performing a skill comic and enacting audiences frustrations with the very</v>

143
00:07:59.081 --> 00:08:02.920
real difficulties of relationships, politics and so on.

144
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.420
And this way they can provide insights into our shared human shortcomings

145
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.081
insights.

146
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:12.520
That would be entirely unacceptable to share at the company picnic still for the

147
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:13.210
most part,

148
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.770
new wave comics tended to direct their criticism outward at the broader society

149
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.320
rather than attempting introspection. And that's,

150
00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:22.480
what's so interesting about the present moment,

151
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.490
which we will playfully dove the new new age of comedy more so than ever before.

152
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.110
Comics are turning a Carlin as critical eye inward to comment on themselves and

153
00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:32.944
their community.

154
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.810
<v 3>Yeah, I think, I think it's hard for black men,</v>

155
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:38.560
especially to talk about depression because we have so many cool words available

156
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:40.540
to us to undermine how we really feel. You know.

157
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.071
<v 1>As a result,</v>

158
00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:45.790
they're able to broach hard truths that for years have been off the table,

159
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.980
even for the boldest of comics.

160
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.450
<v 3>And trust me when I say this,</v>

161
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.470
nothing is scarier than having to fight your own mind, but.

162
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.450
<v 1>Is this necessarily a good thing that brings us to one of the central conflicts</v>

163
00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:02.310
in this new new age, namely is laughter a the best medicine, Hey.

164
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.040
<v 2>Uh, you know, everything you do is going to end in an isolation and entropy.</v>

165
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:10.850
So what's the point I'm like, you're right. You went again, depression.

166
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.540
<v 1>Or be an unhealthy coping mechanism.</v>

167
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.960
<v 2>Depressed. I'm looking for any excuse to not get help.</v>

168
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.630
And the fact that some of my heroes were

169
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.350
messed up was a justification for it.

170
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.930
<v 1>That clips from laughing matters,</v>

171
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.560
a recent documentary about comedy and mental health in it,

172
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.950
famous actors and comics, including Sarah Silverman,

173
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.570
Wayne Brady and Rainn Wilson speak candidly about the mental health issues

174
00:09:38.571 --> 00:09:42.680
they've dealt with and explore the role that Kali has played in their struggles.

175
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:47.090
The documentary explores the potential harm of using comedy to escape one's

176
00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:48.260
mental health problems.

177
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.070
<v 2>I think performing can be a temporary high, but like all temporary highs.</v>

178
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.570
It doesn't last. And you can chase that high night after night after night,

179
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.220
but eventually going,

180
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.310
gonna be club is not open or you're going to have a night off and you're going

181
00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:04.070
to have to deal with what happens in the silence.

182
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.450
<v 1>Like any other addiction, the high of a great performance contemporarily masks,</v>

183
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:12.590
the pain of depression, anxiety and so on, but it does.

184
00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:15.950
So without actually helping to solve the underlying issues.

185
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.020
And in some cases it can make them worse than you.

186
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.330
<v 2>Are thinking about doing comedy as a substitute for therapy</v>

187
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.880
that's doesn't work. I tried, I tried for a long time.

188
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:31.970
<v 1>Work to put it bluntly.</v>

189
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.380
The documentary suggest that comedy and laughter have been unproductive and even

190
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:38.090
destructive for many comedians,

191
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.870
a way to tune out from a life that's falling apart. If that's true,

192
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.790
is it fixable and specifically,

193
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.460
is there a more constructive way to make people laugh?

194
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.440
One that's less about avoiding painful truths and more about facing them to find

195
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:55.640
out. We can turn to a guy who's not exactly known for its punchy one-liners

196
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.710
philosopher and horse enthusiastic Cratchit nature in general nature

197
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.550
had pretty serious beef with laughter because he viewed it as a potential threat

198
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.590
to our quest for self-actualization as scholar Mark Weitz notes need to thought

199
00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:12.950
the most important human pursuit was embracing our future,

200
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.450
our desires and our power in the face of life's uncertainties for him.

201
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.030
Laughter undercuts this pursuit. Indeed.

202
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:22.220
According to weeks' interpretation of nature,

203
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.640
laughter off its ability to ground us in the present moment.

204
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.350
By overwhelming us with giggle fits and good feelings can distract from the all

205
00:11:30.351 --> 00:11:32.120
important philosophical question,

206
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.770
constantly striving to improve ourselves in order to build a better future,

207
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.150
to put it another way.

208
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.190
Laughter has a tendency to lift us momentarily out of time by cutting tension

209
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.810
and poking holes in the stories we construct for ourselves. Laughter.

210
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:48.710
In other words,

211
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.820
it's a loss of the creative tension that the need gen hero needs to construct a

212
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.520
narrative of their life.

213
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.440
A waste of a vital resource while Nisha is hardly an expert in laws and

214
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:03.670
stand up comedy. As we know it totally didn't exist in 19th century Germany.

215
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.290
He does have a point worth considering as we seen a lot of successful comedy

216
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.120
works by creating an incongruity,

217
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.710
pointing out gaps between expectation and reality. In other words,

218
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.570
undercutting various narratives.

219
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.480
We tell ourselves about the way things ought to go.

220
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.870
Charlie Callas does this by literally cutting himself off.

221
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.040
Bali tells a brief story and Sam Kinison does this by poking holes in the

222
00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:31.090
societal narrative of a happy loving marriage in various ways.

223
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.560
Comedians have historically generated a lot of laughter by disrupting the flow

224
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:38.950
of personal and societal narratives. Going by nature.

225
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.210
We might consider this a bad thing because while comedians are deconstructing

226
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.290
old and useless narratives, they're not necessarily offering new,

227
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:51.310
more productive ones to take their place and to bring it back to mental health

228
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.510
and Nietzsche and terms.

229
00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:56.770
Comedy has failed some pretty funny people by offering them a way to temporarily

230
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:59.980
undercut the narrative of their own lives in the process.

231
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.180
They can numb out and avoid facing their own existential dread and the mental

232
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:07.750
health issues that might come with it. A lot of existing standup comedy.

233
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.820
In other words, confirms niches,

234
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:14.470
worst fears about laughter potentially harmful effects on the human spirit.

235
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.170
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

236
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.880
<v 1>We can't help, but wonder if me too,</v>

237
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.510
might've been more okay with laughter if he spent his time joking with his

238
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:27.300
friends instead of crying alone in the woods,

239
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.490
which Hey you do you Frederick, nevertheless, this criticism raises a question.

240
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.330
Chicagoans,

241
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.320
try to use laughter to confront their problems rather than to escape from them.

242
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.190
And what might such a new approach be while we have no evidence that any of the

243
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:44.160
comedians interviewed and laughing matters, dig meta,

244
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.970
they do outline with a more constructive approach to comedy might look like

245
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.420
specifically an approach that transforms their struggles. It's a,

246
00:13:51.421 --> 00:13:54.600
something of a greater value rather than just fodder for that.

247
00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.090
<v 2>We all have these kind of things that happened to us and we can get through</v>

248
00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:05.090
them, you know, we can get through it and transform it and uh, and use it.

249
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.900
<v 1>Trauma and tragedy. According to these comics are not merely things to laugh at,</v>

250
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.280
even if it feels good,

251
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.870
rather they're the raw materials that comedians can use to craft entirely new

252
00:14:15.871 --> 00:14:19.350
narratives instead of merely shredding apart out dated ones.

253
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.861
<v 2>You know,</v>

254
00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:24.270
if you're an artist who has a chance to say something that might actually

255
00:14:24.271 --> 00:14:28.260
connect with people or help people, you don't take that chance.

256
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.100
What good aren't you?

257
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.730
<v 1>This approach to comedy is distinctly Nietzschean. Mark.</v>

258
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.620
Wietz contends that in his later work,

259
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.210
the philosopher made a kind of uneasy peace with laughter by challenging his

260
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.250
readers to will a new kind of laughter one which leads us both amused and

261
00:14:47.251 --> 00:14:50.040
philosophically elevated to put it another way,

262
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.140
need to believe that a constructive self-affirming laughter was possible,

263
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.570
but had yet to be realized in his own time,

264
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.560
he challenged his readers to invent a new form of laughter that would support

265
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:05.180
her road striving in the face of adversity rather than denigrating such efforts

266
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.860
as being pointless and silly.

267
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.820
And we'd argue that the standup comic who uses their struggles with mental

268
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:14.690
health as material is helping to make that new laughter a reality.

269
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.540
When a comic crafts, a good story about their struggles,

270
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.040
they are just entertaining.

271
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.330
They're also creating a heroic narrative that shows them facing off against the

272
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:27.110
real challenges of being human. And in the case of mental health,

273
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.020
that means the difficulty of being completely reliant on a blob of electrified

274
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.150
goop that frequently malfunctions. In other words,

275
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.020
they're responding the neatest challenge by generating laughter that brings

276
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:43.940
audiences and themselves into direct contact with the past and the future

277
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.120
rather than merely escaping until the hilarity of the present.

278
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.310
We can see this in the work of Sarah Silverman,

279
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.980
like the other comedians interviewed in laughing matters.

280
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.660
She cites her difficult childhood as a sort of origin story for a comedy career.

281
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.800
Then this way she takes a direct look at her past rather than running from it.

282
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.920
<v 2>A hundred percent of comedians become comedians because somewhere in their</v>

283
00:16:05.921 --> 00:16:09.790
childhood, they needed to be funny in order to survive.

284
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.710
<v 1>Her refusal to use laughter as a way of covering up as traumas pops up again,</v>

285
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.970
when Silverman describes what happened to the doctor who prescribed her Xanax as

286
00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:19.720
a teenager.

287
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.460
<v 2>The psychiatrist who originally put me on it hung</v>

288
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:28.120
himself. I mean,

289
00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:30.490
I can't just skate by that. It's crazy.

290
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.000
<v 1>This house Silverman laughs and smiles while telling the story,</v>

291
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.920
but refuses to dismiss her psychiatrist suicide as something inconsequential,

292
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.090
she can acknowledge the irony and the situation and even chuckle at it without

293
00:16:43.091 --> 00:16:46.630
denying the traumatic effect that these events had on her younger self.

294
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.440
What's more,

295
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.910
she explains precisely what that effect was drawing a narrative arc from her

296
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:54.610
past, through her present and into the future.

297
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.600
<v 2>He's years of torture and shame kind of became my super power.</v>

298
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.190
<v 1>Silverman is literally framing her comedy career in terms of a superhero's</v>

299
00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:06.070
origin story far from avoiding her problems.

300
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.300
Silverman embraces them as a key part of a creative process without

301
00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:14.230
romanticizing them as the sole source of her funniness depression,

302
00:17:14.231 --> 00:17:18.130
doesn't make a joke out of Silverman. Silverman makes jokes out of depression.

303
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.240
She demonstrates that comedians can transform mental health struggles from a

304
00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:27.040
taboo subject into something worth talking about even celebrating if

305
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:31.750
only for the duration of a set upon an and Charla for apart applies a similar

306
00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:33.610
technique to the topic of anxiety.

307
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.330
<v 2>I feel like it's weirder to not have anxiety than to have it.</v>

308
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.560
Cause I feel like if you're not scared, you're not paying attention. You know,

309
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.490
like I feel like if you open a newspaper day skim, maybe three headlines,

310
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:49.030
you're just like, seems cool is like what? Everything's on fire.

311
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.550
Even the newspaper is on fire. Like what are you so chill about.

312
00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.990
<v 1>Here? And then Charla frames, anxiety, not as a feeling,</v>

313
00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.320
but as the only rational response to a society that,

314
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.950
and since we posted happy photos of ourselves on Instagram,

315
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.050
while the world crumbles around us,

316
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.680
that's not to say that everyone needs to get stoked on their own depression or

317
00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:11.720
anxiety, but it's one way to deal.

318
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.860
Comics can also transform trauma into connection with other comics,

319
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.850
our audience members, or insomniacs watching grainy videos on YouTube.

320
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:25.280
<v 2>It's one of the reasons that I love being a comedian because if I can find</v>

321
00:18:25.281 --> 00:18:28.040
comedy people anywhere I go in the world and I have,

322
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.880
I know I'm going to hear good stories and I'm going to be sitting around with

323
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.350
people who are also,

324
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.690
if not okay with being at least perhaps more honest about it

325
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.040
than other folks might be.

326
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.540
<v 1>And once more Nietzschean and transforming trauma into purpose by using their</v>

327
00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:47.450
darkest moments to generate laughter these comics,

328
00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:49.970
aren't just constructing their own heroic narratives.

329
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.600
They're offering us the chance to create ours too. In other words,

330
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.050
if this guy can use human to overcome his mental health struggles,

331
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.610
then maybe there's hope for us and our friends and our cranky coworkers.

332
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.560
<v 2>The real mission is if your kid is sick or your cousin is</v>

333
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:07.394
suffering,

334
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.060
or the guy on the other side of the cubicle wall shows up and you never know

335
00:19:11.061 --> 00:19:12.620
which person you're going to get,

336
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.350
how can I make those people understand that that person is not being a

337
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.750
that day and that person's not being melodramatic and it's not because they're

338
00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:25.580
going through a phase. It's because they're.

339
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.170
<v 1>By making comedy intended to keep us alive and striving for something greater.</v>

340
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.710
These comedians are generating the kind of laughter which needs to might be

341
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.330
proud of a laughter that serves to construct rather than to tear down.

342
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.630
And that's nothing to laugh at. Nah, just kidding. That's pretty good.

343
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.560
<v 2>Funny. I don't want to be out in the wasteland fat and depressed like that.</v>

344
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.630
There's not going to be any Prozac after that.

345
00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.700
<v 1>But what do you guys think?</v>

346
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.020
Can comedy help us all become better people or should comedians just stick the

347
00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:58.640
smashing watermelons, shout out to Gallagher, let us know in the comments.

348
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.490
And since we're on the subject, if you or anyone, you know,

349
00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:03.530
is going through a hard time, get home,

350
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.670
please reach out and ask for help mostly because you deserve it inherently.

351
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.130
But also because y'all mean a lot to us.

352
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.340
And if you have a need and you can find the link and phone number for the

353
00:20:13.341 --> 00:20:18.020
national suicide prevention lifeline right here in the description below big
