2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.380
What's up wisecrack Michael,

3
00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:12.440
here to talk about a brilliant film that captivated fans,

4
00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:17.420
wooed the critics and off. And no one just kidding. I mean the live action film,

5
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:21.710
the last Airbender based on the very popular, very good Nickelodeon show,

6
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:25.810
avatar, this film seemingly had everything going for us. Great characters,

7
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.330
a compelling story. And of course, live action fire bending.

8
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.440
So why is this film more cringe, inducing than having your blood bet?

9
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.880
How does the guy who did this?

10
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.103
<v 2>I see.</v>

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.380
<v 0>Royally screw up source material as truly great as avatar. Anytime a movie,</v>

12
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:44.060
confounds our expectations like this,

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.240
we're forced to pull out our detectives pipe and start puffing until we either

14
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:50.360
get cancer or figure out what the hell happened.

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.920
<v 2>Special outfit hadn't pipe. These things mean anything to you.</v>

16
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.830
<v 0>So welcome to this widespread condition on the last Airbender,</v>

17
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.090
what went wrong and of course, spoilers ahead for a bad movie and a good show.

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.320
But before we get into it,

19
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.780
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor Skillshare.

20
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.090
When I first started writing video scripts for YouTube,

21
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.770
I was a bit unsure of myself.

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.040
It was a completely new and fun way to put my ideas into words,

23
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.650
but I wasn't sure if it was coming across on screen.

24
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.430
I researched other YouTubers and submitted script after script to our content

25
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:20.330
team for feedback,

26
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.050
I really wished I had a partner or community who knew how I was feeling about my

27
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:26.840
work. And I definitely should have looked to Skillshare.

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.650
Skillshare is an online learning community where curious creators come together

29
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:31.820

30
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.970
They offer thousands of inspiring classes for writing photography,

31
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:35.960
freelancing design,

32
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:39.500
and more members have the opportunity to share their work with their class

33
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:40.910
through projects and discussion boards.

34
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.500
I wish I had known that Skillshare offers a course literally called going viral,

35
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.430
right film and make content people share where Matt Bellicide teaches you.

membership. Now, back to the show, let's do a quick recap.

40
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.770
The film like the TV show that inspired it introduces us to siblings,

41
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.230
Saka and Katara to water tribe, youngsters,

42
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.530
whose dad's off warring against the evil fire nation. While hunting,

43
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:16.310
they stumble upon a bald kid, frozen in ice. Instead of running away screaming,

44
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:19.430
they take him under their wing. Then Mike drop.

45
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.740
It turns out he's the avatar,

46
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.450
a Messiah figure who has the ability to bend all four elements, normie benders,

47
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:29.660
like Tara can only do one loss for a century.

48
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.200
This ice kid Ang is responsible for keeping the four kingdoms in harmony.

49
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.920
But first he's got to learn how to bend all the elements, Katara, Soka,

50
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:40.250
and Ang set off on a journey to help the young avatar master his powers.

51
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.780
While also fending off the fire nation simultaneously the very moody disgraced

52
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:49.490
fire print, Zuko hatches, a plan he wants to capture Ang like some stick trophy,

53
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.150
thus restoring his reputation and winning back his father's love at which point

54
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:56.420
he will presumably stop sulking. Now, quick caveat.

55
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.310
There are a lot of things wrong with the Airbender. For one,

56
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.580
the characters are almost systematically stripped of their endearing qualities.

57
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.140
SACA sense of humor is gone and eggs. Carefree sense of fun is undetectable.

58
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.960
What's more of the stakes are never made urgent or clear enough.

59
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.410
And Ang never really struggles to beat his opponents. And importantly,

60
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.590
anchor character arc is murky at best on the show.

61
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.620
He struggles quite compellingly with guilt about the death of his people and

62
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:22.360
anxiety about the demands of his title,

63
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.420
that culminates invisible character growth in the movie,

64
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.140
his arc doesn't unfold with the same clarity and resonance there kind of just

65
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.003
isn't time.

66
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.190
Then there's the fact that the show makes a point to show a rich world with all

67
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.510
kinds of cultures and peoples,

68
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.510
whether it's the influence of Southeast Asia seen in the fire nation,

69
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.780
in UIC cultures, in the water nation, Buddhism and the air benders,

70
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.060
or even these Florida inspired swamp people.

71
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.710
<v 3>You want me to eat? Oh, slim. He's like a member of the family.</v>

72
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.510
<v 0>The richness of each culture to picked it is a big part of what fans loved about</v>

73
00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:53.460
the show. The movie on the other hand,

74
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.270
cast its protagonist in such a way as to make the central conflict look kind of

75
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:59.310
like a race war casting aside.

76
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:02.460
I think this film is actually a great lesson and one of the central problems in

77
00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:03.360
any adaptation,

78
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.020
how do you shorten a lengthy book or television series under the runtime of a

79
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:11.010
movie and still make something enjoyable? Obviously it's been done,

80
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.270
especially with books.

81
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.720
You don't hear a lot of complaints about Jurassic park fight club or a clockwork

82
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.350
orange.

83
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.580
The last Airbender in a somewhat Herculean adaptation challenge had to fit nine

84
00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:24.840
ish hours of television content into a feature film to stay somewhat faithful to

85
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:27.780
the show which it does in its own very flawed way.

86
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.090
The film needs to function like an abridged version,

87
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.570
squeezing in the most important thought events so that it starts and ends at

88
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.580
approximately the same point. Luckily,

89
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:39.000
there's one screenwriting tool that will let you breeze right through all the

90
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:41.250
complicated information exposition,

91
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.430
but it's a dangerous tool at best in storytelling.

92
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.180
Exposition is any information that flushes out the rules of the world explains

93
00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:51.600
the characters, motivations and so on. If I kill you, that's an action.

94
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.710
If I tell you,

95
00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:56.130
I want to kill you because you murdered my father that's exposition.

96
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.690
<v 4>My name is [inaudible]. You killed my father.</v>

97
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.090
Prepare to die.

98
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.380
<v 0>Sometimes exposition is extremely memorable, very iconic,</v>

99
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.160
But more often than not.

100
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:15.720
Action is more fun to watch flip through any decent book on screenwriting.

101
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.190
And you'll find a section warning,

102
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:21.690
young writers that bad exposition has an apocalyptic effect on your career.

103
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.830
Anytime a bad piece of dialogue makes you cringe because it sounds wooden falls

104
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:27.930
and maybe a little embarrassing for the actor.

105
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.600
It's often the result of poorly executed experts.

106
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.830
<v 4>You've never been stung by a bee, have you? No, no.</v>

107
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:38.130
Bees are genetically designed to recognize royalty.

108
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.020
<v 0>Proper exposition is a necessary evil in any narrative work,</v>

109
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.750
but there's an infinite number of ways to convey this information.

110
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.060
It takes us scene long montage to establish that,

111
00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:50.610
say Rocky trained a lot to get in shape it.

112
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:54.540
Would've taken two seconds to say I worked out a bunch and now I'm in shape,

113
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.820
but the universe would have been robbed of this glory. Exposition is a struggle.

114
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.380
Every screenwriter grapples with, and sometimes it can really work.

115
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.090
I don't like sand. Just kidding, maybe more like this.

116
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.690
<v 3>But until that day,</v>

117
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.490
except this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.

118
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.850
<v 0>The last Airbender, unfortunately it has a lot more of those.</v>

119
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.050
<v 2>They're eating her. I'm not going eat me</v>

120
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.860
and less of the you're a wizard Harry.

121
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.110
<v 0>Now that we've looked at some examples,</v>

122
00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:36.370
let's see how Sean Alon does exactly what every screenwriting teacher begs his

123
00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:37.840
novice students. Not to do.

124
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.100
It's telling instead of showing exposition tells us things. Yeah.

125
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.490
<v 2>This is my father.</v>

126
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.870
<v 0>Characters actions show us things. This boy running to embrace. His father,</v>

127
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:56.800
communicates everything we need to know without that pointless introduction,

128
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.130
bad movies like this one, chronically tell us things.

129
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:01.540
Instead of showing them to us.

130
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.360
<v 3>In my rate of the great library earlier this year,</v>

131
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.180
I found a scroll that tells the location of the ocean and moon spirits.

132
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.630
<v 0>Why is exposition such a narrative kick in the nuts?</v>

133
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.960
According to screenwriting guru, John York, the problem is really simple.

134
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.220
Most dramatic fiction demands plausibility for characters and not to say things

135
00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:22.990
they wouldn't say in real life. However,

136
00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:26.890
characters also need to impart essential information for the audience's benefit.

137
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.980
That is no believable. Character says hello, brother,

138
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:33.780
to whom I lent my Nintendo switch last week or wherever have you put it instead?

139
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.660
They'd probably say yo hat. Where's my switch. This though,

140
00:07:37.661 --> 00:07:41.830
a natural and reasonable reaction could leave the audience confused as Yorke

141
00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:42.640
explains.

142
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.020
Exposition can be awkward to present because it rarely occurs in real life to

143
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:48.460
bring it back to the last Airbender.

144
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.480
Nobody would actually say fire nation is here. Instead.

145
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:56.140
They'd grab the princess's hand and start running for their freaking lives.

146
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.460
Examples like this are more rampant in this film than COVID-19 at the university

147
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:03.310
of Alabama roll tide, but first a quick caveat.

148
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.980
The show avatar as amazing as it is,

149
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:08.830
is not innocent of all expository sins.

150
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.670
<v 3>Sage is tell us that the avatar is the last Airbender.</v>

151
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.400
He must be over a hundred years old by now.

152
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.800
He's had a century to master the four elements.

153
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.380
<v 0>We would never make a video ranting about it.</v>

154
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.000
There are a few reasons why first we're talking about an animated kid show that

155
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.670
explicitly does not take itself very seriously.

156
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.390
As a result, its expositional statements come off as far less.

157
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.290
<v 3>It's walking water mixed together. It means our way out.</v>

158
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.840
<v 0>Aided by its hyper expressive animation style.</v>

159
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.370
The film in contrast and perhaps out of necessity is just a lot more serious and

160
00:08:45.371 --> 00:08:48.520
it can't get away with the same childlike use of earnest exposition.

161
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.270
<v 2>All that time. Searching for a teacher I'm finally starting.</v>

162
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.160
<v 0>What's more. The show uses slightly exposition,</v>

163
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:59.910
mostly in attempts to create a coherent viewing experience and keep kids engaged

164
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.460
week after week. Even if they happen to forget the whole deal.

165
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.460
<v 3>When his dad Zuko had shown shameful weakness as</v>

166
00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:12.140
punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the avatar.

167
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.180
<v 0>Movie. On the other hand,</v>

168
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.260
regularly repeats information as if the audience is suffering from amnesia.

169
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.040
In our final defense of the show,

170
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.000
it's expository elements tend to lean hard into emotion and motivation.

171
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.530
The TV show brilliantly balances exposition with emotion information is conveyed

172
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:32.660
to characters. During scenes filled with conflict.

173
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.050
Their reactions tend to render the exposition almost invisible.

174
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.340
<v 3>You are the Airbender, your the avatar,</v>

175
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:43.820
no way.

176
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.830
<v 0>In contrast the film's expositional sins come in two distinct flavors,</v>

177
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.080
voiceover and on-screen dialogue.

178
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:55.370
Voiceover is the nuclear reactor of screenwriting exposition used with care.

179
00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:57.560
It can be incredibly effective and efficient.

180
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.900
<v 3>The man for his time and place.</v>

181
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.540
He fits right in there and that's the dude used

182
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.230
incorrectly.

183
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.850
<v 0>It'll blow up your entire script.</v>

184
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.320
<v 3>Tyrella told me Rachel was special, no termination date.</v>

185
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.130
I didn't know how long we'd have together.

186
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.690
<v 0>Screenwriting expert hall, Ackerman, warns that any time you use such a device,</v>

187
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.860
voiceover flashbacks, you are calling attention to it as a device and one,

188
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.050
you had better use it effectively. And two,

189
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.740
it had better be the best way of telling the story. If that's the case,

190
00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:33.740
what is the purpose of voiceover? According to Ackerman,

191
00:10:33.741 --> 00:10:35.710
it serves like a portal into the characters.

192
00:10:35.711 --> 00:10:37.970
Psyche making us privy to their inner thoughts,

193
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.620
which would otherwise be inaccessible.

194
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.480
Enter Kotara our narrator from the get-go the movie piggybacks off the TV shows

195
00:10:44.481 --> 00:10:45.020
intro,

196
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.620
which features are 45 seconds efficient narration that ends with powerful,

197
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:50.540
emotional insight into her character.

198
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.600
<v 5>But I believe Ang can save the world.</v>

199
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.760
<v 0>Movie guitarra is a little less economical. Let's look at a sample line.</v>

200
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:03.620
<v 5>The scroll we had was proving to be helpful, almost practicing,</v>

201
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.940
Oh wait, it, it keeps going. We try to stay out of sight,

202
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:12.020
but soca became concerned. We were being followed.

203
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.130
<v 0>Guitarist, voiceover functions, like the Wikipedia plot summary,</v>

204
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.750
like the rest of her duration.

205
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.380
It gives us precisely zero information about her emotional state.

206
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.780
According to Ackerman successful voiceover works.

207
00:11:23.781 --> 00:11:25.100
When it shows us a different person.

208
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.200
<v 3>After that you invent the spending, the abuse,</v>

209
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.960
the fear, the threat of violence.

210
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.290
<v 0>This is the case when a character is being dishonest with the audience or the.</v>

211
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.350
<v 5>Selves basic took great care and reviving him.</v>

212
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.290
<v 0>Look, it's hard as voiceover doesn't elucidate,</v>

213
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:46.040
any internal struggles or reveal anything new about herself or even about her

214
00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:46.874
deep faith. Yeah.

215
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.230
<v 5>Flew us to his home. He told us how he left there in a storm on opera.</v>

216
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.810
<v 0>Here, voiceovers merely piece of duct tape over the torn fabric of the plot.</v>

217
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:56.851
<v 5>Showed them.</v>

218
00:11:56.851 --> 00:12:01.290
He was the last Airbender and was accepted to train with the master.

219
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.350
<v 0>Throughout. We see information conveyed through voiceover. Yeah.</v>

220
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.020
<v 5>My brother and I often go hunting for food,</v>

221
00:12:07.021 --> 00:12:10.620
but unfortunately my brother isn't the best Hunter in the world.

222
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.770
<v 0>Rather than shown through action as it is on the show.</v>

223
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.600
It's not getting away from me this time

224
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.850
In the film, painful information can be conveyed through clinical narration.

225
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.490
<v 5>My mother was taken prisoner and killed. When I was young.</v>

226
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.540
<v 0>On the show, it's organic resulting from a heated confrontation.</v>

227
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.640
<v 3>I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier.</v>

228
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.930
<v 0>It's more good. Voiceover is often compelling because it's motivated.</v>

229
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.070
A given character has a reason for dispensing this piece of information.

230
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.160
The most common way to do this is through the use of a storybook narrator I've

231
00:12:47.161 --> 00:12:49.890
seen in just about every Disney movie, modern audiences,

232
00:12:49.891 --> 00:12:51.960
maybe less compelled by Cinderella's plates,

233
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.290
but the device creatively used certainly can still work.

234
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.740
<v 3>Boy, that's going to happen.</v>

235
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.890
<v 0>But filmmakers have gotten creative with voiceover throughout the years.</v>

236
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.630
For example,

237
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.820
in the classic new are double indemnity voiceover functions as a recorded

238
00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.850
confession to a crime indeed successful noir films,

239
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:15.300
very often employee superb voiceover that adds to the characters,

240
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:19.380
complexity or reveals their subjectivities. Sometimes rendering them unreliable.

241
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.540
<v 3>I saw him once he was dead, he fell out of the car.</v>

242
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.640
<v 0>This makes it tense and dynamic.</v>

243
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.510
The last air benders narration in comparison is flatwood and it just kind of

244
00:13:30.511 --> 00:13:31.344
lazy.

245
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.250
<v 3>Leave the child. Avatar has only knowledge of his birth element air.</v>

246
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.360
<v 0>Let's move on to perhaps the greatest sin in the last Airbender.</v>

247
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.560
The dialogue now dialogue is frequently used as exposition and film,

248
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.760
but what distinguishes good expositional dialogue from bed? According to York,

249
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.050
good exposition is disguised by making it dramatic by injecting conflict,

250
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.960
the greater the conflict, the less visible the exposition.

251
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.320
As an example of successful dialogue, he cites apocalypse now,

252
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.280
which cramps in entire films worth of exposition into one brisk scene.

253
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.990
<v 3>Did you not assassinate a government tax collector country province June 18,</v>

254
00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:07.860
1968.

255
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.600
<v 0>The result as Yorke explains the scene managers to incorporate subtext desire,</v>

256
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.290
conflict,

257
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.400
and the deeply personal to get across almost every fact the film needs in order

258
00:14:17.401 --> 00:14:18.234
to be understood.

259
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.530
The characters evasiveness gives us just as much exposition as the interviewer's

260
00:14:22.531 --> 00:14:25.230
purely informative questions. In contrast,

261
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.560
the last Airbender tends to rely on conflict free exposition.

262
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.650
As when Katara blatantly pumps her grandma for information.

263
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.480
<v 5>What is a spiritual grandma?</v>

264
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.940
<v 0>The result is boring and static.</v>

265
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.240
There are no stakes to the reveal of any piece of information.

266
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.770
<v 3>That little boy might be the avatar.</v>

267
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.480
<v 0>Grandma and Katara.</v>

268
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.380
Both think this kid is the avatar and what's more both in Katara and Saka need

269
00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:52.280
to leave the village to help him Katara to convince socket,

270
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.110
but it's still pretty low conflict.

271
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.920
Contrast this with similarly things encounters on the show were in Kitara and

272
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:00.770
grand grand disagree about whether eggs, the avatars.

273
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.160
<v 2>I told you, he's the real thing. Grand grant.</v>

274
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.350
I finally found a bender to teach me.

275
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.980
FITARA try not to put all your hopes in this boy.

276
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.580
<v 0>These tense moments are expository and that they give background information.</v>

277
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.820
Clearly guitarra has been searching and waiting to find someone to teach her

278
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.490
these moments culminate in guitar,

279
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.340
choosing to go exploring with Ang largely in defiance of her grandma.

280
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.000
Although grand grand eventually gives her blessing all resulting in a compelling

281
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.590
emotional arc and contrast film guitar leaves the village with zero emotional

282
00:15:29.591 --> 00:15:34.420
tension or steaks we're going with let's compare another plot point when Ang

283
00:15:34.421 --> 00:15:38.260
finds out that the air nomads were killed by the fire news in both the movie and

284
00:15:38.261 --> 00:15:41.860
the show guitar tries to warn Ang about what to expect when they get to the

285
00:15:41.861 --> 00:15:45.610
Southern air temple, but on the show after Katara, his worst fears are proven,

286
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.700
right? The air nomads are dead. She starts to tell him.

287
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.840
<v 2>There's something you need to see. Okay,</v>

288
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:03.850
what is it? Uh, just a new water bending move. I learned.

289
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:08.830
<v 0>Guitar tries to hide a painful truth. Ang temple was destroyed by fire vendors.</v>

290
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.250
Meanwhile, anxious, trying to figure out what the F happened to his home.

291
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.970
This setup innately bigs conflict into the reveal of this information.

292
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.330
The helmet becomes a ticking time bomb. And when Ang learns the truth,

293
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.140
we're too wrapped up in the emotions to realize that we are being given crucial

294
00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:25.150
background information. In contrast,

295
00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.600
the truth comes out pretty seamlessly in the film with guitar, eagerly,

296
00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:30.850
volunteering, all the information and needs.

297
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.830
<v 2>The fire nation knew the avatar would be born into the air nomads.</v>

298
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.280
<v 0>But our greatest grievance with last Airbender is the way it deals with Ang</v>

299
00:16:39.281 --> 00:16:40.180
central conflict.

300
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.620
Whether or not he can be slash is ready to be slash even wants to be the avatar

301
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.180
in both the show and the movie.

302
00:16:46.181 --> 00:16:48.670
It takes some time to find out why Ang was in the ice.

303
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.020
That is because he ran away from his duties as the avatar. However, in the film,

304
00:16:53.021 --> 00:16:55.450
this information is revealed quite readily and without.

305
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.180
<v 2>I ran away before they trained me.</v>

306
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.290
<v 0>Confession should be huge. Instead it's accepted by everyone.</v>

307
00:17:02.291 --> 00:17:05.230
Pretty much without reaction in contrast on the show,

308
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.340
Ang tells the truth after prodding from Katara and only to correct her missed

309
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:09.970
assumption.

310
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.990
<v 2>You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that. Well,</v>

311
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.320
that's not exactly what happened. He admitted slowly.

312
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.950
I was afraid confused. I didn't know what to do.

313
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.740
<v 0>What's more, he lets Katara like the audience, put the pieces together, herself,</v>

314
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:31.480
creating a much more dynamic. Those still expository scene. You ran away.

315
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.290
The last Airbender film seems self-conscious about its over-reliance and

316
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:38.590
exposition. And sometimes the script almost tries to repent. For example,

317
00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:42.310
you see the writer trying to create a compelling reason to tell us about Zuko is

318
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.800
banishment first via his rivalry with general shout.

319
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.220
<v 2>No followed is burnished his son, the Prince, and renounced.</v>

320
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.270
<v 3>His love of him and will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the</v>

321
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:55.400
avatar.

322
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.180
<v 0>Line, reveals its own redundancy is ya'll literally says as you know,</v>

323
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.260
rendering the dialogue self-consciously unnecessary. Then the film in parts,

324
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.080
almost the exact same information. Just minutes later,

325
00:18:06.081 --> 00:18:08.930
when Zuko gets a little boy to retell the story of his banishment.

326
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.380
<v 3>Tell me what you know about the Prentice fire.</v>

327
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.120
<v 0>Here. There's no reason why Zuko needs to hear his own life story.</v>

328
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.900
It's lamely justified by the fact that he's trying to explain to his uncle why

329
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.700
he can't party and meet cute girls.

330
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.490
He's been disgraced and must regain his honor. However,

331
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.790
there's no tension to the reveal of his backstory and it mostly amounts to what

332
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.590
Ackerman calls a big vomit pale of information in a remarkably on the nose

333
00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:37.070
moment, near the end of the film, Ang begs the dragon spirit for help.

334
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.160
<v 3>Please tell me how to beat the fire.</v>

335
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.370
The spirit replies who's the ocean.

336
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.240
Show them the power of water.

337
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.290
<v 0>It's a little ironic that the tension between showing and telling comes up in</v>

338
00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:53.000
the literal dialogue of the film.

339
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:57.170
If only the writer had taken the dragon spirits own advice and shown rather than

340
00:18:57.171 --> 00:18:59.810
told us Ang story, but what do you guys think?

341
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.240
Are we being too harsh on a film so bad?

342
00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.040
It's two sequels were promptly abandoned.

343
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.530
