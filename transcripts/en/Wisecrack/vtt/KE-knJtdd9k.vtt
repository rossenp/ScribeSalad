2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.410
Michael here today,

3
00:00:09.411 --> 00:00:13.400
we're talking about the patriarch of everyone's favorite four fingered family,

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.900
master of annoyed, Grun, swaggy schemes, and questionable child-rearing methods.

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.760
The one and only Homer Simpson Homer is the center of the

6
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.910
Simpson's world, providing it with many of its most memorable moments,

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.773
catchiest.

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.580
<v 1>Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Margie.</v>

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.040
I mean that may our T and C.

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.890
<v 0>Just advice about the importance of not trying.</v>

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.880
<v 1>Kids. You tried your best and you failed miserably.</v>

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.180
The lesson is never try.

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.160
<v 0>Some things happened to Homer,</v>

14
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.070
something that turned him from a central figure in pop culture to an

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.200
afterthought for most television viewers.

16
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.150
So how exactly did Homer fall from grace and take the Simpsons down with him?

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.180
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on Homer Simpson,

18
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.530
what went wrong and spoiler alerts for a show that's almost old enough to run

19
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.870
for president. Now, before we dive deeper,

20
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:08.420
I'm going to give a shout out to this week's sponsor surf shark,

21
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:12.560
VPN privacy on the internet may feel non-existent these days,

22
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:16.220
but if VPN may put your mind at ease, it encrypts information.

23
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.770

Now back to the show. Now some background,

38
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.220
the Simpsons first hit the airwaves all the way back in 1989,

39
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.680
modeling itself on the wholesome family sitcom,

40
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.470
which has dominated the small screen over the preceding decade.

41
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.990
It's centered largely around the father slash husband,

42
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:20.600
as he dealt with the trials and tribulations of everyday life.

43
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.450
<v 1>Fit. you fit.</v>

44
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.410
Yeah.

45
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.840
<v 0>Despite being bright yellow cartoon characters,</v>

46
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.680
this Simpson's clan provided a more honest look at the modern American family.

47
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.490
They offered a sharp contrast to the pretty five version of domestic bliss,

48
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.360
which live action sitcoms had been serving up. They may have crazy hair,

49
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.360
but with their bickering, belching and couch centric lifestyle,

50
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.440
this Simpsons were much more like you and me than any other family on TV,

51
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.330
but who was Homer. Anyway,

52
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.270
even when he didn't have his hands around his son's throat,

53
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.650
Homer made for a very different kind of TV dad than his predecessors. You know,

54
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.750
those kindly patriarchs of growing pains or family ties for all patients and

55
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:05.110
fatherly wisdom, short-tempered lazy and kind of dim.

56
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.740
Homer was made more in the angry white male mold of earlier shows.

57
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.370
Think Archie bunker or the honeymooners Ralph Kramden except without the

58
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.520
explicit bigotry or the constant threat of spousal abuse.

59
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.000
His flaws made him more accessible and thus more relatable because he was

60
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.110
basically just a regular guy who found himself constantly overwhelmed by.

61
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.600
<v 2>Do OCO and solutions.</v>

62
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.540
<v 1>To all of life's problems.</v>

63
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.810
<v 0>Despite his shortcomings, he had managed to clot together the life,</v>

64
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:38.190
which TV had been teaching all Americans to aspire to since the fifties, a wife,

65
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.880
two and a half kids, a house in the suburbs and two cars in the driveway,

66
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.000
but he was barely able to hold it together. Each day,

67
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:48.630
saw him dragging himself into a job. He hated to pay off a mortgage.

68
00:03:48.631 --> 00:03:51.540
He couldn't afford before coming home to the family whose problems.

69
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:55.620
He didn't really understand all while he would rather just sit on the couch or

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.130
go out for a few beers. This was in keeping with the ethos of the show,

71
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.550
which offered a more skeptical vision of the world than the wholesome likes of

72
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:04.230
family ties or leave it to Beaver.

73
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.100
It's a world where most people are prone to selfishness and outright stupidity.

74
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.810
<v 2>But we're very, very busy down here. Hey, take me.</v>

75
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.100
<v 0>Daily. Life is full of minor. Indignations that cause major outbreaks.</v>

76
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.080
<v 1>If we it'll make you feel any better,</v>

77
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.860
I've learned that life is one crushing defeat. After another,

78
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:25.350
until you just wished Flanders was dead.

79
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.070
<v 0>And while Homer may be sympathetic, the writers don't let them off the hook,</v>

80
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.850
making it clear that he's responsible for a lot of his own problems.

81
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.910
Tick is perpetual rivalry with his neighbor, Ned Flanders,

82
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.140
a man who bends over backwards to be nice to Homer only to receive a tirade of

83
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:43.350
abusive petty vengeance and unreturned belongings in Rome.

84
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.690
<v 1>Past instances in which I prefer to like you were fraudulent.</v>

85
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.000
Oh, well, I'll just have to try harder.

86
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.070
<v 2>Thanks for grabbing back.</v>

87
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.850
<v 0>We get why Ned bothers Homer so much. He makes living a happy,</v>

88
00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:59.610
healthy life appear so easy. Hi, diddly.

89
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.303
<v 1>Flanders.</v>

90
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.670
<v 0>But Homer's resentment. Doesn't justify being a jerk.</v>

91
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.920
So his schemes almost always blow up.

92
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.250
Take that time before it's Ned to go through with a bet which we'll see them

93
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.440
both mowing the lawn and their wife's Sunday,

94
00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:18.030
finest only to net is completely unembarrassed while Homer is mortified.

95
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.390
But that doesn't mean Homer wasn't capable of many redemptions.

96
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.690
When he actually does succeed in seriously upsetting Flanders.

97
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.450
He feels bad about it and tries to put things right,

98
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.850
like his last minute effort to rescue the left. Tori.

99
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.640
<v 2>Hallmark affordable track housing made us neighbors, but you made us friends.</v>

100
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.270
<v 0>Point is in the earlier seasons. Homer's bad behavior.</v>

101
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.280
Basically always catches up with them.

102
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.380
<v 2>Hi Halima. I brought you.</v>

103
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.220
<v 0>He gets super mad about something and refuses to back down or become so bored</v>

104
00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:55.980
with his daily life that he goes on some ill fated adventure.

105
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.350
He might destroy the town to avoid taking out the trash or gained 61 pounds to

106
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:03.080
avoid work or randomly switch careers on a Lark.

107
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.100
<v 1>That's it. You people have stood in my way long enough.</v>

108
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.110
I'm going to cone college.

109
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.670
<v 0>The consequences are most serious. One Homer's selfishness hurts his own family.</v>

110
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.320
We have some great plans.

111
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.860
<v 1>Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans to spend it on beer.</v>

112
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.570
<v 0>Is although he might be a slobbish partner and emotionally unavailable father</v>

113
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.210
Homer really does love his wife and children.

114
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.160
So how do the early Simpson seasons reconcile Homer's buffoonery with his real

115
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:35.560
emotional stakes by being genuine,

116
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.280
many of the Simpsons sweetest moments come when a Homer realizes he's messed up

117
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.230
and then tries his best to fix it.

118
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.840
Like the classic scene at the end of Lisa's substitute.

119
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:45.430
When Homer goes from room to room,

120
00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:48.280
listening to his family's problems and trying to cheer them up,

121
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.030
his chat with leads has become especially beloved because of the way Homer owns

122
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:55.750
up to all of his shortcomings and admits how lucky he is to have his family.

123
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.530
It's a perfect demonstration of the softer sweeter side of Homer,

124
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.350
which balances out his angrier more of-ish behavior.

125
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.310
<v 1>Maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your dollhouse for you.</v>

126
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.211
<v 0>Well,</v>

127
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:11.200
Homer might represent a more cynical take on what an every man really looks

128
00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:15.430
like. He was never just the butt of the joke. The show is insane. Wow.

129
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.950
Look how lazy and ridiculous everybody is.

130
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.170
But something more like we're all kind of goofy,

131
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:23.920
but we might be okay if we look out for each other, how's your marriage.

132
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.140
<v 1>Jamie's usual. Perfect. Imundo.</v>

133
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.800
<v 0>This Simpsons had a lot of fun highlighting the various, a packer season,</v>

134
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:33.910
inadequacies of modern day America and how far it all felt from the idealized

135
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:36.310
vision of the classic sitcoms, but it always did.

136
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:38.440
So from a place of genuine warmth,

137
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.660
it always came back to the decency beneath the.

138
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.000
<v 1>There are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up.</v>

139
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.610
<v 0>Showing on the quality gradually began to drop off.</v>

140
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.060
And fans had pointed to any number of culprits, some blame,

141
00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:01.660
certain showrunners for misunderstanding the series while others believe it was

142
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:04.990
more of a too many cooks scenario. As the writing staff expanded,

143
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.370
whatever the reason something had happened to the show and specifically to

144
00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:13.030
Homer, the issue isn't that he became dumber or wackier though.

145
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.890
He did it's that he became more.

146
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.560
<v 1>Yeah. Grandfather is super lame. I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father,</v>

147
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.270
what's my excuse for this.

148
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.720
<v 0>Anytime, a sit-com runs for season after season,</v>

149
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.650
the characters gradually become more exaggerated versions of themselves.

150
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.570
Fraiser crane goes from pretentious,

151
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.470
suave socialite to pompous buffoon on friends, Joey Tribbiani.

152
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.140
He goes from slightly vapid, pretty boy to a zoo Lander.

153
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.930
So parody of himself and community's Brita Perry.

154
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:47.530
It goes from impassion student activists to simply the worst.

155
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.430
You seem smarter than me. When I met you,

156
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.950
we see the same thing happened to Homer. He becomes a caricature of himself,

157
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.800
both visually and emotionally.

158
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.840
His IQ dwindles has temper short and he goes from a put upon schmuck to an

159
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.280
all out before noon,

160
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.660
getting himself into increasingly outrageous scrapes and the show matched

161
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.740
Homer's gradual drift towards absurdity, focusing less on a real life.

162
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:14.940
Domestic troubles in favor of zany or plot lines and globe trotting adventures.

163
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.120
This wasn't necessarily a deal breaker for a long time.

164
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.420
A Homer retained enough self-awareness to make this new iteration of the

165
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:22.440
character work.

166
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.950
<v 1>You mean? I think this is crazy, but eventually.</v>

167
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.680
<v 0>Homer's worst tendencies began to take over.</v>

168
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.920
Remember how Homer used to make amends after hurting his family.

169
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.230
Compare that to this slightly later example,

170
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.350
when he's caught on camera bemoaning his familial burdens.

171
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.850
<v 1>Marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail. Once again.</v>

172
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.670
<v 0>And Homer has acted callously towards his loved ones,</v>

173
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.930
but this time he shows no remorse and is rewarded for his deliciousness with a

174
00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:52.100
trip to rock camp.

175
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.180
The viewer is no longer being asked to care about how crappily he's treated his

176
00:09:56.181 --> 00:10:00.740
family, his selfish claim that they ruined his life basically goes unchallenged.

177
00:10:00.741 --> 00:10:05.510
And the episode moves on this incident is typical of the new Homer known to fans

178
00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:08.270
as jerk Homer, and they're not wrong.

179
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.800
He becomes increasingly obnoxious destructive and just plain mean-spirited.

180
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:13.850
At the same time,

181
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:17.930
the show seems increasingly less interested in having him face any consequences

182
00:10:17.931 --> 00:10:21.410
for his behavior. Later episodes revolve around Homer pulling crap,

183
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:24.800
like pretending to kill principal Skinner's mother scamming the town with the

184
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:29.600
fake parking meter and even wiping out Springfield with an EMP in season one,

185
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.400
Homer was so devastated by his own failures that he almost killed himself for

186
00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:36.620
all his flaws and goofball antics.

187
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.340
The show made certain that his actions and choices mattered jerk.

188
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.860
Homer is more of an all-purpose rodeo clown,

189
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.570
ready to do whatever outrageous thing might raise a laugh up to and including

190
00:10:47.571 --> 00:10:49.670
framing Marge for a DUI.

191
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.020
Clearly the show has significantly changed the way it views its leading man and

192
00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:56.990
how it wants to use him as Homer moves from hapless,

193
00:10:56.991 --> 00:10:59.510
but kindhearted OEF to rampaging bully.

194
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.500
The Simpson starts playing for a notably different sort of labs rather than

195
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:07.070
depicting the flaws and foibles of everyday life with both skepticism and

196
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.020
optimism like in its early days,

197
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.990
the show descends into a detached kind of cynicism.

198
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.190
<v 1>You'll be so kind as just dart my car for me. I'm going to Moe's.</v>

199
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.850
Woo. So how did this happen.

200
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.800
<v 0>To make sense of Homer's transformation?</v>

201
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:28.160
It helps to look at the broader cultural landscape and how it's changed over the

202
00:11:28.161 --> 00:11:30.920
course of the Simpson's run. When the show first arrived,

203
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.450
it was a real trailblazer,

204
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.780
not just because it was a prime time adult animated series,

205
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.380
but because it provided a much rougher around the edges picture of family life

206
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:41.450
than we'd seen before. And in the process,

207
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:45.230
it ushered in a new generation of adult animation that took things a step

208
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.170
further, you know, shows like South park and family guy,

209
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.490
which traded a shock and all style of comedy where the absolute lack of empathy

210
00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:53.740
is largely the point.

211
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.280
<v 2>Hey, Kevin, give me, give me mic.</v>

212
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.500
She's writing it right there.

213
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.610
<v 0>While these shows had sent a mental moments,</v>

214
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.830
their comedy was mostly pretty cynical,

215
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.090
disavowing everyone in everything in favor of the next punchline to enjoy them a

216
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.880
level and antics of Eric Cartman and early Stewie Griffin.

217
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.670
You had to treat their world as total sandboxes,

218
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.250
not places with real emotional stakes.

219
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.690
This opened up all kinds of new comedic avenues while basically precluding any

220
00:12:21.691 --> 00:12:23.100
potential for sincerity.

221
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.940
<v 2>Help me. I'll be one can now be here. My only hope. All right, now,</v>

222
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.890
why do I click click preferences?

223
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.031
<v 0>Fundamentally,</v>

224
00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:34.410
this humor relies on you not really caring about the characters too much. Do.

225
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.660
<v 2>My actions have consequences.</v>

226
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.660
<v 0>Whether it was intentionally aping rival shows or not,</v>

227
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.220
the Simpsons has gradually followed this path by turning Homer into a much more

228
00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:45.360
cynical character.

229
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.260
All his earthly attachments are pretty much gone gross out jokes about

230
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:52.170
bedwetting or outrageous gags about demonic threesomes.

231
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.060
<v 2>Three way. You me and merge even demon. You.</v>

232
00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.760
<v 0>Are now par for the course.</v>

233
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.810
It's like the writers are hoping that the sheer absurdity or edginess of what

234
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:06.090
he's doing will be enough to get a laugh.

235
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.590
This new iteration of the Simpsons keeps everything at a kind of ironic distance

236
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:15.090
telling the audience to emotionally disengage so it can crack another edgy joke.

237
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.560
But this all comes at the cost of the sweet moving moments we got from classic

238
00:13:19.561 --> 00:13:23.310
Homer. He still has his trademark annoyed grunt and love of Duff beer.

239
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.790
But beyond that, there's not really much of the old Homer left.

240
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.450
We're not saying that sitcoms like the Simpsons need to be preachy or to end

241
00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:33.180
every episode within. I learned something today, speech,

242
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.810
but there is a real cost to removing the emotional anchors from their character.

243
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.560
While Homer might now be able to go toe to toe with Peter Griffin in a brutal

244
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.730
fistfight, it's harder to care about it because it's harder to care about him.

245
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.790
If there is a lesson to be learned from Homer's fall from grace,

246
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.270
it might be that selling your character soul for easier quicker.

247
00:13:51.271 --> 00:13:54.810
Gags is a pathway of diminishing returns. Of course,

248
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.100
some reason cartoons are remarkable for the refusal to descend into full blown

249
00:13:59.101 --> 00:14:02.820
cynicism. While BoJack horseman is dark, even nihilistic,

250
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.610
the characters are earnestly trying to become better.

251
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.100
And then there's Bob's burgers, which keeps the belt.

252
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.650
Her family's love for each other front and center,

253
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.780
no matter how crazy things get.

254
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.010
But what do you think wisecrack is adult animation best when drowned and booze

255
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:20.970
and cynicism, or do you miss the good natured buffoonery of classic Homer?
