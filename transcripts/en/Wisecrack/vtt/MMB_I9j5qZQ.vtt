00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.250
<v 0>This video is brought to you by keeps.</v>

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.820
<v 1>What's up. Wisecrack Michael here. I don't know if you knew this,</v>

3
00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:14.810
but a lot of people are having totally level-headed reasoned debates about

4
00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:15.890
censorship these days.

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.430
<v 2>We are,</v>

6
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.380
we are living under Linda living for that effect under communist regime.

7
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.620
Right now we're living under a Nazi regime, a communist regime,

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.730
a fascist regime.

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.540
<v 1>Just kidding. YouTube removes videos for spreading medical misinformation,</v>

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.940
tic TAC, shadow ban certain political content.

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.290
University professors are losing their jobs. And it seems like every week,

12
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.860
Facebook and Reddit are banning entire communities that violate their terms of

13
00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:40.520
service.

14
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.780
As for the government civil rights lawyers accused the us military of violating

15
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:48.410
the first amendment for banning users on their Twitch streams who asked them

16
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:51.350
about war crimes. And then, you know, there's this.

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

18
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.640
<v 1>A lot of it raises a central question. What is censorship?</v>

19
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.530
Am I being unjustly censored?

20
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.130
When I get thrown out of my local taco bell after smearing myself and mashed

21
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.830
potatoes to protest their anti Spud menu changes.

22
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.950
What about if I do it at city hall more seriously,

23
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.790
we might ask about what it means when private entities who have always had a

24
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:17.360
right to refuse people service for many, but not all reasons.

25
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.560
Get the fact check a public figure or black people from sharing a news article

26
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:25.640
about this son of a presidential candidate Americans like to celebrate our long

27
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:27.860
history free expression. And as a result,

28
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.640
we really hate when something looks or even just feels like censorship,

29
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.320
but it turns out the way we think about censorship is often wrong and usually

30
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.310
inadequate for thinking about what it looks like today to figure out what is

31
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.850
happening. Let's go back to the beginning in this wisecrack addition on,

32
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.260
and before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to keeps.

33
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.870
It can be really embarrassing to talk about getting older.

34
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.970
It seems like your back is always out of lack.

35
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.480
You don't recognize all the memes on Twitter and some people might find

36
00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:58.610
themselves losing their hair. In fact,

37
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.760
two out of three guys will experience some form of male pattern baldness by the

38
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:06.170
time they're 35, unfortunately you can't just urban dictionary away.

39
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:07.610
The solution to losing your hair.

40
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.080
However you can turn to keeps keeps is an affordable hair loss treatment program

41
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:15.080
that provides FDA approved prescription and over-the-counter medication.

42
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.140
You used to have to go to the doctor's office for hair loss prescription,

43
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:21.740
but thanks to keeps you can visit a doctor online and get the medication

44
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.270

They make it easy and deliver your medication every three months.

Keeps treatments can take four to six months or more to see results.

48
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.780
So the sooner you act, the more hair you can save,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.410
find out why keeps has more five-star reviews than any of its competitors.

50
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:43.040

53
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.160
it'd be hugely disappointing to our philosophically inclined fans.

54
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:56.900
If I didn't mention one of ancient histories,

55
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.340
most notable victims of censorship and 99 BC,

56
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.150
a 70 year old man in Athens was sentenced to death on two charges,

57
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.880
corrupting the youth and worshiping false gods.

58
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.900
The man was Socrates and he was critical of the young democratic government of

59
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.450
Athens, which was at war with its neighbors. Sparta.

60
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.540
Two of his students were involved in violent rebellions against Athens.

61
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.050
While the students died, Socrates was still around to blame.

62
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.280
The Athenians were worried.

63
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:24.490
He'd poisoned more young minds with his anti-democratic ideas.

64
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.490
So he was put on trial and sentenced to drink hemlock.

65
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.190
When your 10th grade history teacher brought up Socrates,

66
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.590
it was probably to show how far we've come from.

67
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.270
This kind of censorship poisoning,

68
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.570
an old guy for saying stuff is wrong today in America,

69
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.900
we don't punish people for bad mouthing the government that's protected by the

70
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:45.700
first amendment. We can even burn our flag, except well, that was a lie.

71
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.930
And not for the reasons you think basically for as long as the first amendment

72
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:54.100
has existed. America has been incredibly eager to bypass it. Indeed.

73
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.950
Our so-called inalienable, right?

74
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.241
<v 3>Because like,</v>

75
00:03:57.241 --> 00:04:01.080
if there were a book with covers made it you'd think that's intriguing.

76
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:04.440
I wonder what's in this book that they saw fit to give it covers made of pure.

77
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.720
And then you open it and.

78
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.600
<v 1>All being decided in the Supreme court as late as the 1970s.</v>

79
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.920
But what is censorship? Anyway, broadly speaking is the suppression of words,

80
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.720
images or ideas that are offensive, harmful, or otherwise objectionable to well,

81
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.600
whoever the sensor happens to be in the case of Socrates,

82
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.630
the governments of Athens censored him because they believed he was a threat to

83
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:32.070
their democracy and its most obvious form the sensors or the people in power

84
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.950
openly trying to stop certain ideas from reaching the public.

85
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.790
And that might mean creating laws that let you poison old guys or banning and

86
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:40.650
burning books, outlawing religions.

87
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.410
<v 3>Nobody expects the.</v>

88
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.830
<v 1>Spanish inquisition or even straight up controlling the press.</v>

89
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.950
It's the kind of censorship America's founders feared when they created the

90
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:54.000
first amendment prohibiting the government specifically from limiting speech or

91
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:57.690
establishing a state religion, sociologists Sue Curry, Janssen calls,

92
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:02.580
such limitations, regulative censorship, regulative. Censorship is hella old.

93
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.290
Like when Egyptian Pharaoh are not incent Royal officials to physically chisel

94
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:10.200
away any references to gods on tombs, temples,

95
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.580
and walls that weren't his preferred God and Chinese emperor chin show Wong

96
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.970
ordered the destruction of books so that people would believe the world began

97
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:20.130
with his reign centuries. Later in Europe,

98
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.280
the Catholic church published its first index of forbidden books.

99
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.260
And then there was the Spanish inquisition,

100
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.520
which not only prohibited certain books, but expelled Jews from Spain's borders,

101
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.610
torturing and killing thousands of people in the process.

102
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.050
This is the kind of censorship,

103
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.590
our history books love to talk about which isn't a bad thing.

104
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.320
It's just not the only thing over time.

105
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:43.350
The kinds of things that got censored and the way they got censored started to

106
00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:46.890
change with censorship came more opposition to censorship.

107
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.460
More people started defending freedom of expression and freedom of the press

108
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.180
globally.

109
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.930
And those ideas became particularly popular in Europe and its colonies.

110
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.000
Sweden became the first country to formally censorship of the law guaranteeing

111
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:03.140
freedom of the press in 1766, after it finally became a country,

112
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.040
America cemented the freedom of the press and expression in its very first

113
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.390
constitutional amendment. Hell you censorship. Oh, um,

114
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.840
fudge censorship just seven years later,

115
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.760
founding father bill of rights champion.

116
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.450
And America's second president John Adams signed first of the sedition acts,

117
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:25.190
which, uh, would drag you to court for criticizing the government. Oh boy,

118
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.300
just like the ancient Athenians feared Socrates Adams and his fellow Federalists

119
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:31.700
were concerned that their political opponents were going to spread

120
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.960
anti-government ideas. As a result of 25, people were arrested,

121
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.320
mostly editors of newspapers who criticized the Adams administration.

122
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.580
One guy was arrested for referring to the press as the blind bald crippled,

123
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.230
toothless querulous Adams.

124
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.470
The clear abuse of the law caused protests across the country.

125
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.650
And it was repealed a few years later under Jefferson's presidency,

126
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.130
but there would be much more successful attempts at censorship by the

127
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:59.810
government. So we see this open push for censorship and the ensuing backlash,

128
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:03.800
which on does it. So if you're looking to label some ideas as unspeakable,

129
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.540
what do you do? You roll out licenses or classic Dettori bodies,

130
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.470
for example, it's not that you can't say whatever you want on a TV station,

131
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.080
but you do need a license to run a TV station.

132
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.943
<v 4>Janet.</v>

133
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.800
<v 1>And well to maintain that license,</v>

134
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:26.260
you need to follow the rules laid out by the FCC,

135
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.420
which means not saying certain words.

136
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.780
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.020
<v 1>Without getting a hefty fine on the classification front,</v>

138
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.410
you can make whatever movie you want, but if it has too many bad words,

139
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:42.940
the NPA will give it an R rating and movie theaters. Won't let the kids see it.

140
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.150
Sue Curry Jansen describes this method as the good lie,

141
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.200
which serves to hide the operations of the sensor more often than not people who

142
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:53.050
aren't specifically persecuted by the censoring bodies,

143
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:57.370
hop on the bandwagon and accept these new forms of censorship because such rules

144
00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:58.630
fit with their worldview.

145
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.170
The licensing kind of censorship is how Woodrow Wilson pulled off.

146
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:06.280
One of the most far reaching censorship drives in American history during world

147
00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:09.250
war one, he formed the committee on public information,

148
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.970
both a creator of propaganda and a licensing authority.

149
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.990
It manipulated and censored all external news coverage about the war on a scale,

150
00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:21.610
never seen before in the U S eventually they had control over every part of the

151
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:22.180
media.

152
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.540
They reviewed every newspaper and every radio program to make sure it didn't

153
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.040
impede the war effort. But instead of the framing of everything is banned.

154
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.540
The framing was the nice authorities are going to look everything over and

155
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.350
approve it. First, the good lie,

156
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.190
150,000 Americans emboldened to bolster the war effort,

157
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.560
signed up to volunteer for the CPI.

158
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.510
They did that stuff for free Wilson also passed the 1918 sedition act,

159
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.290
making it punishable by 20 years in jail to utter print,

160
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.380
write or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous,

161
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:57.120
or abusive language about the form of the government of the United States.

162
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.690
Basically a series of laws ensured that if you printed anything,

163
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.420
the CPI didn't approve of you were in big trouble.

164
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.780
A guy named Charles Schenck was sentenced to six months in prison for

165
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:07.950
distributing a leaflet,

166
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:12.390
opposing the draft with the headline long live the constitution of the United

167
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.970
States like Socrates teaching, it was dangerous.

168
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.550
It might jeopardize America's national security.

169
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.080
Now you might've heard the phrase shouting fire in a crowded theater to describe

170
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.700
reasonable limits on free speech.

171
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.050
If I create a fake panic during a play where people get trampled to death,

172
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.680
no one would say that's within your constitutionally protected rights.

173
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.410
It's censorship in a way, but he censorship.

174
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.360
Most reasonable people would support.

175
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.630
But the common sense of the phrase is hugely deceptive.

176
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.440
It became a go-to example of acceptable censorship after it was lifted from the

177
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:48.260
text, the Supreme court decision for one Mr. Shank and his antidromic leaflets.

178
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.510
But despite the obviousness of his logic,

179
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.810
it was meant as a metaphor for why shank must be censored.

180
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.150
The court unanimously upheld his conviction,

181
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.950
criticizing America's involvement in a war was now akin to making a false panic

182
00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:05.150
at the theater Wilson contended that censorship was absolutely necessary to

183
00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:09.380
public safety and like the Supreme court people bought it. Ironically,

184
00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:13.400
it was Wilson censorship drive that suppressed news of a dangerous new form of

185
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:16.580
influenza that was decimating American military basis.

186
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.820
While this censorship was meant to bolster morale for the war effort,

187
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.750
nearly half of troop fatalities were a result of the censor disease.

188
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.140
It was this censorship which led to the name, the Spanish flu,

189
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.740
since Spain's press freely reported on this for boating topic.

190
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.890
And this wasn't some weird aberration in American history,

191
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.510
four time presidential candidate,

192
00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:39.860
Eugene Debs was also thrown in jail for criticizing the war and the shank case

193
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:44.120
wasn't overturned until 1969. As late as 1971,

194
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:46.760
the Supreme court had to decide if wearing a buck,

195
00:10:46.761 --> 00:10:49.490
the draft jacket in a courthouse was protected speech.

196
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.010
While this might seem like bill of rights, one Oh one,

197
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.340
it was up for debate among the nation's foremost legal authorities.

198
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.270
If the naughty word and the phrase was worthy of constitutional protection,

199
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:04.370
a protection, the court affirmed in a five, four decision. Thank God, Hey,

200
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.800
no bleeps because it's history kids,

201
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.100
but not all censorship comes from written laws or court decisions.

202
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.660
A lot of it comes from us often on a wedding as the result of government

203
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:18.410
interference. According to Jansen, this is constituent of censorship.

204
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.430
Other scholars call it sociological censorship or existential centers. Sure.

205
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.420
But it's basically the set of unwritten rules and norms that shape and limit the

206
00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:27.680
ideas people have,

207
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.600
the censorship that system allow tolerate or even ask for under Wilson,

208
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.240
many papers, actively censored influenza news,

209
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.430
just to do their part in the war effort,

210
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.470
censoring bad things about the war effort just became a norm held by people even

211
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.630
with out the threat of fines or imprisonment and its effects continue.

212
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.940
And you'd long after the war was over.

213
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.720
Constituent of censorship happens without government's interference too.

214
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.060
For instance, I might not want to show at the house of former wisecrack CEO,

215
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.640
Jacob Solomon, to leave him a note that says,

216
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.590
I am the lizard King for fear of personal or professional repercussions and

217
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.030
served.

218
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.900
They have 300 journalists by the Columbia journalism review about one quarter

219
00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:10.770
responded that they purposely avoided newsworthy stories, citing reasons,

220
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:14.430
ranging from fear of embarrassment or potential career damage to protect in

221
00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:15.180
business interests.

222
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.750
People also center themselves with deference to the sensibilities of others.

223
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:22.440
Like not saying curse words around your not screaming,

224
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.430
vaccines are safe and effective in a whole foods. Parking lot,

225
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.300
all the pointing fingers about people feeling censored at work places or

226
00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:32.490
universities. This is often what's happening.

227
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.630
Groups of people hold certain values and running a foul of those values could

228
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:40.500
lead to a range of reactions from I respect you less to,

229
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.860
I'm going to openly criticize you with my peers for deviating too.

230
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.220
I'm going to try to get you fired in our history of censorship.

231
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.140
Janssen writes that constituent of censorships are elastic limits or permission

232
00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:53.820
can be expanded or contracted,

233
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.180
but constituent censorships can never be fully eliminated.

234
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.650
What she means is the rules and norms that define what society finds acceptable

235
00:13:01.651 --> 00:13:03.570
are flexible and can change.

236
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.660
Sometimes the government can influence them and sometimes the public can

237
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.030
influence them, but they're always there.

238
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.020
People often scream censorship about things that are kind of inevitable due to

239
00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:13.620
this,

240
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.830
the same people who think they're being censored out of fear of their peers will

241
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:19.710
say mean things about them might very well be the same people,

242
00:13:19.711 --> 00:13:23.700
making a 40 minute rage filled response video for the crime of suggesting the

243
00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:27.210
last Jedi wasn't that bad with no sense of irony.

244
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.200
What they might really be complaining about though is the Overton window.

245
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.340
You can imagine the Overton window as a range that slides up and down on an

246
00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:39.300
ideological spectrum within the window are a range of ideas that seem diverse

247
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.740
summer popular insensible to one side of the spectrum and the others are popular

248
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.900
and sensible to those on the other side of the spectrum.

249
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:51.000
But out of view are ideas that are radical even unthinkable until

250
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:51.834
they aren't.

251
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.260
According to the free market advocate think tank guy who coined the term,

252
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.960
Joseph Lehman, the window shifts and moves.

253
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.610
What was once unthinkable like say an interracial kiss on television in the

254
00:14:02.611 --> 00:14:07.380
1960s might become radical than acceptable and eventually even

255
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:11.940
commonplace the window of both moves and widens through exposure to new ideas.

256
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.450
Because if you force people to consider an unthinkable idea,

257
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.740
even if they don't like it all the less extreme ideas suddenly seem possible,

258
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.450
maybe even acceptable.

259
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.990
But remember there are always things outside the window,

260
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.300
things that beyond public tolerance,

261
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.740
when people are you about cancel culture and censorship and response to public

262
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.870
figures, receiving a torrent of criticism,

263
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.260
it's often really a complaint about where the Overton window is.

264
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.620
Even for the loudest people, shouting free speech on the internet.

265
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.660
They probably draw the line like most people at say endorsing pedophilia

266
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.070
and oftentimes people as a group expressing their feelings that such and such

267
00:14:50.071 --> 00:14:52.820
person has bad ideas does dumb is itself.

268
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.950
Just people expressing their own opinions.

269
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.110
Should we censor those people from criticizing.

270
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.420
<v 5>Know there's this video?</v>

271
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.300
It gives me this video gives me hope and certain moments where I'm like,

272
00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:04.360
this is actually a pretty good video. And then it gives me brain cancer.

273
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:05.890
At the same time, probably not.

274
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.270
<v 1>The point is cries of censorship directed at one side are often a smoke screen</v>

275
00:15:10.271 --> 00:15:13.360
for saying my constituent of censorship is normal and fine.

276
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.340
Yours is not case in points.

277
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:19.510
University professors getting fired for their ideas while the narrative is that

278
00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:22.330
the censorious left is getting anyone fired,

279
00:15:22.331 --> 00:15:24.340
who doesn't fall in line with their ideas.

280
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.940
Independent reviews actually show that while yes, this does happen.

281
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.660
It happens in far greater numbers to left-leaning professors at the hands of

282
00:15:31.661 --> 00:15:34.540
conservative backlash. But back to the Overton window,

283
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.800
there's a bit of confusion over how it moves a lot of popular thinking,

284
00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:42.820
claims that it's all on corrupt lawmakers who use their power to intentionally

285
00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:44.620
shift the window to the extreme,

286
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.120
whether it's to be inflammatory or make one's fringe ideas more acceptable and

287
00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:52.090
promote their own aims in a Politico interview.

288
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.520
Lehman are used that this is a misconception.

289
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.820
While you can push the window by advocating for radical ideas.

290
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.880
He says it actually happens through public discourse. He says,

291
00:16:00.881 --> 00:16:04.960
this idea that lawmakers are trying to shift the window is absolutely false.

292
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.560
Lawmakers are actually in the business of detecting where the window is and then

293
00:16:08.561 --> 00:16:10.240
moving to be in accordance with it.

294
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.410
Others like Noam Chomsky argue that some lawmakers have an interest in keeping

295
00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:15.970
the Overton window where it is,

296
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.780
and that they'll do a whole lot to make sure people are ignorant of what's

297
00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:24.010
outside of it. In 1998, before the Overton window was a mainstream idea,

298
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.000
Chomsky argued the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly

299
00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:29.920
limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion,

300
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.060
but allow very lively debate within that spectrum even encouraged the more

301
00:16:34.061 --> 00:16:37.420
critical and dissident views that gives people the sense that there's free

302
00:16:37.421 --> 00:16:41.200
thinking, going through a lot of channels, but especially the media.

303
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.250
We hear a lot about what kind of ideas are radical or crazy that runs through in

304
00:16:45.251 --> 00:16:47.140
elaborate filter of corporate interests.

305
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.440
Others have called this kind of censorship markets, censorship,

306
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.530
basically that while we're giving the illusion of choice,

307
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.130
the people who run the news organizations, publishers, and so on,

308
00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.350
get to decide what is allowed.

309
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.250
So while people might be upset when Spotify employees are trying to fire Joe

310
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.500
Rogan, it's the same kind of editorial.

311
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.230
Decision-making the company employees every day,

312
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.980
like when they decide to reject my pitch for the bring back potatoes and taco

313
00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:14.860
bell podcast, or the Spotify should pay musicians,

314
00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:16.870
more podcast brought to you by Spotify.

315
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.410
It's not that these decisions don't have the effect of shutting out ideas,

316
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.700
but it happens on a daily basis that people are otherwise fine with every time a

317
00:17:24.701 --> 00:17:26.740
museum ops to show one artist, instead of another,

318
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.930
every time someone does or doesn't get a book deal.

319
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.230
Every time a news anchors contract is renewed or not.

320
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.890
I'm not saying this kind of market censorship is good, but in less,

321
00:17:35.891 --> 00:17:40.150
the argument is Spotify should pay everyone with an idea with no regard to the

322
00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:43.840
content of that idea. Our concept of censorship is a little lacking here.

323
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.150
Otherwise it seems like people are saying,

324
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.150
my idea should get past this filter others should.

325
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.840
And while well-reasoned people generally concerned about the way misinformation

326
00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:55.880
spreads on social media like wildfire,

327
00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.520
we might not want to be so enthusiastic about Twitter,

328
00:17:58.521 --> 00:18:02.780
removing articles about Hunter Biden while coordinated disinformation might be a

329
00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:06.050
huge threat to the very idea of free and open discourse.

330
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.650
It doesn't take a lot of that connecting to see how our methods for fighting

331
00:18:09.651 --> 00:18:11.390
those things can end up haunting us.

332
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.470
It might just end up seeding power to people in Capitol Hill or Silicon Valley

333
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.720
to decide what ideas are too dangerous.

334
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.410
It's the same rationale that got shanked thrown in jail under Wilson and the

335
00:18:21.411 --> 00:18:25.370
blacklisted actors for their political affiliations during the McCarthy era and

336
00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:26.570
the 1940s and fifties,

337
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.560
the federal government thought they had a solution to a similar problem.

338
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:35.420
The FCC mandated that TV and radio stations give airtime to both sides of any

339
00:18:35.421 --> 00:18:39.080
controversial issue. It was called the fairness doctrine,

340
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.710
but something happened in the early 1960s. John F.

341
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.100
Kennedy figured out he could gain the doctrine by appointing political allies to

342
00:18:46.101 --> 00:18:50.330
the FCC, and then lean on them to find ways to manipulate news coverage.

343
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.110
He told his buddies to rigorously enforce the fairness doctrine and they

344
00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:58.730
enforced it to be fair to Kennedy by using their FCC powers to call it any

345
00:18:58.731 --> 00:19:00.740
unbalanced criticisms of him,

346
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.430
Nixon would later do the same thing using the fairness doctrine to pressure TV

347
00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:08.150
networks, to give more fair and balanced coverage of the Vietnam war.

348
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.380
What he really meant was more flattering coverage and censorship of the Ward's

349
00:19:12.381 --> 00:19:16.700
atrocities. Okay. But what does all of this have to do with big daddy,

350
00:19:16.701 --> 00:19:20.300
Twitter hiding tweets and YouTube demonetizing videos? Well,

351
00:19:20.301 --> 00:19:25.070
a lot of people are worried that the same thing that JFK did to the TV networks

352
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.720
could happen with the internet.

353
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.510
If the FCC is in the pocket of whoever's in charge,

354
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.360
they might abuse their power and influence the media.

355
00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:37.130
We consume attempting to worst internet platforms into widely skewing content

356
00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:40.370
moderation, to what governments want seems maybe bad.

357
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.140
And also just like another kind of censorship ironically pushes by conservative

358
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.570
politicians to be fair to right-wing news.

359
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.440
Let's ended up with Facebook systematically favoring right-wing news while

360
00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:52.970
suppressing left-wing news,

361
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.750
Facebook as to the central problem with a lot of censorship discourse.

362
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.750
So much of the history of censorship relates to the government and the

363
00:19:59.751 --> 00:20:01.880
distribution of the press and public spaces.

364
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.440
Problem is public space has virtually disappeared in the last century in lieu of

365
00:20:06.441 --> 00:20:08.180
public squares and meeting places.

366
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:11.300
We have shopping malls and privately owned internet companies.

367
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:16.280
And like the taco bell that threw me private companies are in no way obligated

368
00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:19.610
to honor free speech laws. But fact is the same.

369
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.390
It's just that instead of the government regulating speech companies do

370
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.600
censorship today happen in a myriad of ways,

371
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.170
but our narrow focus can often obscure the greater systems at play.

372
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.930
It's easy to get mad when a professor loses their job,

373
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.310
it's harder to look at everyone who never got a job offer and why it's easy to

374
00:20:37.311 --> 00:20:38.144
get mad at Twitter.

375
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.600
It's harder to look around and figure out what kind of public venues for free

376
00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.900
speech still exist and why they've almost all disappeared.

377
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.670
And while some may propose a free market of ideas to Duke it out,

378
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.190
the free market has always been a fiction.

379
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.430
Ideas are filtered through so many levels of market and constituent of

380
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:58.510
censorship before they can even get written in a book or put on the news while

381
00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:01.960
we should be on the lookout for the Socrates drinking hemlock version of

382
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:04.690
censorship. It's just a small part of the picture.

383
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.200
It's an incredibly complicated problem with no easy solutions.

384
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.310
And for everyone who's saying it is maybe take what they say with a grain of

385
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:13.990
salt I'll end with scholar,

386
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.550
Michael Holquist who writes that censorship is impossible to escape and that the

387
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:22.990
institutions are legislation promising free speech are band-aid solutions.

388
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.700
He says to be for or against censorship as such is to assume a freedom.

389
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:32.320
No one has censorship is one can only discriminate among its

390
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:34.690
more and less repressive effects.

391
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.970
So what do you think is censorship inevitable or should my lifetime ban at taco

392
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:44.140
bell be immediately lifted big thanks to our patrons for all your support

393
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.620
murder, that subscribe button, like you're an Athenian condemning Socrates,

394
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:52.570
and don't forget to ring that bell and as always, thanks for watching later.
