00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.860
<v 1>Crack Helen here today.</v>

3
00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:10.850
We're going to talk about a film that explores the beautiful dynamics of a happy

4
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:14.690
loving family with zero trauma to speak of. Just kidding.

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.580
We're talking about hereditary,

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.920
a movie that makes Thanksgiving at the blues house.

7
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.720
Look like a Norman Rockwell painting.

8
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.360
Hereditary immediately established director.

9
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:26.420
Ari asked her as a bonafide bore Maestro,

10
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.380
but it's worth asking what makes a movie about your typical family?

11
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.440
One of the most disturbing horror films in recent memory,

12
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.530
the answer has nothing to do with naked Colts, demons,

13
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.000
or dark arts and everything to do with your DNA. Don't worry.

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.110
We'll explain in this wisecrack edition on hereditary and of course,

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.340
spoilers ahead. But first, since we can't count on payment for our riches,

16
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.780
we need you, at least, until we find a suitable host for two bucks a month,

you can get ad free access to all of wisecracks videos before anyone else that's

18
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:02.000
like too spicy potato soft tacos. What she won't be able to eat anymore anyway,

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.020
for a little more and still substantially less than your whole family dying.

20
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.350

23
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.850
And now back to the show, hereditary centers around artists, Andy Graham,

24
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.180
who is sort of in mourning over the death of her estranged mother,

25
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.300
before she can even process that loss though, her daughter,

26
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:30.230
Charlie is killed in a free car accident while her son is at the wheel.

27
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.050
As Andy's whole world subsequently crumbles a mysterious woman,

28
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:39.140
teaches her to perform a seance, the channel's Charlie spirit,

29
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.290
and that's where everything goes a little, uh, off the rails.

30
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.230
Eventually we learned that Annie's dead.

31
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:49.160
Mom was part of a totally bananas pagan cult that is looking for a vessel for

32
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:50.990
its favorite demon by the end.

33
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.930
Pretty much everyone is the headedly worshiping Charlie spirit,

34
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.000
which has been planted into Peter's body. So why is it so scary?

35
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.820
Well, partially because it contains stuff like this.

36
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.160
<v 0>But.</v>

37
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.320
<v 1>Horror films that really shake us,</v>

38
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.520
tend to anchor even their most supernatural scares in our real life fears.

39
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.190
In hereditary case, the clue is in the name,

40
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.000
it's the story of a family doomed to misery by their lineage.

41
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.120
While most of us probably don't have to worry about our grandmothers being

42
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:24.290
secret. Occultists the idea that we might suffer for our parents' sins is pretty

43
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:28.490
universal and that universality has everything to do with hereditary scare

44
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:29.324
factor.

45
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.800
See some of the most unhinged events of the film can be explained by the concept

46
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.120
of refreshing. One of the cornerstones of Sigmund Freud, psychoanalytic theory.

47
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.410
Repression is the process by which the conscious mind is shielded from feelings

48
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:42.861
and thoughts,

49
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:46.790
which are too painful to acknowledge these buried emotions are left to fester,

50
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.600
unresolved,

51
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.100
and often manifest themselves in occasionally alarming ways like a,

52
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.390
this Indeed.

53
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.850
Annie is a case study in repression per life has been littered with tragedies

54
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:04.360
that she's unable to fully confront in her eulogy for her mother.

55
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.880
Any tries to find nice words to say,

56
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.050
but inadvertently ends up stressing how emotionally unavailable and controlling.

57
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.780
<v 2>Was. My mother was a very secretive and private woman.</v>

58
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.300
She had private rituals, private friends, private anxieties.

59
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.170
<v 1>And he's true feelings bubble beneath the surface to repress,</v>

60
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:28.170
to be articulated and too powerful to be let go.

61
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.740
This is pretty blatant for shadowing any,

62
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.380
he doesn't know how sinister her mother's private rituals were or that the

63
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:38.460
strange faces she sees in the pews are actually members of Ellen's Colt, right?

64
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:39.294
From the beginning,

65
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.780
the things that the Graham family hides are sowing the seeds of their own

66
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:43.614
destruction.

67
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.400
Amy's repression makes honest communication with those closest to her difficult.

68
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.570
If not impossible.

69
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.220
<v 3>It's gets too cold. Come back in.</v>

70
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.330
<v 1>The only place she'll talk about her traumatic past is that a grief support</v>

71
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:04.230
group full of strangers, even then she's completely detached,

72
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.830
reeling off the laundry list of horrifying things that occurred during her

73
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.320
childhood in an almost casual way.

74
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.570
<v 2>She didn't have an easy life she had did,</v>

75
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:16.290
which became extreme at the end and dementia.

76
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.680
My older brother had schizophrenia and when he was 16,

77
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:25.880
he hanged himself in my mother's bedroom. And of course the suicide note point,

78
00:04:25.881 --> 00:04:29.580
her accusing her of putting people inside him. So.

79
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.290
<v 3>That was my mom's.</v>

80
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.280
<v 1>It's notable that any finishes this speech by distancing herself from the</v>

81
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:41.880
narrative, these are her mother's traumas, not hers,

82
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.220
even when acknowledging her family's history.

83
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.400
She's unwilling to accept it as part of her story.

84
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.330
And he's not unique in her inability to deal with tragedy during what Freud

85
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.240
calls, the first use of the psychoanalytic approach,

86
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.010
the patient and an O was encouraged to make political compositions that could

87
00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:01.170
offer her relief from her chronic anxiety,

88
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.310
using art to express what she couldn't say out loud fittingly and he's art

89
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:06.600
functions in the same way.

90
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.470
She makes miniature doll houses that recreate her traumatic life events.

91
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.340
However,

92
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.840
it's not accurate to call Andy's creepy model home therapeutic Freud emphasize

93
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.960
that it's not enough to artistically depict traumatic events.

94
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.790
The patient also has to engage with the emotions attached even as any

95
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.250
recreates, her past traumas and my new detail.

96
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.920
She refuses to acknowledge the emotional payload.

97
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:32.940
They carry something which becomes ghoulishly clear after she creates a bleak

98
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:35.970
depiction of Charlie's death and Peter's role in it. It's.

99
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.250
<v 3>Not about him. No, no. It's.</v>

100
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.870
<v 1>A neutral view of the accident,</v>

101
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.900
but any strange behavior is ultimately understandable.

102
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.530
She's coping with her trauma all on her own. When tragedy strikes,

103
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.880
we hope to lean on the people around us for support often relying on a stable

104
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:52.800
familial structure to hold us together.

105
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.060
However many modern familial units are really not set up to deal with such

106
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.730
emotions. In fact, many aren't really set up to deal with emotions at all.

107
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.320
Don't you swear at me don't you ever raise your voice at me.

108
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.490
I am your mother.

109
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.260
And that brings us to what really makes hereditary so scary family

110
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.640
in these surprisingly whimsical bestseller families and how to survive them.

111
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.600
Dr. Robin Skinner and British comedian, John Cleese elucidate.

112
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.980
Why talking openly with our loved ones can feel so impossible and its lessons

113
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:27.140
become all too relevant in hereditary,

114
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.100
which is all about people who are fundamentally unable to survive their own

115
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:31.900
family.

116
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.600
<v 3>Or like ponds this horrible hopeless machine.</v>

117
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.410
<v 1>The book centers on the premise that most of our attitudes and characteristics</v>

118
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.030
are grounded in our original family experience and relationships and argues that

119
00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:46.840
repressed people tend to form family units that are also repressive.

120
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.130
I E the Graham's Annie and her husband, Steve lie to one another,

121
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:53.290
rather than dealing with upsetting emotions.

122
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.260
She hides the fact that she is going to a grief support group,

123
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.500
and he hides the fact that her mother's grave has been desecrated.

124
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.190
His chronic inability to communicate soon comes back to haunt them.

125
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.413
Where was it?

126
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.070
<v 4>Just some billing crap. Okay, well, I'm, uh, I'm going to go see a movie.</v>

127
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.600
<v 1>The perpetual secrecy that hangs over their relationship leads to mistrust and</v>

128
00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:20.980
even paranoia as when Steve accuses any herself of being responsible for

129
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.443
desecrating the grave.

130
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.820
<v 4>The grade was you wasn't it all those nights.</v>

131
00:07:27.821 --> 00:07:29.350
You were pretended to go to the movies.

132
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.360
<v 1>Here. The staggeringly toxic results of family wide repression become abundantly</v>

133
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:34.870
clear.

134
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.500
And the same is true for the Graham's children after the grandmother's funeral,

135
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.461
Annie and Steve,

136
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:43.480
try to prompt Charlie and Peter to open up about their feelings to no avail,

137
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.810
not surprising given their parents reluctance to honestly voice their own

138
00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:47.470
emotions.

139
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.430
Charlie is repressed to the point where she barely talks responding to emotional

140
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:55.300
stimuli with a strange and truly terrifying clicking noise. Instead,

141
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.540
she is particularly unable to express anything negative or confrontational when

142
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:04.870
forced into an argument, she simply concedes that's okay.

143
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.680
And we learned that her practice of suppressing emotions started very early,

144
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.960
never cried as a baby. Peter,

145
00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:17.290
on the other hand, buries his emotions under a cloud of marijuana smoke,

146
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.540
normally sleep walking through much of the day.

147
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.620
His parents do the same popping prescription pills to blank out their own

148
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:24.340
feelings.

149
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.570
So what happens when you make four deeply repressed people share a home,

150
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.130
you know, stuff like this

151
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.140
Grams are completely cut off from one another emotionally compartmentalize into

152
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:41.050
separate rooms. As if in one of Andy's miniatures,

153
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.910
even in the wake of Ellen's death,

154
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.810
the family is more concerned with how they are supposed to feel than how they

155
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.770
actually feel.

156
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.180
<v 4>Should I say you should be whatever you are.</v>

157
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.890
It'll come.

158
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.020
<v 1>As a result. The are totally unequipped to deal with Charlie's death,</v>

159
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.430
which has made gallingly clear by Peter's decision to cocoon himself in bed,

160
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.830
leaving his parents to discover her body.

161
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.950
He is so unable to process the trauma and his role in it that he simply shuts

162
00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:20.660
down in an emotionally healthy family. The trauma of Charlie's death, though,

163
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.430
intolerably painful could be the impetus for self-reflection and even

164
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:29.360
growth in life and how to survive it. Another book written by the doctor,

165
00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:34.340
comedian duo Skinner explains that the healthier people are the more they are

166
00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:36.290
willing to admit to their limitations.

167
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.220
And so the more open they are to the possibility of improvement,

168
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.000
but the grams were emotionally unhealthy. Even before the tragedy in its wake,

169
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.340
that they are unable to reckon with the pain or even ask for help.

170
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.730
In the rare moments, when the Graham's do talk about their feelings,

171
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.480
it gets ugly fast in one exchange, any projects,

172
00:09:56.481 --> 00:10:00.920
many of her own problems onto Peter or refusing to recognize them in herself.

173
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.300
Even at this explosive moment, she continues to repress her feelings,

174
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.790
specifically her guilt about Charlie's death.

175
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.860
<v 3>I can't accept. And I can't forgive because</v>

176
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.060
what about you, mom? She didn't want to go to the party.

177
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.743
Why was she there?

178
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.390
<v 1>But any his inability to get in touch with her feelings,</v>

179
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.890
isn't some kind of moral failing. It was somewhat inevitable.

180
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.570
Skinner talks about how many of our painful experiences are ultimately a

181
00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:40.190
simple consequence of family history over which no one had any

182
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.400
control for the grams. This is certainly true.

183
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.650
Their grandmother ultimately dooms them,

184
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.590
but not just because of her pagan machinations,

185
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.030
rather her most potent legacy is her emotional detachment,

186
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.160
which continues to drive her family apart. Even after she's gone. In this sense,

187
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.640
the grams are beset by a very real family curse.

188
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.850
They each inherit the repressive tendencies of their parents,

189
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.450
which causes their trauma to fester until it's out of control,

190
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.980
as any explains in her eulogy, her mother was an emotionally distant person,

191
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.920
unable to offer her the love or support that she needed.

192
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:20.690
Fittingly Cleese argues that many of our problems are really childhood

193
00:11:20.691 --> 00:11:25.160
difficulties that we fail to resolve when we were young and consequently carry

194
00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:27.230
around with us in our adult lives.

195
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.090
It's no surprise then that Annie inherited a complex damaged idea of what it was

196
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:35.720
to be a mother, which in turn instilled a deep fear of becoming one.

197
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.590
She represses that fear though, burying it in her unconscious.

198
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.580
So it can only manifest in her dreams. I didn't feel like a mother,

199
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.930
both her dreamed confession and her murderous sleepwalking are byproducts of

200
00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:50.450
these unwanted unthinkable ideas.

201
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.830
Any remains unable to accept them as of herself,

202
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.380
even after she almost burns her children alive.

203
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.500
She refuses to admit the severity of the situation.

204
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.720
<v 2>Standing there with a box of matches and an empty canopy dinner.</v>

205
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.310
And I woke myself up striking the match,

206
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.100
which also what Peter up and he started screaming.

207
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:11.761
<v 1>To do.</v>

208
00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:15.480
So would mean acknowledging the part of her that wanted to harm her children,

209
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.230
shattering her already tenuous maternal identity. I mean.

210
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.300
<v 2>I was just as shocked as he was,</v>

211
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.350
and it was impossible to convince them that it was just sleep walking.

212
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.430
<v 1>Unable to process her childhood traumas. She replicates them.</v>

213
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.980
She unwittingly neglects, her children,

214
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.000
even giving Charlie to Ellen in a desperate attempt to win the approval.

215
00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:37.110
She still craves.

216
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.660
<v 2>Let her anywhere near me. When I had my first, my son,</v>

217
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.890
which is why I gave her my daughter, who she immediately stabbed her hooks into.

218
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:49.080
<v 1>And in turn, she creates kids who are just like her repressing,</v>

219
00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:52.980
their traumatic childhood experiences to preserve an image of normalcy,

220
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.700
Peter and Charlie can't confront the idea that their mother tried to kill them

221
00:12:56.701 --> 00:13:00.990
or in Charlie's case, functionally gave her away any more than Annie can.

222
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.070
So the whole family continues stumbling forward and willful ignorance.

223
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.330
And this is where the freaky supernatural elements of the film becomes so

224
00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:10.164
important.

225
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.030
The family's increasingly creepy experiences are symbolic of their dysfunction.

226
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:15.930
As a result,

227
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.170
they are blinded to all the signs that something sinister is brewing.

228
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.500
Even as they, each individually notice markings and apparitions,

229
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.340
they are unable to communicate about them for fear that their sanity will be

230
00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:28.230
called into question. In fact,

231
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.220
Ellen's pagan tendencies only go unnoticed in the first place because of how

232
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.650
distant she and Annie are when she dies.

233
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.950
All her secrets are there to be discovered in a box in the attic,

234
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.620
but no one finds them until it is too late.

235
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.540
Fittingly the front emotional associations Annie has with her mother ensure she

236
00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:49.140
won't do the work of sorting her belongings or her own emotions.

237
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.540
This lays the groundwork for Ellen's creepy friend,

238
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.050
Joan to enact the later stages of their plan. Sure.

239
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.170
They have hundreds of years of demonic knowledge and mystical energy on their

240
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.690
side, but their plan would be a non-starter.

241
00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:03.510
If Annie had taken a brief flick through her, mom's old things,

242
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.620
the family's maladjustment makes them vulnerable in the first place after

243
00:14:07.621 --> 00:14:11.850
drawing any in Joan offers her a basic psychological defense

244
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.610
denial. If any can believe in the seance,

245
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.580
then she doesn't have to really face the fact that Charlie is dead.

246
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.660
Doesn't have to reckon with her involvement in her death or reconciled that with

247
00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:24.900
her fear of motherhood. So long as Charlie isn't dead,

248
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.600
that can all remain buried. You didn't kill him.

249
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.983
<v 2>She isn't.</v>

250
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.710
<v 1>But the sands also serves a larger psychological purpose.</v>

251
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.000
Dr. Skinner talks about how feeling plugged into a meaningful cosmic system

252
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.630
gives people a greater psychological balance and stability.

253
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.880
And that's exactly what Jones mysticism offers. Annie, her home life,

254
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.650
her whole world has been shattered and Joan offers her a way to piece it back

255
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:00.020
together to reconstruct her family.

256
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.770
Of course it is not inherently supernatural to believe that some part of the

257
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:05.690
people we lose lives on in us,

258
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.490
but sometimes it's not exactly the parts we would like several studies about

259
00:15:10.491 --> 00:15:13.790
transgenerational trauma have suggested that the descendants of those who

260
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:18.440
undergo great suffering might carry the psychological markers of it themselves,

261
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.390
potentially leaving them more vulnerable to PTSD, anxiety, depression,

262
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.590
and other conditions.

263
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.130
One of the first studies into this phenomenon was undertaken by Canadian

264
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:30.560
psychiatrist, Vivian M Rakoff,

265
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.000
who found that the children of Holocaust survivors showed uncommonly high rates

266
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:39.710
of psychological distress Ralph's findings in subsequent studies give evidence

267
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:41.840
to the idea that trauma is passed down,

268
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.720
not only through the influence of our parents' behavior,

269
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.660
but through their genetic material in this way,

270
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.400
Ellen passes her own trauma on to Annie and Annie passes it on to Peter and

271
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:53.060
Charlie.

272
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.050
Each member of the family has developed their own repressive mechanisms to

273
00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.720
ensure that their demons are never exercised.

274
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.870
Eventually those demons will destroy them.

275
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:07.310
The supernatural forces at play naturally paralleled the severe mental illness,

276
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:08.420
which runs in the family,

277
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.470
demonic possession and curses after all have historically been used as

278
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:16.370
explanations for mental health problems that could not be otherwise understood.

279
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.180
Ellen's husband and son both killed themselves as a result of schizophrenia or

280
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:21.260
psychotic depression.

281
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.500
Although her sons claimed that she was putting voices inside him,

282
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.890
raises the question of whether she was experimenting with demon raising,

283
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.440
even back then through these acts of violence,

284
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.160
the family self-destructive legacy is passed onto each member,

285
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.870
dooming them to the same bloody fate as those who came before much of who we are

286
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:39.890
is hereditary.

287
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.270
It's why so many of us can probably relate to Annie and her family feeling

288
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:48.200
somewhat doomed to repeat the past. And one day turn into our parents.

289
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.620
Ultimately the thing which locks the Graham family into their fate,

290
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.870
isn't ancient rites or mysterious ruins,

291
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.640
but their own inability to process the trauma they have undergone they suppress

292
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.140
and suppress and suppress it until it finally explodes.

293
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.370
The violence which comes exploding out is filled with darkly, poetic,

294
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:09.080
repetitions, and reversals,

295
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.010
any beheads herself in a gory imitation of Charlie's death.

296
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.210
Her nighttime fantasies of burning a family member alive come true.

297
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:18.830
When Steve goes up in flames.

298
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:21.880
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

299
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.180
<v 1>Oppression and trauma lock them into a cycle and they're tortured.</v>

300
00:17:25.181 --> 00:17:30.070
Family history seems doomed to repeat itself until they have all been destroyed.

301
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.900
But what do you guys think?

302
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.570
Are we all doomed to repeat our family's dysfunction?
