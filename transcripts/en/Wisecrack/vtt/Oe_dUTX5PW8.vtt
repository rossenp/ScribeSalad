00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.810
<v 1>Wisecrack Michael here. And the early days of the 21st century,</v>

2
00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:11.840
Travis Scott was just a kid in Houston who loved happy meals.

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.560
Face masks were reserved mostly for hospitals in Halloween and adult swim was

4
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:18.860
just a late night block of programming that showed cartoons aimed at, uh,

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.660
mellow adults rather than Caprice on fuel children. Then these guys came along,

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.430
mixing their love of public access,

7
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:28.940
television and underground art with absurdism and cultural commentary.

8
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.000
Their comedy was equal parts, awkwardness, and horror.

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.330
And while they started with obscure shows that aired at four in the morning,

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.340
they've now become legit celebrities,

11
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.550
appearing in major films and television and taking their talents into other

12
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:44.690
fields like pop music and artisanal wine-making along the way they transformed

13
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:47.930
the sensibility of adult swim and along with it modern comedy.

14
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.520
So how has an obscure comedy duo gone on to have such a massive impact across

15
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:55.880
popular culture and how have they stayed true to their roots in the process?

16
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.630
Did Tim and Eric take on these soul sucking entertainment industry?

17
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.830
And when let's find out in this wisecrack edition on the philosophy of Tim and

18
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:04.491
Eric, okay,

19
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:08.570
I want to take a break from talking about one awesome show to talk about an

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.920
awesome podcast, which is wisecracks culture bench. So hosted by me,

21
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:14.510
along with Alec and Serby,

22
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.870
and it's where we breakdown everything happening in the cultural zeitgeists,

23
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.450
whether that be we're new developments in online,

24
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:23.840
dating how your boomer parents ruined your life for how in the hell people were

25
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:25.430
playing sports inside of a bubble.

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.930

If you would give us a review, check it out every other Wednesday,

29
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.010
link in the description. Now back to the show, first,

30
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:43.250
a quick rundown on the duo. After meeting in film school,

31
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:46.850
Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim took advantage of the gear Eric was using for

32
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:49.970
his bar mitzvah videography business to film comedy sketches.

33
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.560
Eventually they sent a DVD to Bob Odenkirk, also known as attorney salt Goodman,

34
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.960
who became an early champion of their work.

35
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.110
This led to their first adult swim show. Tom goes to the mayor,

36
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.110
lasting two seasons adult swim calls, the animated series.

37
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.600
One of the most polarizing shows they've ever made.

38
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.290
<v 2>We're going to need at least 10,000 of your finest traps,</v>

39
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.080
whatever it takes to keep those kids safe.

40
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.080
<v 1>Wild irreverence, and unabashedly, dark humor.</v>

41
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:19.220
It paved the way for their mature work, Tim and Eric. Awesome show. Great job.

42
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.210
Good job.

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.890
And this is what really took them from obscure animation anarchists to legit

44
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.280
cult heroes building on many of the same themes and characters.

45
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.320
Awesome show created an entire alternate reality of surreal lo-fi television.

46
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.220
Taking the aesthetics of a public access show and tossing an actors found on

47
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:37.850
Craigslist.

48
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.180
It feels like an awkward Thanksgiving dinner with your aunt and uncle who you

49
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.550
suspect might actually already be dead.

50
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.690
So how did two comedians who don't even tell jokes worm their way into the

51
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:48.524
mainstream?

52
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.430
<v 2>Fine. Mom makes me take my nips. Cause my nips gets bloody when the skin rips,</v>

53
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.600
cause I wear a tight shirt that chase my nips, nobody likes bloody nips.

54
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.680
<v 1>One way we can understand it is via the tradition of outsider art.</v>

55
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.250
This term is used to describe art created by people outside of the mainstream

56
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:05.620
tradition and often with no formal training.

57
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.990
Often these artists create work that feels like it's from.

58
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.353
<v 3>Another world.</v>

59
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.920
<v 1>There's also a tradition of outsider.</v>

60
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.920
Art created by both children and folks with mental disabilities.

61
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.680
Some famous examples in visual art are Henry Dodger,

62
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:22.800
a janitor whose work was discovered by his landlord after he died.

63
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.730
And Vivian Maier,

64
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.760
a street photographer whose work was also found after her death.

65
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.690
And it's not a stretch to include Tim and Eric in this tradition to the lucky

66
00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:33.960
for us, we didn't have to wait for their passing to discover their work.

67
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.210
They began creating comedy in Philadelphia,

68
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.090
outside the traditional power centers of LA and New York.

69
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.120
And rather than working their way up the ranks from the inside,

70
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.240
they simply reached out to one of their comedy heroes and got a show mate with

71
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:48.150
no previous TV experience. And since then,

72
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:50.580
their work has largely been broadcast on adult swim,

73
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.010
which lies on the fringes of mainstream culture.

74
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.810
While they did attend at film school,

75
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.920
it's clear that they learn more from low quality public access TV than they did

76
00:03:58.921 --> 00:03:59.910
from classic cinema.

77
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.080
They've also relied on the power of Craigslist to find mostly older performers

78
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:06.210
living on the margins of the entertainment industry.

79
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.680
One of their regular singer and puppeteer David Leba Hart is a legitimate

80
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.270
outsider artist in his own right?

81
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.320
Having spent years as a street performer before becoming a staple on awesome

82
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:17.040
show,

83
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.580
they even tried to develop a television series with the dark Prince of outsider,

84
00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:22.470
cinema himself, Tommy Wiseau.

85
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.130
This outsider status is important to their work because it allows them to

86
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:30.360
satirize and explore media culture from a true critical distance with no

87
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:34.110
responsibility or desire to fatefully emulate mainstream television.

88
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.120
And it's clear that their artistic influences,

89
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:39.870
which are more David Lynch and Wolf man Jack than Adam Sandler and Chevy chase

90
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:42.450
are outside the realm of traditional sketch comedy.

91
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.770
Most traditional comedic television has largely pacifying effect on the viewer,

92
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.730
making us feel good without provoking any difficult questions or emotions,

93
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.690
whether it's a political sketch on SNL that makes most of its audience not in

94
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:58.770
semi snug agreement or an episode of the good place that makes us smile because

95
00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:01.440
we also believe in the eternal magic of friendship.

96
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.860
Most comedic TV exists to make us feel comfortable and safe.

97
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.410
And if these types of shows are a weighted blanket,

98
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:09.210
making us feel safe and warm,

99
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.020
then Tim and Eric awesome show is like a raccoon that's snorted crystal meth

100
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:16.320
broke into your bedroom and figured out a place Slayer on iTunes.

101
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.790
<v 3>Happy birthday spray. I'm disappointed in you in honey, take this.</v>

102
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.211
<v 1>Gotcha.</v>

103
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:24.390
And which a couple and announces they're divorced to their heartbroken children.

104
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.860
And then they reveal why mom is leaving for a younger and more handsome man who

105
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.990
burglarized to their house last week.

106
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.740
Your mommy's in love with a burglar and dad is going to live on the streets for

107
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:36.930
a while. It's super uncomfortable.

108
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.290
So how did Tim and Eric break the tension and infuse some comedy?

109
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.663
<v 3>Perfect.</v>

110
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.450
Are we coming to here.

111
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.781
<v 1>Then?</v>

112
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:53.610
Usually dark scenario is hilariously undercut by something simple and childish

113
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.680
or consider Fortin with will a sketch model. After a fun segment,

114
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.460
that slowly becomes a disturbing recollection of someone's own childhood.

115
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.000
<v 3>Don't flush them. Try likes.</v>

116
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.020
I want you to leave those logs in there for me to inspect.

117
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.070
<v 1>Work is often uncomfortable to watch even for seasoned fans.</v>

118
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.520
<v 3>Excuse me. When I think about my father,</v>

119
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.350
sometimes there is an involuntary release from here.

120
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.290
<v 1>Personally. I still cover my eyes and season five,</v>

121
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.230
as they get their eyes eaten out by crows while an Irish,

122
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.360
Dwight Truett warns them about the dark man.

123
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.400
<v 3>Man power.</v>

124
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.930
<v 1>At moments like this,</v>

125
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:32.920
they lean heavy into the horror genre to confuse our brains comedy receptors.

126
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.030
Unlike the pacifying and affirming nature of so much mainstream comedy,

127
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.200
Tim and Eric's work can feel antagonistic as if they are pushing the audience to

128
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:42.670
see how much we can take.

129
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.140
They take existing cultural norms and either ignore them or subvert them beyond

130
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:47.974
recognition.

131
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.390
<v 3>Having a going out of business.</v>

132
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.040
<v 1>Eric also take aim at consumer culture,</v>

133
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.300
finding bizarre new ways to explore our dysfunctional relationship with and

134
00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:00.100
desire for material goods.

135
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.390
<v 3>It's got one 97, 99, 69 cheap.</v>

136
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.340
<v 1>Work is less political than anthropological diving into the world of advertising</v>

137
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:13.150
and marketing so they can slowly pull it apart from the inside out as critic

138
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:14.320
Frank wan describes it.

139
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.550
What's most striking about the awesome show is not the comprehensiveness of its

140
00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:20.560
critique, but its gentleness.

141
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.520
The illusions of Congress are not stabbed to death so much is silently stripped

142
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.920
bare, take their commercial for the jammer.

143
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.880
A children's toy based on the Bobbitt that has no discernible function other

144
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:34.690
than destroying the minds of kids and filling them with the seemingly insatiable

145
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:36.850
desire for an utterly useless thing.

146
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.980
<v 3>Monitor your friends, progress three bumpin.</v>

147
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.430
It's straight.

148
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.150
<v 1>Funny until you step back and reflect on the way much of our media exists to</v>

149
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.770
sell it. We don't need, but nonetheless we lust after it like an annuity dog,

150
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.850
let loose at a thick leg convention as journalists Keith, a Spencer put it,

151
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.810
the brilliance lies and how Tim and Eric take the signs and signifiers of late

152
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:05.650
capitalist consumption and stretch them until they are unidentifiable.

153
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.890
It's an outrageous satire of consumerist excess.

154
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.430
And this critique of consumerism hits so hard because again,

155
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.120
it's created by outsiders who haven't bought into this culture,

156
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.510
but just like what happened with everything from punk rock to video games to

157
00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:23.650
dipping your pizza and ranch things that start as counter-cultural and outside

158
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:26.740
the mainstream are eventually co-opted by those in power,

159
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.530
which is why your pastor Richard's favorite band is green day.

160
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.830
The quarterback of your high school football team has his own Twitch stream and

161
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.210
high-end pizza shops offer housemate artisinal ranch for an extra one 50 and

162
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.140
awesome show is no exception to the ranch covered rule. First,

163
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.870
Tim and Eric attracted some top-notch comedy talent,

164
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.850
including cameos from Paul Rudd,

165
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:49.540
Zach Galifianakis will Farrell and Ted Danson.

166
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.650
Then clinically middlebrow shows like Saturday night live started to adopt their

167
00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:56.010
awkward and uncomfortable. In fact,

168
00:08:56.011 --> 00:09:00.450
SNL both produced a sketch that arguably ripped off at Tim and Eric sketch and

169
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.090
aired sketches like this, which clearly crib,

170
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:06.600
the comedic aesthetics of Tim and Eric down to the cadence of Kristen Wiggs

171
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:07.230
delivered.

172
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.360
<v 4>I'm taking myself a hot air balloon ride.</v>

173
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.760
<v 1>Of course the main difference is that here,</v>

174
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.080
the antagonism of an actual awesome show sketch is treated for a more

175
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:17.610
commercially palatable, awkward.

176
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.090
<v 4>I've touched a clown. Now I'm going to jail.</v>

177
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.440
<v 1>Same influence with antagonism traded for awkwardness and a show like</v>

178
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.303
Portlandia,

179
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.430
which is basically for people who love the absurdity of awesome show,

180
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:32.150
but also appreciate the safety and comfort of a Subaru Outback. For example,

181
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.410
Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein have their ongoing fanciful gender mending

182
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.180
romance story and comparison.

183
00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:41.570
Tim and Eric have this recurring sketch about the dysfunctional relationship

184
00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:43.400
between Carol and Mr. Henderson.

185
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.350
<v 5>Get me rock hard. Thank you. I just had my hair cut,</v>

186
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.213
which eventually.

187
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.490
<v 1>Ends with Henderson being half guillotined and dying.</v>

188
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.550
<v 5>Can you imagine getting your head cut off one of these Gies?</v>

189
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.420
<v 1>Well, Carol is a radically negative by as nurse.</v>

190
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.930
<v 4>Whoa, you are one big weird eggplant.</v>

191
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.273
<v 1>Romance stuff.</v>

192
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.270
Generally take any comedy that years more towards awkward and absurd than it

193
00:10:08.271 --> 00:10:08.451
does.

194
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:12.470
Traditionally funny send some of its juices to a genetics lab and it's bound to

195
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:15.620
come back at least 65% Tim and Eric and its ancestry.

196
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.070
They've also had a more direct influence on shaping modern comedy with their

197
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:20.600
absolutely productions,

198
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.870
which is responsible for everything from the late night absurdism of the Eric

199
00:10:23.871 --> 00:10:27.890
Andre show to the Canadian business school wisdom of Nathan for you and so on.

200
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.940
Tim and Eric have used their success as outsiders working on the inside of the

201
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:36.110
entertainment industry to bring a whole bunch of other weird unlikely comedy

202
00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:37.220
stars. Along with them.

203
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.930
It's like they somehow got seats in first class and slowly all their dirt bag

204
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:43.520
friends from coach up there with them.

205
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.540
<v 4>Pancakes couldn't kill me because I was already dead.</v>

206
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.050
<v 1>Now influencing other television shows and comedians is one thing,</v>

207
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.620
but these two beef boys might've had their biggest influence on his space,

208
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.890
not normally kind to avant-garde and counter-cultural artists,

209
00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.240
corporate advertising.

210
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.370
<v 4>Have your lighting servant to get a GE link light bulb for only 1497.</v>

211
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.580
That's less than what I tip the guy who tips people for me.

212
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.380
<v 1>Even if many folks will tragically never watch an episode of awesome show or</v>

213
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:13.100
beef house.

214
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.150
Anyone who's regularly watched American television in the past decade has seen a

215
00:11:17.151 --> 00:11:21.860
commercial either created by or heavily influenced by Tim and Eric. For example,

216
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.300
if you liked me,

217
00:11:23.301 --> 00:11:27.260
if slathered a stick of old spice under your dank underarms every morning for

218
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:30.920
the past 10 years after Terry crews threatened you, how was it?

219
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.840
You almost definitely were influenced by the advertising of Tim and Eric,

220
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.350
but Arctic for smelling armpits aside. Isn't it kind of weird.

221
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.070
The two outsider artists who largely cut their teeth by securing the sick

222
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:44.420
emptiness of consumer culture.

223
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.590
They've gone on to make ads for the likes of Google GoDaddy boost mobile GE,

224
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:52.670
and BRBO presumably all aimed at selling you. You don't need maybe,

225
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.730
but we are willing to suspend judgment.

226
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.580
There might be something even deeper going on here.

227
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.050
Now at first it might seem bizarre if not genuinely disappointing that the guys

228
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:05.350
behind the jammer would become admin in layman's terms.

229
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:09.100
This is usually called selling out like Matthew McConaughey using his

230
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:13.150
hypnotizing, Texas drawl, the cellular Lincoln SUV or Travis Scott,

231
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:17.260
letting you know that if you buy as McDonald's meal and accompanying $80 chicken

232
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:21.580
McNugget pillow, that things will once and for all truly be lit. So Howard,

233
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:25.210
Tim and Eric able to work in the world of advertising without embracing the type

234
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:28.540
of hollow consumerism. They've always hated in 2008,

235
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:32.320
Heidecker said in an interview, we both despise advertising and marketing.

236
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.350
You can't avoid it. And it's always so inane.

237
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.990
I find that we're constantly being treated like children,

238
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.230
even with other forms of media. And in the very same year,

239
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:45.040
they won a Webby for their absolute vodka ad, told them three parts.

240
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.150
The ad featuring Zach Galifianakis seems to retain a lot of Tim and Eric

241
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:52.810
signature style, weird wigs, mundane conversations, turning violent,

242
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.490
uncomfortable sexual energy,

243
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.400
all culminating in a full-scale emotional breakdown,

244
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.420
the actual endorsement for absolute doesn't come until the third installment of

245
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.830
an almost 15 minute long.

246
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.440
<v 3>Commercial. Do you guys like absolute?</v>

247
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:09.870
I have.

248
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.210
<v 1>That. And it sounds about as genuine as Tom Selleck,</v>

249
00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:14.820
trying to get your grandparents to reverse mortgage their condoms.

250
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.870
It's just alone.

251
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.250
This ad clearly isn't a slimy as a lot of celebrity commercials and it doesn't

252
00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:24.480
sacrifice Tim and Eric signature aesthetic, but is it doing anything subversive?

253
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.990
Eric had this to say in an interview with the believer we wanted to work with

254
00:13:27.991 --> 00:13:30.030
the comedian, Zach Galifianakis, who we love,

255
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.780
we were also allowed to do anything. We wanted absolute head approach Zack,

256
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.690
and they were basically paying all of us to make an anti ad.

257
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.100
How could we have said no,

258
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.510
of course you could argue that this ad is mostly about giving absolute some

259
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.830
underground cultural cred and ensuring potential consumers that they're down

260
00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:48.060
with Tim and Eric's vibe.

261
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.170
But an example of the duo using a commercial deal to be slightly more subversive

262
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:54.480
is their ad for Totonno's pizza rolls.

263
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.270
If they're absolute ad tries to avoid reminding you,

264
00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:59.910
you're watching a commercial by barely mentioning the product.

265
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.050
This one goes the opposite route using a near constant repetition of the word

266
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:06.600
Totonno's and a sort of punk rock song about pizza, right?

267
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.373
<v 3>Pizza rolls.</v>

268
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.850
<v 1>Virtual feels like a knowing,</v>

269
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.880
wink to those who who'd accused them of losing their punk rock credibility.

270
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.700
At one point, Hardrock, Joe even tells us.

271
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.980
<v 3>Can keep all that corporate BS arm until punk pizza</v>

272
00:14:22.981 --> 00:14:24.600
rolls with Tony chinos.

273
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.950
<v 1>So is this technically an advertisement for low quality pizza nuggets? Sure.</v>

274
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.100
But is it doing anything to earnestly sell a product? No.

275
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.540
<v 3>Really. Hi, I'm Tennessee, a pizza freak and I have a secret.</v>

276
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.320
I am pizza Tortino's boy.

277
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.311
<v 1>If anything,</v>

278
00:14:41.311 --> 00:14:45.810
it grows increasingly disturbing and makes you wonder if the Totonno's lifestyle

279
00:14:45.811 --> 00:14:49.380
is code for some sort of process to mozzarella fueled sex school.

280
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.620
If it weren't made explicit at the end of the ad,

281
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.040
you could be forgiven for assuming this wasn't a commercial at all,

282
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.860
but a sketch using a gross snack is fodder for absurdity.

283
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:04.750
<v 3>So.</v>

284
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.770
<v 1>On a charitable reading,</v>

285
00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:10.120
it seems that Tim and Eric are at times able to use advertising to subvert the

286
00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:12.580
fundamental expectations of the influencer economy.

287
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.490
Whereas Lincoln is using the star of failure to launch,

288
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.240
to sell luxury SUV's and McDonald's is using the Mozart of Auto-Tune to sell

289
00:15:19.241 --> 00:15:20.500
fries and barbecue sauce.

290
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.760
Tim and Eric are at least using companies like absolute and total Tino's to make

291
00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:25.594
weird comedy.

292
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.190
<v 3>Tortino's Latinos, Latinos, Latinos, Latinos, Latinos.</v>

293
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.630
Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.570
<v 1>Our most generous. We could argue that in doing this,</v>

295
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.200
they are performing the same type of satire they did with the jammer sketch,

296
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.120
except they were simply subbing out a fictional,

297
00:15:40.121 --> 00:15:42.460
useless product for real useless products.

298
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.050
But as anyone who has seen Andy Warhol soup cans knows this wouldn't be the

299
00:15:47.051 --> 00:15:51.190
first time that an underground artists performative critique of consumerism was

300
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:55.000
appropriated by the very culture it's set out to critique. Now,

301
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.690
does this actively support the idea that Tim and Eric are still outsider

302
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.830
artists? Not really.

303
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.910
As most outsider artists live in poverty or psychiatric facilities make almost

304
00:16:03.911 --> 00:16:06.910
no money and rarely receive credit for their work and their lifetime.

305
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.000
So wouldn't it technically made Tim and Eric more punk rock.

306
00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:13.570
If someone discovered a box full of comedy DVDs under their adult bunk beds

307
00:16:13.571 --> 00:16:16.570
after they died in obscurity, maybe, but honestly,

308
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.570
we're glad that they've gotten to receive some praise and of course,

309
00:16:19.571 --> 00:16:23.590
compensation for their work while they're still around to enjoy it. And in turn,

310
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.330
we're glad we've gotten this.

311
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:30.640
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

312
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.940
<v 1>But what do you think wisecrack are Tim and Eric pushing the boundaries of</v>

313
00:16:33.941 --> 00:16:35.500
comedy as a critical art form?

314
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:39.250
Or are they just two dudes trying to retire on a pile of free vodka pizza rolls

315
00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:42.250
and deodorant? Let us know what you think in the comments special,
