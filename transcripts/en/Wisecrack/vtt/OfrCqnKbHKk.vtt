00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.910
<v 0>What's up guys, Helen here today. I want to talk about that weird feeling.</v>

2
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:11.550
I get in the pit of my stomach when Hulu feeds me.

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.200
<v 1>An ad like this bullying the me too movement against sexual harassment</v>

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.790
validity. That's right advertising, but make it work.

5
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.920
<v 0>Woke advertising has become an increasingly omnipresent phenomenon in our media</v>

6
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:27.890
landscape. It's not enough to sell a hamburger.

7
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.290
He got a sell a mental health revolution.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.300
Now I'm not saying I prefer the gross advertisements of yesteryear or even

9
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.660
any ads at all. However, if you're cynical like us,

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.110
you probably feel a little weird about your bath soap being imbued with

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.890
progressive new ideas about womanhood in the interest of maintaining a healthy

12
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:50.150
skepticism toward anyone who's ultimately trying to sell me more stuff I've been

13
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:50.984
wondering.

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.680
Why does every advertisement lately seem to come furnished with the political

15
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:57.380
message? And what does it mean for us?

16
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.540
Welcome to this wisecrack edition on how advertising got woke and

17
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.090
Hey, if you hate ads, Loker otherwise,

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.110
there's a way you can watch wisecrack videos without any brand asking you to do

19
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:13.610
anything by becoming a patron, you can watch all of our content ad free.

20
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.390
It also helps us keep making great in depth content like this video,

21
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.980
whether or not it's at friendly checkout, patrion.com/wisecrack,

22
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.660
or click right here to learn more.

23
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.980
We have to start by asking what exactly is a woke ad.

24
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.990
Is it the SpaghettiOs tweets about Pearl Harbor or is it more like when I Kia

25
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.870
decides to feature a gay couple back in 1994?

26
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.940
Or is it when Nike pays Colin Kaepernick to be a spokesperson precisely because

27
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:41.780
of his activism,

28
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.640
we'd argue that woke advertising is defined by its invocation of social causes

29
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.800
and social movements of a given moment,

30
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.300
especially those affiliated with progress and social change. So, sorry,

31
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:57.170
SpaghettiOs. We are not woke. That's not to say conservative brands.

32
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:00.140
Don't also try to capitalize on the politics of their consumers,

33
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.130
but nobody would call that one. Especially these days,

34
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.080
woke ads typically focus on identity based issues surrounding race, gender,

35
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.740
sexuality, disabilities, and so forth. In this way.

36
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.090
The Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad is woke because it intended to align itself with

37
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:21.440
black lives matter. It just failed hilariously. Under this definition,

38
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.930
the secret deodorant ad in the 1970s,

39
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.700
strong enough for a man made for a woman was probably somewhat woke for the

40
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:32.870
feminist movement at the time, but the same ethos in a Covergirl ad in 2020,

41
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.033
probably not.

42
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.450
There's also the question of whether say showing a female executive in an ad is

43
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.060
some woke affirmation of girl bosses, or just,

44
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.070
you know what professional life is like today.

45
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.620
Now a lot of you might be screaming.

46
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.620
All advertising is self-interested your big dumb,

47
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:52.850
dumb companies are just trying to sell stuff to as many people as possible,

48
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.000
regardless of skin color, sexual orientation or gender.

49
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.950
They're just getting with the times and targeting their accordingly.

50
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.890
Whether that's two dudes putting their relationship through the gauntlet of

51
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.510
building Ikea furniture together,

52
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.590
or just this guy who needs an energy drink for gamers or whoever needs this pink

53
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:11.260
gamer chair, but economic reasons aside.

54
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.260
What if it's just really bad versus advertisements like any form of

55
00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:20.160
visual or literary? Very storytelling have always been latent with values.

56
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.440
There are reflections of our culture.

57
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.860
And if our culture wants you to move to the burbs and raise a family,

58
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.390
that's what they're going to reflect.

59
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.590
Or if society wants you to get rich and hot add laws and reflect that,

60
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.380
but as values change ads naturally do too,

61
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.040
as a result and contrary to popular belief, well,

62
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.850
advertising is not at all a new phenomenon. It's pretty old.

63
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.070
Historically most woke advertising appeal to women overwhelmingly white by

64
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:49.740
reflecting various stages of the feminist movement.

65
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.780
As explained by Andy's Eisler author of we were feminist once in the late 19th

66
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:56.160
and early 20th century,

67
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.420
when some younger women were feeling stifled by Victorian notions of idealized

68
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:01.254
womanhood,

69
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.030
advertisers piggybacked off the existing feminist notion of the emancipated new

70
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:08.250
woman by frequently depicting young,

71
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.930
independent gals who bucked against Victoria norms and even served on juries.

72
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.190
The new woman was according to his, Eisler essentially a watered down,

73
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.270
more palatable suffragette who surprise like buying things,

74
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.040
this conflict between the advertiser friendly new woman and the ruckus raising

75
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:29.730
hunger striking suffragette is at the heart of the problem with woke

76
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:30.564
advertising.

77
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.440
And it is maybe best illustrated by the torches of freedom campaign,

78
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.130
which very publicly debut during a parade in 1929,

79
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.010
it was masterminded by one Edward Bernays,

80
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.430
the creator of modern public relations and Sigmund Freud's nephew.

81
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.030
Bernays believed that people bought things not based on what they needed,

82
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.000
but based on the feelings, a given commodity inspired.

83
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.440
So he organized a stunt to sell cigarettes to women who were typically looked

84
00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:57.690
down upon it. They smoked outside of their homes.

85
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.980
He paid a group of debutantes to light up during new York's Easter day parade

86
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.880
and made sure the event was both captured by the press and interpreted as a

87
00:05:05.881 --> 00:05:09.960
protest for women's rights. Cigarettes were no longer desperate men.

88
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.520
They were torches of freedom, symbolizing female emancipation fittingly.

89
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.760
The cigarette industry would adapt its ads for the next phase of women's

90
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.790
movement. 40 years later when Virginia Slims told women,

91
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.250
you have come a long way baby, as they sold them,

92
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:28.230
cancer sticks that 1968 tagline was in itself a response to a growing

93
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:29.700
threat for advertisers,

94
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.750
feminist no longer interested in traditional beauty standards, housework,

95
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:37.020
and so on might end up buying less lipstick and Clorox.

96
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.270
So some savvy brands like Charlie perfume made like advertisers of

97
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.680
yore and incorporated elements of the feminist movement depicting a liberated

98
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.090
bold woman who held down a job and look good while doing it without explicitly

99
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:54.630
using controversial feminist language. In all of these examples,

100
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.940
we can see one of the first dangers of woke.

101
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.170
It dilutes the political message of a movement,

102
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.490
women who were literally not allowed to apply for a credit card without a male

103
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:08.360
under signer were asked to redirect their attention to buying the feminist

104
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.840
perfume or the emancipatory cigarette. Why March at all,

105
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.940
when you can consume fittingly,

106
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.200
a similar phenomenon happened to black Americans before the civil rights

107
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:22.580
movement and the rise of the black middle-class in the 1950s advertising to

108
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:26.390
people of color was virtually non-existent. Advertisers had simply,

109
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:29.630
always targeted white Americans viewed in that framework.

110
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.980
Mainstream ads showing black people at all was at face value,

111
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.990
sadly kind of progressive some of the first companies to even advertise in black

112
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:42.650
run newspapers were you guessed it cigarette companies.

113
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.920
The reason they did it is pretty instructive internal humans for tobacco company

114
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:52.240
Brown and Williamson report that in the case of black Spanic communities,

115
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.250
the relatively small and often tightly knit minority community can work to be in

116
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.760
W's marketing advantage if exploited properly.

117
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.250
And just like with the feminist movement,

118
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.730
as the burgeoning civil rights movement made headway as began,

119
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:09.400
co-opting imagery associated with black power,

120
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.380
none more bluntly than this 1970 JC penny ad that reads SLAC power as

121
00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:16.450
historian Stewart. Eowyn put it at the time.

122
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.130
The advertising industry seeking markets has generated a mass culture,

123
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:25.000
which reflects the spirits, but not the cutting edge of this resistance.

124
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.650
But by the 1980s,

125
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.330
our contemporary brand of woke advertising was really coming into its own.

126
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.320
Again,

127
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.640
aimed primarily at white women in what [inaudible] calls empower timesing.

128
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.500
This was a time when consumer choices exploded and consumption became

129
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.390
elevated as a measure of liberation as cultural historian and media critic,

130
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.350
Susan J.

131
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.550
Douglas put it elite is a men narcissism merged in a perfect appeal to forget

132
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:54.310
the political already and get back to the personal,

133
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.360
which you might be able to do something about specifically by buying those

134
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.990
designer eyeglasses, you could change your small corner of the world.

135
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.070
Ads would continue to capitalize off of feminist critiques of mass consumer

136
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:09.790
culture as seen in this Nike ad campaign in the early nineties.

137
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.260
What's so interesting about this ad is the way it specifically invokes the pain

138
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:18.520
of women living in a world that judges them overwhelmingly by their appearance,

139
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.500
rather than being judged by curves.

140
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.480
It reads a woman should be judged by who she is and who she is trying to become.

141
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.140
This leads to another serious problem with woke advertising.

142
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.480
If all advertising sells dreams,

143
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.540
woke ads tend to sell the dream of respect and equality,

144
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.000
reading this ad stirs real emotions,

145
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.380
literally making Oprah cry on air ad, sell solutions,

146
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.250
whether it's for your leaky, whatever, or your untoned arms.

147
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.050
The solution Nike is selling in this case is the solution to sexism.

148
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.990
You're not buying a running shoe made in a sweat shop.

149
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.210
You're buying good quality and respect the guiding principle shopping,

150
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.830
but make it feminist.

151
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.060
It's also worth noting that the feminism of Nike was anything,

152
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:06.510
but as a coalition of women's groups said at the time,

153
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.290
while the women who wear Nike shoes in the United States are encouraged to

154
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:13.080
perform their personal best. The Indonesian,

155
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.970
Vietnamese and Chinese women making the shoes often suffer from inadequate

156
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.740
wages, corporal punishment,

157
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.970
forced overtime and or sexual harassment women.

158
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.270
Weren't the only group being targeted by woke advertising at the turn of the

159
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:28.104
century though,

160
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.490
the aforementioned Ikea ad was only the first of many active campaigns by

161
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.780
corporations to court.

162
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:38.310
So-called dollars as author Alexandra Chasen explains in her book,

163
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.110
selling out such courting of the market was said to signal an end to

164
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:43.950
homophobia.

165
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.090
This can most visibly be seen in the rise of everything rainbow in recent

166
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:52.680
decades, an effective co-opting of the rainbow flag designed by gay activists,

167
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.570
Gilbert Baker in the late seventies,

168
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.980
everything from rainbow underwear to rainbow Instagram images to rainbow

169
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:00.240
Chipotle burritos,

170
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.860
proport to celebrate queerness while really elevating the simple act of buying

171
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.600
walk is, and always will be extra as Jason puts it.

172
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:11.190
When describing rainbow clothes,

173
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.480
the reduction of politics to style implies that consumption can amount to

174
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:20.100
political change attempts to imbue advertising with woke messaging became

175
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:24.090
increasingly more explicit throughout the two thousands best exemplified by the

176
00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:27.390
ubiquity of this is what a feminist looks like, shirts,

177
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.230
which literalize the notion that buying the right thing signals your commitment

178
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.500
to the cause of women's rights. And in the past five years,

179
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.420
as feminism has become increasingly less taboo advertising that co-ops feminist

180
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:43.260
language has become all, but ubiquitous, that's not surprising.

181
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.250
Woke advertising generally supports the status quo with risk averse

182
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:48.030
corporations,

183
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.870
typically choosing to piggyback off of existing social change rather than

184
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:56.250
furthering it in this lens. It's no surprise that Beyonce is 2014.

185
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.300
Feminist VMAX moment was followed by an explosion of brands,

186
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.800
evoking feminism, queen bean made it safe and advertising followed.

187
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.580
What's really interesting about these ads is that they have nothing to do with

188
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:12.210
the product and everything to do with exploring the pain and oppression,

189
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.280
women and girls face dubbed,

190
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:17.940
hashtag [inaudible] for their purportedly feminist messaging.

191
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.270
These ads almost guaranteed to tug at the heartstrings.

192
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.140
This is already a reason to be wary. Remember Edward Bernays,

193
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.860
it's not about the product. It's about the way the product makes you feel.

194
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.940
And if these sanitary napkins make you feel sad for the way your twelve-year-old

195
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:33.990
self was pigeonholed,

196
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.010
you're more likely to buy them perhaps after seeing the rampant success of

197
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.170
[inaudible] corporations have in recent years become to explicitly draw on black

198
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:45.300
activism for inspiration,

199
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.160
a Procter and gamble ad from 2017 show several black parents talking to their

200
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:53.100
children about the racism they will inevitably encounter.

201
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.180
It concludes by imagining a world where such conversations are not necessary as

202
00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:59.140
with women's ads.

203
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.140
These ads draw on real pain while offering wish fulfillment by imagining a lest

204
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:06.730
racist future sound, a little manipulative,

205
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.380
never is this more apparent than in that widely panned Pepsi ad in which Kendall

206
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:15.400
Jenner dissolves tensions between the police and protestors with a can of soda.

207
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:20.260
Ironically, this ad functions like a much less subtle version of 1970 ones.

208
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.360
I'd like to buy the world of Coke, Erin,

209
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:25.240
in the midst of the Vietnam war and massive social upheaval.

210
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.200
It simply implied that if everyone chilled out with a carbonated beverage Wars

211
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:30.370
and stuff wouldn't happen.

212
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.330
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

213
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.020
<v 0>It went on to receive countless accolades, inspired fan mail,</v>

214
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.230
and as a song, even charted in several countries.

215
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.030
But the Jenner Pepsi ad somehow crossed a threshold of believability by making

216
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.230
all too obvious.

217
00:12:49.231 --> 00:12:54.060
The implication that a Pepsi could end racism on the other hand,

218
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.110
brands are also eager to exploit the credibility earned by activists to steal

219
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:58.944
more stuff.

220
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.700
Advertisers today are dealing with similar issues that they faced from social

221
00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:05.580
issues of the last century, but maybe a little more.

222
00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:10.110
So millennial and gen Z consumers overwhelmingly say that they prefer to buy

223
00:13:10.111 --> 00:13:14.310
from brands that share their values or have a higher purpose. That is,

224
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.690
we want to know that our coffee is helping some farmer in Nicaragua,

225
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.150
send their kids to school or that our beans do or don't support the right

226
00:13:21.151 --> 00:13:25.770
presidential candidate. But there's another force pushing this change today.

227
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.100
Products are increasingly disappearing from advertisements,

228
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.460
which instead promote the more nebulous brand scholar.

229
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.690
Nikki Lisa Cole ties this transformation to the increased outsourcing of

230
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:37.524
production.

231
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.640
Leaving corporations progressively more detached from the actual products they

232
00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:43.170
made as Cole puts it.

233
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.970
Companies used to stand on a product that was your name, the product you made,

234
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.370
but when you don't actually make the product,

235
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.500
you have to come up with something else to sell to people.

236
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.520
That thing of course is a brand. And in many cases,

237
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.670
a hashtag woke brand as a result,

238
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.950
brands are doing another new thing.

239
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.330
Something we've mentioned in previous videos, they're becoming people,

240
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.500
woke people. The rise of social media has enabled a host of new,

241
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.790
usually painful ways for brands to interact with potential consumers and

242
00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:18.090
interact. They do, especially if it means making themselves look,

243
00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:22.110
noble brands increasingly are placing themselves at the center of flashpoint

244
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:23.100
cultural issues.

245
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.000
A Bloomberg analysis found that within three weeks of the murder of George

246
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.120
Floyd,

247
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.590
76 of the world's top 100 brands had posted at least one corporate statement

248
00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:32.880
about racial justice.

249
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.410
In this Instagram post FISA managed to incorporate two phrases iconic to its

250
00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:38.244
advertising,

251
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.720
turning it slogan everywhere you want to be into where we want to be and

252
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.890
slightly including part of their messaging excepted everywhere. Meanwhile,

253
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:47.520
Zahra,

254
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.890
the fast fashion company made infamous in 2016 for profiting of child labor

255
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.730
posted a black square that mostly yielded inpatient comments from customers

256
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.140
complaining about late shipping.

257
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.390
This queasy moment encapsulates the uneasy relationship between commerce and

258
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:03.560
social justice.

259
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.360
While some saw the quote unquote blackout as great for PR many criticized it as

260
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:12.710
co-opting a campaign conceived by black musicians and activists who were drowned

261
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:16.490
out amid a sea of corporate sponsored and performative black squares.

262
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.680
When the CEO of JP Morgan chase took a knee to invoke Colin Kaepernick diversity

263
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:22.221
consultant,

264
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:26.270
why Von Hutchinson responded by telling the Washington post that there's a lot

265
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:30.980
of performative allyship going round. Nobody's asking for a CEO to take a knee.

266
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.970
You take the knee after you change your policies. And of course,

267
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.020
as with feminism,

268
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.860
it's not a coincidence that this outpouring of corporate support comes at a time

269
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:43.820
when calls and support for ending police brutality is at an all-time high.

270
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.420
In other words, those support black lives matter when it's least controversial,

271
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.390
most convenient and financially safe to do so,

272
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.760
which is why I want to tell you right here.

273
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:57.470
And now that wisecrack is committed to ensuring all women can apply for and use

274
00:15:57.471 --> 00:15:59.690
credit cards without male supervision.

275
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.400
And you can take a stand right now with us by taking your credit card and using

276
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:05.450
it to become a patron.

277
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.470
Not only will you send a strong message to sexist credit card companies,

278
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:14.300
but you'll get ad free and early access to all of our videos plus higher levels.

279
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:16.820
Get you access to cool stuff like the wisecrack discord,

280
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.280
where you can hang out with wisecrack staff and fans,

281
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.910
be sure to let everyone know in there how much you support my right to

282
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:26.270
incessantly order takeout. Even when I have a fully stocked fridge,

283
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.580
check it out and make us stand by going to patrion.com/wisecrack and

284
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.580
as always, thanks for watching peace.

285
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:54.700
