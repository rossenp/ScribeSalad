00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>This episode is brought to you by Ridge wallet.</v>

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.290
What's up wisecrack Michael here.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.070
Welcome to the first episode of our new series book versus film,

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.490
where we'll size up the differences between our favorite films and shows and the

5
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:18.740
novels mangoes in comics they're adapted from,

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.390
I guess it should be called film slash television show versus novel slash comics

7
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.520
slash other source material. But well,

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.320
whatever and rest assured this ain't no listicle and classic wisecrack fashion.

9
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.130
We'll ask the eternal question. What does it all mean? Our first case study,

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.990
Chuck politics, 1996, novel fight club and its transformation into the 1999.

11
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:41.600
David Fincher film of the same name on the surface.

12
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:46.220
The movie seems like a near carbon copy of the book with a few minor details

13
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:46.970
changed.

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.020
But what if those minor details actually changed the message of the film let's

15
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:54.290
find out and obviously spoilers ahead for the book and novel.

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.513
<v 1>Oh.</v>

17
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.260
<v 0>For starters, let's see what the film and novel have in common.</v>

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.500
The basic story beats are pretty much the same in both.

19
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:10.220
We open on a guy with a gun in his mouth before jumping back to the events that

20
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:11.180
brought him there, uh,

21
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.480
faking it at a cancer support group with another phony named Marla meeting,

22
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.540
a guy named Tyler Durden who convinces them to start a fight club,

23
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.560
that fight club escalating into a terrorist faction called project man.

24
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.760
And the big surprise reveal. Tyler is the narrator's alter ego.

25
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.940
We end back at the beginning, the narrator with the gun in his mouth,

26
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.810
killing off Tyler Durden. So basically the same story, right?

27
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.980
Even some of the most memorable speeches in the film are taking practically word

28
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:38.570
for word from the novel.

29
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.510
<v 2>When you buy furniture, tell yourself that's it.</v>

30
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.290
That's the last sofa going to need? Whatever else happens. Got that.

31
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.460
So problem handling.

32
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.840
<v 0>Don't call the film a carbon copy just yet. Let's take a look at the minor,</v>

33
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:55.430
but meaningful differences between the two. Now, before we compare and contrast,

34
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:58.400
I want to give a shout out to someone who helps us keep the studio lights on

35
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.470
this week's sponsor. The Ridge wallet.

36
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.860
The holidays are coming up and a wallet gift is so underrated.

37
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.190
Most people are probably still walking around with their old lumpy leather

38
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.430
wallets from the eighties, but the Ridge wallet is an awesome upgrade.

39
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.290
It's light, sleek, industrial,

40
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.710
and it doesn't fold awkwardly in your pocket with such a minimalist design.

41
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.770
You might think you're sacrificing room for everything you carry,

42
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.100
but the Ridge can hold up to 12 cards and still has room for cash.

43
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.880
They're made of durable materials and come with RFID blocking technology to stop

44
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.090
digital pickpockets. The best part is that they come with a lifetime warranty.

45
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.200
So this may be the last wallet ever by the rich team is so confident that you

46
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:36.500
will love it, that you can try it out for 45 days and get a full refund.

49
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.690
Now back to the show difference. Number one, this line,

50
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.250
as it turns out a lot of the criticisms of the movie justified or not can be

51
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:53.900
understood through this line.

52
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.970
<v 1>Uh, Tyson has, is chasing cars and clothes working jobs we hate so we can buy.</v>

53
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.460
We don't need.

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.910
<v 0>Now before you fight club stance, throw your books at me and protest. Yes.</v>

55
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.710
This line is taken from a very similar one in the novel, but strangely enough,

56
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.470
in the book it said by one of Tyler's henchman the mechanic.

57
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.500
So what impact does this difference? Make well,

58
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.720
director David Fincher spelled it out in an interview,

59
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.710
explaining that the real act of sedition would be to spend a ton of money on a

60
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.070
film and to put movie stars in it and get people to go and talk about the

61
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.620
anti-consumer his rantings of a schizophrenia madman.

62
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.690
Having Brad Pitt a bonafide.

63
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.640
A-listers give these anti-consumer his speeches legitimizes the arguments and

64
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.970
it worked. People still emulate Tyler to this day.

65
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.170
If you search Tyler Durden jacket on Amazon, well, you can take your pick.

66
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.400
That's not the only difference to make sure people invested in Tyler and his

67
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:49.210
message, the film softened, many of his rougher edges, for instance,

68
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.890
and then novel Tyler eventually becomes homicidal killing the narrator's bus and

69
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:57.880
the mayor's special Envoy on recycling. Let's uh,

70
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.180
go to the book and see about this one. Marla yells,

71
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.710
you shot the mayor special Envoy on recycling. Tyler shot the mayor,

72
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.930
special Envoy on whatever. However,

73
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:12.010
the film goes out of its way to show that Tyler has no intention of harming

74
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.530
anyone not killing anyone, man was setting them free.

75
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.650
So there's the whole blowing up the credit card buildings thing.

76
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.280
But movie Tyler makes a point that the buildings are empty.

77
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.460
And even when he threatens a convenience store clerk at gunpoint,

78
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.690
it's revealed the gun has no bullets getting rid of Tyler's darker

79
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:31.930
characteristics makes his ideology all the more enticing.

80
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.170
It's easy to dismiss the words of a homicidal madman,

81
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.610
but it's much harder to do so if that person technically isn't hurting anyone.

82
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.990
So clearly Tyler Durden takes on vastly different meanings as a character when

83
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:45.880
you compare the film to the novel,

84
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.600
but that's not all difference to the meeting.

85
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.680
The way the narrator first meets Tyler is also dramatically different in the

86
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:54.700
film here.

87
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.880
The narrator first encountered Tyler on an airplane during a business trip,

88
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.990
but in the novel he meets his other half while he's lounging on a new Veatch.

89
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.150
Why this change? See,

90
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.360
there are two facets to the narrator and Tyler's relationship,

91
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.200
the mentor mentee aspect, and the more carnal side,

92
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.910
the books meet cute is pretty homoerotic. The films, airplanes, you know,

93
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.310
ever primarily presents Tyler as a mentor,

94
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.550
introducing the narrator to unsettling new ideas.

95
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.410
<v 3>You know why they put oxygen mask foam planes so they can breathe.</v>

96
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.930
Oxygen gets you high in a catastrophic emergency.

97
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:35.490
You're taking giant panic breaths. Suddenly you become euphoric docile.

98
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.773
You accepted.

99
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.480
<v 0>This speech mirrors, the narrator's status quo.</v>

100
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.990
He's a corporate drone moving through life without any agency,

101
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.750
just like the people on the plane he's accepted his fate.

102
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.910
He will work his dead-end nine to five job in perpetuity. Tyler, however,

103
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.100
jolts the narrator out of this comfort zone.

104
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 3>How's it working out for you? What being clever. This is the central tenant.</v>

105
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.270
<v 0>To their dynamic in the film and mentorship where Tyler forces the narrator to</v>

106
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:06.710
examine his life choices and break free from his self-imposed shackles. However,

107
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:11.570
in the novel, when the narrator first meets Tyler he's buck naked in the sand,

108
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.190
and what's the very first thing the narrator notices about Tyler, his body,

109
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.100
how I met Tyler was I went to a nude beach.

110
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.730
Tyler was naked and sweating gritty with sand,

111
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:26.540
his hair wet and stringy hanging in his face.

112
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.970
Just one second now, to be fair,

113
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.780
the film definitely plays into their homoeroticism with bath breaks,

114
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:36.800
petty jealousies, and all,

115
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.430
but it also blurs the line between the narrator's jealousy of Tyler's

116
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:44.750
hyper-masculinity and his straight-up sexual desire for the guy in

117
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:47.390
contrast the novel by having the meet at the beach,

118
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.180
really centers the plot on the whole. I want to be,

119
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:52.370
and maybe want to bang this man thing,

120
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.880
but it's not just the central relationship with the story that changed,

121
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.540
which brings us to Marla difference. Number three,

122
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.820
Marla's backstory the film explicitly frames Marla as an unfulfilled

123
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.530
object of the narrator's desire.

124
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.090
And also is this kind of mirror image just as he fakes having diseases to get a

125
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.660
good cry. So does Marla and this infuriates him.

126
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.630
<v 4>You liar, you big tourist. I need this.</v>

127
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.180
<v 0>But this paired down version of Marla necessarily excise as much of her</v>

128
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:23.014
backstory.

129
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.860
And this in turn makes her a far less sympathetic character than she is in the

130
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:27.640
novel.

131
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.790
And the film Marla doesn't really have a reason to go to the cancer support.

132
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.860
When asked about it, she simply says.

133
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.020
<v 4>It's cheaper than I'm moving this free coffee.</v>

134
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.360
<v 0>But in the novel Marla tells the narrator that she goes to these groups to feel</v>

135
00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:43.390
more alive. Let's go to the book to check this one out.

136
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.660
All her life Marlin never saw a dead person.

137
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.500
There was no real sense of life because she had nothing to contrast it with.

138
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.810
Now that she knows where we're all going. Marlin feels every moment of her life.

139
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.250
Later on in the film, Marla asked the narrator to check her breast for lumps.

140
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.050
<v 4>I need you to check and see if there's a lump at night.</v>

141
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.340
<v 0>The narrator checks doesn't feel any lumps and then immediately asked to leave.</v>

142
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.330
However, in the novel, the narrator actually does feel a lump. And what's more,

143
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.810
this isn't the first time it's happened to Marla turns out her first breast

144
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:16.900
cancer scare is what prompted her to go to the support groups in the first

145
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:21.730
place. So yes, the narrator's description of Marla is identical. And the film.

146
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.390
<v 4>Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.</v>

147
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.300
The tragedy she said was that she didn't.

148
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.920
<v 0>But it takes on an entirely different context in each version in the film,</v>

149
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:34.930
the line comes across as a little edge. Laurie,

150
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.960
even ironic since Marla isn't sick. However,

151
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:40.300
in the book it's a tragic declaration.

152
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.020
Marla might actually be dying and she goes to a clinic to see,

153
00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:48.040
but leaves after deciding. She'd rather not know if she is dying.

154
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:51.190
She doesn't want her life to end in a drawn out process of being stuck in a

155
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:53.710
hospital. But her tragedy is that she won't die.

156
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:57.990
Unexpectedly saving her from the prolonged ritual of dying from cancer or

157
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:01.110
anything else as a result, everything Marla does,

158
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.030
including her suicide attempt has extra weight in the novel, but in the film,

159
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.140
Marla becomes merely a goal for the narrator and it means to expose his own

160
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:13.350
self-loathing. He believes that if he can become more of a man,

161
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:17.910
he will be deserving for affection. This isn't a mutual reciprocated love store.

162
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.320
It's all one side within a masculine man puffing up his own ego so that he can

163
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.480
be macho enough to ask a girl out.

164
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.900
So basically Marla gets a short shaft,

165
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.170
different number for the credit card building,

166
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.980
but we haven't dealt with arguably the most action packed part of the story,

167
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.480
the whole terrorist term. Now in the film, Tyler plans to blow up buildings,

168
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:43.680
housing, credit card companies in the novel, he has a very different target.

169
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.250
Why is this interesting? Because it further changes how we view him.

170
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.000
And the film Tyler's plan is to destroy any records housed by credit card

171
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:53.490
companies, giving everyone a clean slate.

172
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.420
<v 5>Out these windows. We will view the collapse of financial,</v>

173
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.020
this one step closer to economic equilibrium.

174
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.921
<v 0>However,</v>

175
00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:05.810
in the novel he's far more self-motivated viewing himself as a messianic figure.

176
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.050
His ultimate plan isn't to destroy a bunch of credit card companies.

177
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.260
Instead he wants to blow up the tallest skyscraper,

178
00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:14.150
which will topple onto a national museum,

179
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.820
taking himself out in the explosion as a murder,

180
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.780
his ultimate goal to prop himself up as a legend and become immortal. Well,

181
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:24.800
let's check this part out in the book. This isn't really death.

182
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.410
We will be legend. We won't grow old.

183
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.120
Whereas Tyler's plan in the novel is presented as purely self-aggrandizing

184
00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:35.330
destruction. The film as a selfless political angle,

185
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.270
something that audiences would in fact, even root for.

186
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.190
This was very much intentional as producer Ross, Grayson bell recalled. I said,

187
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.970
what if they blow up the credit card companies and everybody woke up one day and

188
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:48.800
they didn't have to pay their bills.

189
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.520
We needed something where the audience members would cheer the destruction of

190
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:53.354
the world.

191
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.140
The film ends with bombs exploding as Marla and the narrator watch holding

192
00:10:57.141 --> 00:11:01.550
hands. Even if we know on some level that Tyler dying is justice served.

193
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.670
We can't help, but sympathize with him and his cause at least a little bit.

194
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.760
However, in the novel, the bombs never go off.

195
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.400
Tyler's plans are thwarted by his own incompetence.

196
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.200
And this kind of makes them the punchline, not the hero, nothing explodes.

197
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.220
I say, Tyler,

198
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.690
you mixed the nitro with parafin didn't you parafin never works

199
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:21.470
here.

200
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.730
Tyler's failure serves as a reputation of everything he's espoused and stood for

201
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.780
this change effects.

202
00:11:26.781 --> 00:11:29.870
How the audience ultimately views the character in the novel.

203
00:11:29.871 --> 00:11:34.310
We laugh at Tyler yet in the film, we cheer him the difference. Number five,

204
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.020
the last ending. Okay?

205
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:39.200
So the movie ends of buildings collapsing in a pixie soundtrack,

206
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.240
but after Tyler's failure, the book keeps going. And this is really important.

207
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.920
After the bomb malfunctions,

208
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.400
there's an added code where the narrator wakes up and what he believes is

209
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:51.830
heaven, but is actually a psych ward.

210
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.760
So why does film end on an uplifting note?

211
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.280
Whereas the novel ends with him arguing with a psychologist.

212
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:01.330
He mistakenly believes is God it's because they're not going for the same theme.

213
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.320
The film focuses on a man discovering his confidence and reasserting his

214
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:08.920
manhood. Whereas the book stresses a man rebelling against his father,

215
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.950
both in the paternal and religious sense.

216
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.470
This is why the film ends on a triumphant note.

217
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.100
Since the narrator owns his masculinity and triumphs over Tyler,

218
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.200
he wins Marla's affections. However,

219
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:24.370
the book's ending reflects a far more ambiguous message. According to writer,

220
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:25.204
Chuck Palahniuk.

221
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.600
The central message of fight club was always about the empowerment of the

222
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:32.770
individual through small escalating challenges in a way it's like everyone

223
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:36.910
rebelling against dad and discovering their own power by killing the father.

224
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.050
As the Buddhist would say,

225
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.650
eventually you have to kill your father and kill your teacher.

226
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.130
The film touches upon this, kill your father theme in a moment,

227
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:48.760
adapted from the novel as the narrator and Tyler discuss who they wish they

228
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:51.010
could fight. Most Tyler reveals.

229
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:53.260
He wants to beat up the father who abandoned him.

230
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.200
<v 6>I'm a dad. I don't know my dad. I mean, I know him,</v>

231
00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:01.710
but he left when I was like six years old, married,

232
00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:03.540
this other woman had other kids.

233
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.250
<v 0>Both the novel and the film then extend this absentee father figure into a</v>

234
00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:12.330
metaphor for God himself, just as fathers abandoned their unwanted children.

235
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.640
God has abandoned this world.

236
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.960
This sentiment is expressed in nearly identical lines, said by Tyler,

237
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.090
in the film and the mechanic in the book.

238
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.560
<v 1>Those were models for God. If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about?</v>

239
00:13:25.561 --> 00:13:28.050
God, listen to me.

240
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.780
I have to consider the possibility that God does not like you never wanted you

241
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.740
in all probability. He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen.

242
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.960
<v 0>However, the novel takes this one step further than the film.</v>

243
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.450
When Tyler is first introduced on the beach,

244
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.720
he uses logs of wood to build a makeshift hand in the sand.

245
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.980
Also that for one moment, he can sit within the hand of his creation,

246
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.480
Tyler shrugged and showed me how the five standing logs were wider at the base.

247
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.170
What Tyler had created was the shadow of a giant hand.

248
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.330
The giant shadow hand was perfect for one minute. And for one perfect minute,

249
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.770
Tyler had sat in the Palm of, for perfection. He'd created himself.

250
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.150
In this instance, Tyler has forsaken God and become his own creator.

251
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.390
This moment for shadows, the creation of fight club and project man,

252
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.040
and which Tyler and the narrator become gods or fathers to their followers,

253
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.740
to everybody there I am. Tyler Durden,

254
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:29.250
the great and powerful God and father.

255
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.310
And just as the narrator's father abandoned him.

256
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.820
He too ultimately does the same thing to his own children,

257
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.900
turning against the space monkeys and trying to tackle their terrorist regime.

258
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:44.010
But it's not quite that simple in the novels Coda it's revealed that many of the

259
00:14:44.011 --> 00:14:47.970
orderlies in the psych ward are actually members of project, man,

260
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.980
waiting for Tyler to return. Cause every once in awhile,

261
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.910
somebody brings me my lunch tray in my meds and he has a black guy or his

262
00:14:55.911 --> 00:15:00.410
forehead is swollen with stitches. And he says, we miss you, Mr. Durden,

263
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.140
the end of politics novel. Unlike the film,

264
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.310
isn't a perfect triumph or the narrator. He's still stuck in his own delusions,

265
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.530
surrounded by his unwanted children.

266
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.180
And ironically he's become the very thing he was rebelling against in the first

267
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:18.980
place an absentee father. But what do you think wisecrack space monkeys.

268
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.410
Do you have a preferred version of fight club?

269
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.450
