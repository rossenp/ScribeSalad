00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.060
<v 0>Hey everyone, Michael here,</v>

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.630
have you paid even the slightest bit of attention to weird things,

3
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.370
your uncle post on Facebook,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.130
you might've noticed a hip boogeyman in the conspiracy theory world, bill Gates,

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.300
the Microsoft founder,

6
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.660
and second richest person alive has joined the ranks of the Rockefeller family,

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.400
George Soros, the Bilderberg group,

8
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.740
and the Illuminati on the list of shadowy figures.

9
00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:27.710
People would like to blame their problems on and as it currently concerns

10
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.950
William Henry Gates. The third, that problem is COVID 19.

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.430
Now theories about Gates involvement in the Corona virus pandemic come in,

12
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.400
all shapes and sizes ranging from so bizarre.

13
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.700
We can't even trace their connection to reality, to actual facts,

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.750
grossly distorted,

15
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:46.610
to seem scarier rumors include bill Gates owns the patent for SARS cov to the

16
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.160
virus that causes COVID-19. He does not.

17
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.060
Bill Gates will use a forthcoming vaccine, do secretly implant microchips in us.

18
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.013
He won't.

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.620
And bill Gates is trying to build a global surveillance state as foretold in the

20
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.940
biblical book of revelation, also false, but in a much more complicated way.

21
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.180
But what I find interesting about the people behind these theories,

22
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.730
those who posit a shadowy nefarious character,

23
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.550
that secretly controls the world with their wealth and influence.

24
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.730
It's how they often overlook the real and scary truth.

25
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:14.870
That's out in broad daylight.

26
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.990
And the theory swirling around bill Gates are no exception.

27
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.530
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on the truth about bill Gates.

28
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.820

to hear more now to preempt a lot of angry comments.

36
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.220
Bill Gates is not only currently the second richest man on earth.

37
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.550
He's also one of the single most generous people on the planet in terms of the

38
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:55.610
total money given away over the last 25 years, bill and his wife,

39
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:58.610
Melinda have given over $50 billion to charity,

40
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.430
much of it through the eponymous bill and Melinda Gates foundation.

41
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.900
What's more Gates has pledged to donate the majority of his $100 billion estate.

42
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.920
And upon his death,

43
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.610
his three children will each receive a $10 million inheritance totaling,

44
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:15.080
approximately one 33rd of 1% of his total net worth for

45
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:15.680
scale.

46
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.880
That's like if your parents had a million dollars and left you 300 bucks to

47
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:23.570
understand how conspiracy theories often distract us from the very public,

48
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:26.360
not at all secret bullets, powerful people.

49
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.670
Let's take a look at one of the most prominent bill Gates,

50
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:32.510
conspiracy theories that he is somehow going to make the entire human population

51
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:33.860
get the Corona virus vaccine,

52
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.180
a disease he purportedly invented in order to microchip us all for again,

53
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.120
some vague plot to track our walks of shame to the waffle house.

54
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.660
This theory falls into the category of cherry picking a few facts to tell a

55
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:47.300
narrative with only the loosest relationship to reality.

56
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.390
And that reality is a thing called ID 2020.

57
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.320
ID 2020 is a nonprofit organization loosely affiliated with the bill Gates

58
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:55.430
extended universe.

59
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.610
While the organization doesn't list the Gates foundation as a partner,

60
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.190
it does list Microsoft,

61
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.550
a company that Gates only recently resigned from the board of and Gavi,

62
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.540
a vaccine advocacy organization that received substantial funding from the Gates

63
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.330
foundation ID 2020. His pitch is pretty simple.

64
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.350
A legal identity is increasingly a gateway to participate in the modern world.

65
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.280
And lots of people can't actually identify themselves if you're homeless in

66
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:18.731
America.

67
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.330
And can't prove who you are with a driver's license or social security card,

68
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.920
getting a job social services, or just participating in society is complicated.

69
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.450
If you're living on skid row,

70
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.290
holding on to identification in the face of rainstorms police seizures and theft

71
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:36.760
is just really hard. Now imagine those same problems, but faced by refugees,

72
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:39.250
looking for healthcare or people in the developing world,

73
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.110
looking to get a small business loan ID.

74
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:44.230
2020 wants to fix that with a digital identity system.

75
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.110
<v 1>It's on the cloud. Now.</v>

76
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.950
<v 0>Even though bill Gates is not seeming to be directly involved with ID 2020,</v>

77
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.980
he has addressed similar issues surrounding identification,

78
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.250
and here's where the theory start. As it turns out,

79
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.220
the medical records are super important. A constant problem.

80
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:03.520
Healthcare workers face than developing world is wondering for instance,

81
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.241
who has,

82
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:08.170
and hasn't been inoculated against polio or measles and the Gates foundation,

83
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:11.140
since it would like to stop children from dying and preventable diseases,

84
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.960
partially funded research into an infrared tattoo,

85
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.950
a quantum dot that could provide a medical record that can't get destroyed in a

86
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.540
flood or lost under a floorboard.

87
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.320
People living in the developed world might take for granted how important

88
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:24.400
medical records are,

89
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.910
but every time a doctor makes sure you're unscheduled for your shots or check

90
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.110
your own allergies, they need reliable medical records, quantum dot tattoos,

91
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.770
or otherwise it's fair to suppose that Gates believes identification is a key

92
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:37.600
hurdle in giving people medical care,

93
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.080
but you can probably already see how this quickly turns into fodder for

94
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:45.460
conspiracy theorist ID 2020 quantum dots and vaccines got amalgamated into a

95
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:48.970
scary theory about how Gates was trying to microchip and track people and some

96
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.240
expansive global surveillance system to be perfectly clear.

97
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.870
Bill Gates is not demonically marking. People are calling the population,

98
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.850
but here's the troubling thing.

99
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.080
Plenty of what he actually does funds and believes is ethically debatable at

100
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.360
best and downright harmful at worst.

101
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.490
And this is what makes the conspiracy theories about him.

102
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:10.060
So frustrating to figure out why I want to talk to you about disease

103
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:13.930
eradication. If you watch the decoding bill Gates documentary on Netflix,

104
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.050
you might've learned about how the man has committed to valiantly defeating.

105
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.440
<v 1>Polio and malaria. You know, this was this big,</v>

106
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.190
risky thing we were doing to help lead polio eradication.

107
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.530
<v 0>Just a quick definition before we move on to.</v>

108
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.550
<v 1>Eradicate a disease means to bring cases of the disease to zero everywhere</v>

109
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.570
forever. Meaning.

110
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.040
<v 0>Unlike Mel Gibson's career, it's never coming back. Smallpox for instance,</v>

111
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:38.880
was declared eradicated in 1980 after a global vaccination campaign.

112
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.130
And while there's a few lab samples left,

113
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.850
hasn't been naturally transmitted since then. There's malaria and polio.

114
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.500
These diseases suck. Malaria kills hundreds of thousands of people a year.

115
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:51.420
And before a global campaign against polio,

116
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:55.140
hundreds of thousands of people were left paralyzed from the virus. And here,

117
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:59.330
I want to say that I personally believe that a bill Gates is a smart man who

118
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.160
genuinely believes he's helping the world and B he might nevertheless be hurting

119
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.260
science and global health policy to show.

120
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.600
I want to introduce you to Dr. Errata coaching,

121
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.890
who was pretty much the Bobby Knight of public health coachee by all accounts is

122
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.620
kind of a Dick, but he's a Dick with a good track record.

123
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.760
He ran an extremely successful campaign against tuberculosis for the who before

124
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:22.430
leading their charge against malaria. In 2006,

125
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.940
coachee had a pension for firing people as well as angry and pharmaceutical

126
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:27.800
companies and the nonprofits he worked for,

127
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.920
obviously among those nonprofits was the Gates foundation,

128
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.400
which had made malaria eradication a priority in 2007.

129
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.480
Now Earl radicating malaria is a really hard stopping smallpox,

130
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.770
still no small feat.

131
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:43.250
Was it at least easier because the virus can only be spread by humans.

132
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.790
So to track down every last case, you only need to track down people.

133
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.790
The parasite that causes malaria is a little harder to track.

134
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.670
It's been part of its life in mosquitoes and part of it in humans.

135
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.350
So when the Gates foundation announced,

136
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:56.780
they were going to funnel money into eradicating malaria,

137
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:58.940
that is wiping it off the face of the earth.

138
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.610
Most public health experts thought it was a bad idea.

139
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.940
It was neither feasible nor safe as Sonia Shaw writes in her book,

140
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.460
pandemic rather experts, including cocci.

141
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.310
He felt that containing the disease was a better use of resources.

142
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.180
In other words, we could spend the money on drugs, mosquito nets, insecticides,

143
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:18.200
and other measures to drastically reduce cases rather than expending endless

144
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.850
resources, trying to bring them to zero.

145
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.020
I missed the call from malaria eradication coachee in a memo leaked to the New

146
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.500
York times,

147
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.370
complained to his boss that the Gates foundation was having a corrosive effect

148
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:29.690
on the scientific process.

149
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.170
He warned that the influence of the foundation on global health policy had

150
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.610
dangerous consequences on the policy-making process and world health and accused

151
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:40.760
the foundation of only promoting policies that have been researched by its own

152
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:42.530
grantees. In one case,

153
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.190
cocci accused the Gates foundation of pushing a potentially dangerous malaria

154
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:50.420
drug, a policy that just so happened to be funded by their own research dollars.

155
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.710
Dr. Cocci wrote,

156
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.800
although it was less and less straightforward that the health agency should

157
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:55.520
recommend it.

158
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.970
The agency's objections were met with intense and aggressive opposition from

159
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:00.800
Gates back scientists and the foundation,

160
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.090
the who he wrote needs to stand up to such pressures and ensure that the review

161
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:09.310
of evidence it a rigorously independent invested interest did not happen.

162
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.720
Instead. The who adopted the Gates back to plan another health expert.

163
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.530
I'm your Otter.

164
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.950
Ron said his experience with Gates finance policy groups convinced him they were

165
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:19.930
engaged in stomach churning group thing.

166
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.010
And what happened to coachee for speaking out about Gates as shy rights he was

167
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:27.130
put on gardening leave, never to be heard from again.

168
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.370
And this is the nonsense all secret truth about bill Gates.

169
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.030
He's not a secret dictator with a shadowy agenda. Instead,

170
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.080
he's a very rich person who can throw his money around to have his voice heard

171
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.430
those contributions to the who he's also buying influence over their policies.

172
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.680
He's no different in that way. From Michael Bloomberg,

173
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.340
who in his bid for New York city mayor famously made charitable donations to

174
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:50.320
groups that were critical of him to shut them up,

175
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.800
or the Koch brothers who have spent millions of dollars advancing their pet

176
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:56.130
political causes or George Soros who has done.

177
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 1>Similarly on the opposite side of the political spectrum,</v>

178
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.070
you might look at the aims of Soros or Gates and call them laudable.

179
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.930
And often many of them are,

180
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.740
but a world where a select few decide what's good for the rest of the world,

181
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.880
basically amounts to a benevolent oligarchy. And it's not a shadowy cabal.

182
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.400
It's just kind of how modern philanthropy works.

183
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.660
A ton of non-profit activity nowadays is directed in some part by grants,

184
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:22.710
from huge organizations like the Rockefeller foundation, the Gates foundation,

185
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.880
the Koch foundation,

186
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:28.020
and also corporate donors looking for good PR companies like MasterCard or

187
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.890
Starbucks are more than eager to shell out millions of dollars to charitable

188
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.430
causes. And Hey, what's wrong with doing a good deed?

189
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.690
The problem like we saw with malaria is that money often has implicit or

190
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:41.010
explicit strings attached.

191
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.580
The countless health researchers funded by the Gates foundation might for

192
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:45.120
instance,

193
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.300
feel less inclined to criticize the foundation's policies or its corporate

194
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:51.090
benefactors as sociologists Lindsay McGaughey notes.

195
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.990
The fact that the Gates is often funded initiatives that many people approve of

196
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:58.830
should not insulate them from criticism and to date that's exactly what has

197
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.510
happened. Gaping silence,

198
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.080
the autocratic influence on the who is just one example.

199
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.590
We could also consider what it means for global health policy to enforce this

200
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.510
top down model, consider Gates mission to eradicate polio a seriously cool idea.

201
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.650
But the thing is polio has already been combated so well that it doesn't even

202
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:18.240
hit the top 10 list of things.

203
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.480
People in rural villages are worried about killing them. Donald Henderson,

204
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:21.931
who led the,

205
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:26.400
who successful effort to eradicate smallpox is noted that polio vaccines have

206
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:30.180
come at the expense of other more urgent vaccinations, Henderson accounts,

207
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:32.010
interactions with villagers who questioned,

208
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:35.760
why they're being inoculated for polio instead of the much more urgent and

209
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:37.320
deadly problem of measles.

210
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.600
So is bill Gates doing apparently noble things in all the wrong ways, maybe,

211
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.620
but his undue influence hasn't merely refocused public health priorities at the

212
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:50.700
highest level. It's also led to a lot of other far shadier policies.

213
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.470
James Love the director of knowledge,

214
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:56.250
ecology international argues that Gates uses his philanthropy to push a

215
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:58.710
pro-patent agenda for pharmaceutical drugs,

216
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.680
even in countries that are too poor to afford many patented drugs.

217
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.440
It's a position widely criticized by the public health world.

218
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.280
If drug companies had a little more leeway to produce generic versions of

219
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.330
life-saving drugs,

220
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.880
they would be able to make a dent in the millions of annual deaths from

221
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:12.780
treatable diseases.

222
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.070
And while bill Gates recently publicly argued that a COVID 19 vaccine needs to

223
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:19.800
go to those who need it the most, rather than the highest bidder.

224
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.590
<v 2>If we just let drugs and vaccines go to the highest bidders instead of</v>

225
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.750
to the people in the places where they're most needed, we'll have a longer,

226
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.600
more than just deadly or pandemic. Yes.

227
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.010
<v 1>Zero interest in tweaking patent laws against his own interest because he built</v>

228
00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:41.030
his entire fortune and continues to grow it with intellectual property laws that

229
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:42.590
protect Microsoft's profits.

230
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.940
McGaughey writes that his opposition may have single handedly forded efforts to

231
00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:49.760
open pharmaceutical markets to more generic competition.

232
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.620
But there's more McGaughey quotes, NGO director, James Love,

233
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:57.550
who explains that the Gates foundation funds most of the journalism on this

234
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:01.030
topic. And they have been hardline advocates for strong patent protection.

235
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:05.920
Since the 1990s, making an open discussion on the issue, even more difficult,

236
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.170
the influence of donors on the scientific community.

237
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.000
Isn't just limited to the Gates foundation.

238
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.890
McGaughey tells the story of David Healey,

239
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.520
a psychiatrist who was offered a job by the university of Toronto in 2000,

240
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.150
he then gave a talk discussing the limitations of clinical drug trials and

241
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:21.070
revealing rare side effects in Woking.

242
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:24.520
The example of Prozac turns out Prozac's manufacturer.

243
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:29.110
Eli Lilly is a major donor to the university of Toronto and provided over half

244
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:30.400
the funding to the department.

245
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.720
Healey was supposed to run his job offer was retracted a few weeks later,

246
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.870
if one cares about free and open academic debate,

247
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.070
one has to ask what kind of debate gets swamped based on pressure from donors.

248
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.190
And here's the frustrating thing about conspiracy theorist who see in the

249
00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:48.940
shadows cabals of pharmaceutical reps, attempting mass mind control.

250
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.300
If they turn on a lights, it's just the regular old free market,

251
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.820
which brings us back to ID 2020.

252
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.900
It's worth noting that the stated goal of ID 2020 is to create a digital

253
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:01.480
identity for people that they individually owned.

254
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.830
They're not proposing some gross centralized surveillance system. The truth,

255
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.280
the real conspiracy, if you will, is far more boring.

256
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.440
They're building infrastructure.

257
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.010
If you're a multinational corporation like Accenture or Microsoft,

258
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.150
a big impediment to doing business is lack of infrastructure in the developing

259
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:19.690
world.

260
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.380
Microsoft can't sell X-Box is if cities don't have electricity or internet,

261
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.460
Accenture can help companies run data driven ads. If there's no data to mine.

262
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.380
And here is the other quote, unquote,

263
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:32.080
conspiracy of a ton of corporate philanthropy.

264
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.520
It's just a tax-free way to build the infrastructure. Your company needs say,

265
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:39.910
you're a mining company looking to extract minerals in a remote part of Africa.

266
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.960
You need to transport supplies in and minerals out, but there's no road.

267
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.810
You could just pay for it. And Mark it as an expense,

268
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.520
or you could work through some charity.

269
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:52.210
You get a grant from the government to improve infrastructure and get the same

270
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:55.690
road built for practically free. This is just a made up example,

271
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:59.140
but there's plenty of real ones that McGaughey details where government loans

272
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:02.770
for charitable causes just act like venture capital on a risky new business

273
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:07.090
venture. Take Vodafone a company worth over 80 billion pounds in 2011,

274
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.000
which received 1 million in grants from the British government to launch a

275
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:12.010
mobile payment system in parts of Africa,

276
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.670
the system that would go on to become highly profitable for Vodafone and their

277
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:19.840
subsidiaries McGaughey writes while most people would agree that better mobile

278
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:23.110
access and services in the developing regions is a positive development.

279
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.530
Many would also suggest that Vodafone should incur it's own business cost.

280
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.400
Seeing as the company and its shareholders have full entitlement to all profits

281
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.670
minus taxes, a similar example lies in micro finance.

282
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.730
Very small loans meant to help people lift themselves out of poverty.

283
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.600
After raising billions of dollars in grants, contributions and government aid,

284
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.710
the real winners of the system are Western investors who reap billions in

285
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:48.670
profits from loans with incredibly high interest rates. In this case,

286
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.640
governments are subsidizing the risks companies take as they build up the

287
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:55.550
corporate and physical infrastructure to see if they can make a buck.

288
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.250
And with partners like MasterCard, Accenture, and Microsoft,

289
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:02.000
it's not hard to see why this might be an added bonus for donating to something

290
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:05.360
like ID 2020 after all digital IDs would function as well.

291
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.200
Digital infrastructure laying the groundwork for all kinds of business to be

292
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:12.020
conducted. Even if a person is in control of their ID,

293
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.530
it would allow them to willingly give up their information to apply for a credit

294
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:16.670
card or a micro loan,

295
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:20.240
or to sign away their privacy willingly and some gargantuan terms of service.

296
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.200
And from there, MasterCard can sell that information to advertisers.

297
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.740
And I want to be careful here because this is the one claim I'm making that

298
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:31.610
speculative, but I don't think it's a stretch to say somewhere down the line,

299
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.730
there will be a disagreement in how ID 2020 operates.

300
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.680
Let's say over a privacy concern.

301
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.560
When push comes to shove the people writing the checks,

302
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:42.980
not you or I or anyone using a digital ID in Afghanistan,

303
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.790
we'll get to decide which side wins. Unlike a conspiracy theorist,

304
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.900
I fully acknowledge that they might actually establish meaningful privacy

305
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:51.530
protection.

306
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.520
And I also know that plenty of organizations involved in ID 2020 really do just

307
00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:58.760
want a better way to provide healthcare to people like the Gates funded Gavi.

308
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.740
There's also the argument that even if MasterCard is itching to sell data,

309
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.890
Hey, at least all that greed might end up helping some people.

310
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.390
But one thing we do know philanthropy can be incredibly profitable journalists,

311
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:12.141
Tim Schwab notes,

312
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:15.380
that the Gates foundation has sent millions of charitable contributions to

313
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:16.730
for-profit companies.

314
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.850
Some of which the foundation owns stocks or bonds in companies like Merck,

315
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.511
Eli Lilly,

316
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:24.290
and Pfizer Schwab also notes that despite pledging to give away millions of

317
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:28.430
dollars, bill Gates, personal net worth continues to grow. In 2006,

318
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:29.570
he was worth 50 billion.

319
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.760
Today he's worth 118 billion and all Gates hasn't profited directly

320
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:35.630
from his foundation.

321
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.140
It's clear promotes policies that protect his own financial interests.

322
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.710
Of course, the obvious answer to all of this is it's his money.

323
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:47.120
He can do what he wants and yes, this is true, but it's worth noting.

324
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:51.410
He doesn't have to pay taxes and all those charitable donations, you may say,

325
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:54.350
this is a good thing. If I want to donate $50 to my church,

326
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:55.700
which I won't be taxed on,

327
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.780
isn't that a freer and more democratic form of giving than whatever the

328
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:02.210
government decides to do with my taxes. And yes,

329
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.200
there's a certain allure to millions of people freely choosing what causes their

330
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:09.200
money goes to before uncle Sam gets his grubby paws on it.

331
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.850
But with someone like Gates,

332
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.630
a single man has withheld billions of dollars in government revenue and

333
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.900
dispersed it according to his own. Sure.

334
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.570
You might not like where your tax dollars are going to,

335
00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:24.040
but at least elected officials can be held accountable when they allocate $20

336
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.810
million to research CyBorD murder dolphins.

337
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.410
Or maybe we love that idea because that sounds super cool and real like everyone

338
00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:31.420
involved again, democracy.

339
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.020
Now you won't hear stuff like this from the conspiracy sphere of the internet,

340
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.590
you do. It might be a brief footnote in some bigger evil or playing. Yeah,

341
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.090
but that's just the problem. We don't live in a crazy or Welly in dystopia.

342
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:48.010
We live in a very boring and aside from eroding trust science or causing measles

343
00:17:48.011 --> 00:17:50.100
outbreaks, this is big threat from.

344
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.210
<v 0>Conspiracy theories. People waste their powers of skepticism chasing Phantoms,</v>

345
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.330
instead of scrutinizing the very flawed reality we live in.

346
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.930
Even if you think bill Gates is an angel that every public health policy

347
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:04.500
promotes as a home run, that his money is better spent by him than uncle Sam.

348
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.640
You should at least consider the idea as espoused by fame poet, Kanye West,

349
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.010
that no one man should have all that power.

350
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.830
But what do you think wisecrack let us know in the comments,

351
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.920
big thanks to our patrons for supporting the channel and our podcast.

352
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.670
Now that the bill and Melinda Gates foundation will never give us money.

353
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.850
Maybe you should become a patron for $2 a month.

357
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.140
And that's just the beginning higher levels can get you access to our patron

364
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.780
We'll let you say you fund media coverage, that vocally criticizes you.

365
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.500
I'll also message you weekly affirmations, like forget the haters.

366
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:06.060
And at least you're not Mark Zuckerberg and all for less than 1 million of your

367
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:06.894
net worth,

368
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.700
that's a bargain go to patrion.com/wisecrack and joined today.

And once you do message me on our discord,

370
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:16.650
so you can tell me how to most efficiently organize my bookshelf.

371
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.813
I'll see you there.

372
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.450
