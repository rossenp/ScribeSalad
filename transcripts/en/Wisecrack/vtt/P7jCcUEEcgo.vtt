00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.220
<v 0>This episode is brought to you by Ridge wallet.</v>

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.280
Hey, wisecrack.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.990
<v 1>Michael here to remind you that.</v>

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.800
<v 0>There's no war in bosses. Of course there is.</v>

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.330
<v 1>It's very much a war going on, and that's what we're here to talk about.</v>

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.200
Avatar might look like just another cheerful kids cartoon about folks throwing

7
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:22.130
magic at each other,

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.330
but it actually might be the best exploration of war we've ever seen in

9
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.320
children's television.

10
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.800
It may not be the only kid show to depict armies and chosen ones,

11
00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:32.120
defeating evil Lords,

12
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.590
but avatar goes above and beyond to show an unexpected side of armed conflict.

13
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.420
So what exactly is it? Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on avatar,

14
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:44.480
the last Airbender, and of course, spoilers ahead.

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.940

34
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.180
Now back to the show. Avatar takes place in a world,

35
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.640
divided into four elemental nations.

36
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.390
The avatar is tasked with keeping them in harmony by learning to manipulate all

37
00:01:56.391 --> 00:02:00.170
four elements and acting as a global peacekeeper things start to go wrong.

38
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:03.020
When the fire nation begins its campaign for world domination.

39
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:07.250
While the current avatar is still just a 12 year old kid named Ang terrified by

40
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:08.300
his responsibility,

41
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.020
Ang fleas in the middle of a storm and ends up plunging into the ocean where he

42
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:14.510
lies frozen in ice for the next hundred years,

43
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.950
when he wakes up the world around him has been ravaged by a century of war from

44
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:19.610
the beginning.

45
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050
The show refuses to shy away from the effects of such a widespread drawn out

46
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:25.580
conflict. We meet siblings,

47
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:28.820
Katara and Saka who have lost their mother to the war and are tasked with

48
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:31.400
providing for their village while their father is away fighting.

49
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.570
We also quickly find out that an entire home in people have been destroyed,

50
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.630
rough stuff. And here from the very beginning,

51
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:42.800
we get a sense of what avatar is really about the human cost of war.

52
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.160
Once our trio embark on eggs quest to master the elements,

53
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.100
they feel the effects of the war everywhere they go.

54
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.560
Once peaceful villages have become police States.

55
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.670
Thanks to the occupying forces while the great city of Boston say has instituted

56
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:58.550
mind control methods to maintain a totalitarian order.

57
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.620
There's even an episode where villagers get poisoned by a nearby arms factor in

58
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.580
another featuring in imprisoned political dissidents, everywhere our crew goes.

59
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.670
They meet people who have lost partners, friends, and family.

60
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.930
We also get some realities of war dressed up as childish euphemism and the very

61
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.800
first episode Katara Warrens Ang not to go into an abandoned fire nation.

62
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.770
<v 0>Just in case it's booby trapped, Ang stop. We're not allowed to go near it.</v>

63
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.600
The ship could be booby trapped.

64
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.880
<v 1>This is a kid-friendly way to present.</v>

65
00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:30.780
What is a reality for many children who grow up in current or former war zones,

66
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.220
watch out where you play.

67
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.570
There might be some unexploded bombs or hidden landmines turned around and as

68
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:37.740
they begin their travels,

69
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:41.550
they find that almost everyone else has had their sense of home effected by the

70
00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:45.690
war in some way, for many people, this means the loss of that home altogether.

71
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.380
One episode CS Ang, and the gang guiding a group through a dangerous route,

72
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:51.480
inhabited by a deadly giant snake,

73
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.220
a fantastical take on the plate of real world refugees who traverse all kinds of

74
00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:59.250
dangers in the hope of arriving somewhere safe. Likewise,

75
00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:02.160
we also meet a group of exiled earth, kingdom civilians,

76
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:04.320
living in the remains of an abandoned air temple.

77
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.090
As the last living member of the air nation Ang is initially annoyed by how much

78
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:10.950
the newcomers have changed his Homeland.

79
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.390
<v 0>Do you know what you did?</v>

80
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.800
You'll just destroy them in fake grin for a stupid bath house. Well,

81
00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:18.600
people around here are starting to stink.

82
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.960
<v 1>Fleeing war. These refugees have found safe Haven,</v>

83
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.030
but are accused by Ang of perverting.

84
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:28.770
It avatar could easily have ignored this aspect of warfare because in real life

85
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:29.820
we often do.

86
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.200
We may talk about the refugee crisis as it relates to a specific conflict like

87
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:38.280
the war in Syria, but we rarely engage with how ubiquitous a part of war.

88
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:39.270
It really is.

89
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.620
Almost every major conflict in recent history has created a huge number of

90
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:44.430
refugees.

91
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.210
The American civil war saw hundreds of thousands of southerners fleeing their

92
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:52.110
homes while the Russian revolution, India, Pakistan, partition, Vietnam,

93
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:53.130
and Korean Wars,

94
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.240
all forced to millions to relocate a recent study from Brown university suggest

95
00:04:57.241 --> 00:05:01.590
that the war on terror launched in the wake of nine 11 has displaced some 37

96
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.210
million people to date. Basically anywhere you have a serious military conflict,

97
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.730
you have a serious refugee problem.

98
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.860
As the only remaining air nomad Ang himself is also a refugee realizing

99
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:16.740
that everyone he grew up with has been brutally murdered.

100
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.690
Ang is forced into the avatar state,

101
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.890
disappearing from himself and morphing into a swirling vortex of uncontrollable

102
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:23.730
pain and fury.

103
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.630
It's a powerful visual depiction of the depth of suffering caused by seeing your

104
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:29.730
home reduced to bones and ruins.

105
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.820
The damage goes far beyond the loss of the people he loved.

106
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.520
The monks were supposed to guide him in the ways of the avatar,

107
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.750
helping him to fully realize his own identity by connecting him to his past.

108
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.740
All of her identities are rooted to some degree in where we come from the

109
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:44.820
traditions and customs.

110
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:48.510
We are raised in lending us the sense that we are the continuation of something.

111
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.510
When these roots are ripped out, we can feel existentially.

112
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.110
<v 0>But you were right. And the fire benders found this temple.</v>

113
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.360
That means they found the other ones too. I really am the last terabit.

114
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.370
<v 1>Ang experiences this and in especially literal way because he is the</v>

115
00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:05.500
reincarnation of previous avatars,

116
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.010
spiritually tied to his past cells to become the most powerful,

117
00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:11.410
most fully realized version of himself.

118
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.200
This connection to the past must be nurtured and strengthened,

119
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.220
but without the monks there to teach him how Ang faces a much more arduous

120
00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:20.380
journey, other suffer, a similar pain,

121
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.560
one episode depicts a town in which earth bending has been outlawed,

122
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.580
leaving young earth benders like Haru cut off from their cultural heritage in a

123
00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:29.380
way which shatters their sense of who they are.

124
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.120
<v 2>Problem is the only way I can feel close to my father now</v>

125
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.390
is when I practice my bending, while.

126
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.760
<v 1>It might seem like a heavy term to invoke here,</v>

127
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.790
this is basically a portrayal of cultural genocide.

128
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.990
We're in the invading forces aimed to eradicate an entire culture by destroying

129
00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:51.340
its artifacts and gaining its practices after China annex Tibet in 1950,

130
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.120
it demanded the Tibetan people assimilate to Chinese culture in the name of

131
00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:55.690
unity.

132
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.100
Even the future Dalai Lama Tibetan Buddhism is Holy leader who is reincarnated

133
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:03.880
and discovered as a child must be approved by the Chinese government and the

134
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:08.140
United States and Canada native American culture was suppressed for generations,

135
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.910
my boarding schools and other policies,

136
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.990
forced native people to abandon their names, languages, rituals, and beliefs.

137
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.920
More recently,

138
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.670
ISOL has been known to destroy religious heritage sites and perform forced

139
00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:20.440
conversions wherever they can.

140
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.060
And each case the goal is to erase the victim's entire cultural identity.

141
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.310
Even before his home was destroyed.

142
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:31.330
The war had a profound impact on Angus upbringing while the avatar is not

143
00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:34.300
usually informed of their calling until they turned 16,

144
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.380
Ang was initiated four years early because of the looming specter of conflict,

145
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.760
the fire nation, not only steals Angus home history and adoptive family,

146
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.010
but a large part of his childhood as well.

147
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.650
War forces children to grow up far too fast,

148
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.100
speeding them through what should be the carefree portion of their lives to deal

149
00:07:51.101 --> 00:07:53.950
with the harshest of realities and the early episodes.

150
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.560
We see Ang still desperately trying to deny this.

151
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.920
He knows he has a job to do and cares deeply about the world,

152
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.880
but he also really just wants to be a regular 12 year old kid and go frighten

153
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:04.714
some fish.

154
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.350
<v 0>That's why we're here. Elephant, coy. I'm gonna ride it.</v>

155
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.360
<v 1>With his dad off, fighting in the war.</v>

156
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.410
Teenage soccer even tries to take on the adult responsibilities of defending his

157
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.740
tribe from invaders and attempting to assemble an army of toddlers.

158
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.250
<v 0>Fire nation could be on our shores any moment now, but I got it.</v>

159
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.200
And no potty breaks.

160
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.190
<v 1>While soccer's gang of a waist, high warriors is mostly played for laughs.</v>

161
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.510
It sheds light on one of the darkest realities of warfare child soldiers.

162
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.380
In the second world war Jewish children across Europe took up arms as part of

163
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:39.070
the Jewish resistance fighting for the existence of their people. Of course,

164
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:41.560
on the other side of that war, Japan and Germany,

165
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:45.550
both had child soldiers fighting for them after showing how the water tribe kids

166
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:48.160
are drawn into defending their home avatar examines,

167
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:51.040
how the children of their invaders are pulled into it as well.

168
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.100
<v 0>You're just a child. Well, you're just a teenager. And one episode Ang.</v>

169
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.010
<v 1>Is accidentally enrolled in a fire nation school.</v>

170
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.030
He watches as his classmates are fed propaganda to convince them that the fire

171
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:04.770
nation is on the right side of history.

172
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.740
<v 3>Question one, what year did fire load those in battle the air nation army,</v>

173
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.910
the real world.

174
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.481
<v 1>Parallels.</v>

175
00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:15.590
Aren't hard to find during the second world war elementary schools in Japan were

176
00:09:15.591 --> 00:09:18.170
made to teach children according to the Imperial way,

177
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:23.540
framing Japan as a Holy land that students had a divine destiny to protect and

178
00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:24.021
avatar.

179
00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:27.740
Doesn't shy away from the psychological scars that come with being a child

180
00:09:27.741 --> 00:09:31.820
soldier. Most obviously in its depiction of jet and his Merry band of Outlaws.

181
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.400
Having seen the fire nation wipe out their homes.

182
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.940
These kids have learned to meet violence with violence and formed a formidable

183
00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:38.774
rebel squadron.

184
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.230
At first Jenna's crew seemed like swashbuckling freedom fighters.

185
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.380
Their new way of life provides them with a heroic sense of purpose and

186
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:47.810
adventure. Offering them a measure of retribution,

187
00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:50.990
which nothing else will while we understand how they have become.

188
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.100
So radicalized,

189
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.090
the corrosive effect this has upon their humanity quickly becomes apparent.

190
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.070
<v 3>You born guitar and then take him for a walk, a long walk.</v>

191
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.610
<v 1>They are willing to destroy an entire village full of innocence,</v>

192
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.830
just to strike a blow against the fire nation,

193
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.810
cheering it as a victory for freedom.

194
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.480
The war has made them as ruthless as the enemy.

195
00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:15.530
They despise the fire nation might play the role of avatars evil empire,

196
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.040
but this show takes pains to highlight the fact that things are mostly not so

197
00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:19.700
binary.

198
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.810
Anyone that has been indoctrinated since birth or radicalized by revenge has to

199
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:25.760
be considered a victim of the war as well.

200
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.610
Even if they grew up to willingly participate in it,

201
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.300
we're creates generations of kids like Jett and Zuko with their grudges.

202
00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:35.390
So deeply ingrained that they will never stop fighting.

203
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.950
But avatars exploration of this goes far beyond the simple revenges bed.

204
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:44.150
You have to forgive people message that you might expect of a family friendly

205
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:48.110
cartoon. It emphasizes how difficult forgiveness is to achieve in a world.

206
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.500
So scarred by war. Take the episode in which guitarra meets Hama.

207
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.790
An old woman who was developed by far the creepiest technique in the avatar

208
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:57.200
universe, blood bending,

209
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.190
while the cackling old lady with the freaky power seems like pure horror movie

210
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.640
stuff.

211
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.690
We find out that she originally created the technique while imprisoned by fire

212
00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:08.060
nation soldiers. Along with the rest of her village,

213
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.390
blood bending allowed her to escape while everyone else perished.

214
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.200
It's hard to condemn someone for doing whatever it takes to survive in such

215
00:11:15.201 --> 00:11:18.650
impossible circumstances. Things become more complicated again.

216
00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:22.640
When we discover that Hamas has continued using her powers to take revenge upon

217
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:24.140
other fire nation citizens.

218
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.030
<v 3>It's you you're the one who's making people disappear during the full moons.</v>

219
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.990
<v 1>Twist in the tale comes when Katara is forced to use blood bending,</v>

220
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:36.110
to escape Hama putting her in the exact same position.

221
00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:38.240
The old woman was in all those years ago,

222
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.360
crossing a moral boundary in order to survive.

223
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.110
The episode is a masterclass and playing with the audience's sympathies.

224
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:47.840
As it draws them into ever murkier, moral waters,

225
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.440
it asks the question of when the victim becomes a victimizer in their.

226
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.170
<v 3>Own rights. That choice is not yours. The power exists.</v>

227
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.690
And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war at

228
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:06.250
Tara, a tried to wipe us out our entire culture. Your mother.

229
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.830
<v 1>Ideas are followed up a few episodes later when Zuko offers to help Katara track</v>

230
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.510
down the soldier that killed her mother,

231
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.480
having spent her entire life reliving her loss.

232
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.720
Katara imagines the soldier as a force of pure evil.

233
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.610
Once you finally meets the man himself,

234
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.320
she is shocked to discover how pathetic he really is a brow beaten, old coward,

235
00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:29.340
living a squalid unhappy life alongside his bad tempered mother Katara.

236
00:12:29.341 --> 00:12:30.990
Can't bring herself to kill someone.

237
00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:35.460
So wretched and so has denied the emotional closure of taking revenge. Again,

238
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.870
the episode ends on an ambiguous note where choosing to rise above the urge for

239
00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:42.420
vengeance can feel like letting evil, go on.

240
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.520
<v 3>You did the right thing.</v>

241
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.940
Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing,

242
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.610
but I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him.

243
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.350
<v 1>One of the most appalling things about any given historical atrocity is usually</v>

244
00:12:58.351 --> 00:13:02.640
how many ordinary people facilitated it. Joshua Oppenheimer's documentary.

245
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:06.810
The act of killing made this unsettlingly clear by providing an up close look at

246
00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:10.710
members of the Indonesian death squads who brutally murdered almost a million

247
00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:14.940
people in the sixties, even as they reminisced openly about their awful crimes.

248
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.530
They never came across as anything other than regular, fairly unimpressive guys.

249
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.690
In some ways it would be more comforting.

250
00:13:21.691 --> 00:13:25.530
If we could believe all evil deeds are done by her vertically evil people,

251
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.850
but it Qatar also finds out most of the foot soldiers are depressingly regularly

252
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.120
slipping back into regular lives. Once the shooting stops,

253
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.660
it's what philosopher Hannah rent would call the banality of evil.

254
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.280
Unlike these other characters,

255
00:13:38.281 --> 00:13:42.870
what really marks Ang as our hero is that he remains resistant to violence all

256
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:45.960
throughout the show. Even after all the war has taken from him,

257
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:48.540
he is determined to find a way back towards peace.

258
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.310
<v 3>I took away your fire bending.</v>

259
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.850
You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.

260
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.120
<v 1>When backed into a corner, he will fight to protect those.</v>

261
00:13:57.121 --> 00:14:00.630
He cares about such as when he transforms into the avatar state to defend the

262
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.760
Northern water tribe. However, afterwards,

263
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:05.460
we find him clearly traumatized by the events.

264
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.440
Everyone around him considers him a hero,

265
00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:09.960
but Ang is horrified by the destructive power.

266
00:14:09.961 --> 00:14:14.670
He unleashed tearing apart an entire fleets by himself while Ang is clearly

267
00:14:14.671 --> 00:14:17.250
special in his commitment to nonviolence the show,

268
00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:20.280
mostly avoids labeling good guys and bad guys,

269
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.760
rather it depicts a war ravaged world full of complex people,

270
00:14:23.761 --> 00:14:26.220
struggling with trauma that is hard to overcome.

271
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.810
So what do you think is avatars eviction of war uniquely profound or does

272
00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:35.040
Harry Potter do it better? Should we all be watching Gundam wing instead,
