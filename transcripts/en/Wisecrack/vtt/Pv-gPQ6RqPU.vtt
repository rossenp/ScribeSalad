<v 0>This video is brought to you by Warby Parker.</v>

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.320
What's up wisecrack Michael here,

3
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:13.160
and I am back to pudding in my doctorate in philosophy to the most honorable of

4
00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:13.790
uses,

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.690
analyzing the philosophical merit of fictional debates in popular television.

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.900
And for this one, we need to visit the Athens of the mid Atlantic,

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.690
the gathering place of poets and scholars alike.

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.720
Patty's pub you probably know how much we love.

9
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.430
It's always sunny in Philadelphia,

10
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.270
but you might be wondering if you missed the episode featuring a rigorous

11
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.920
philosophical debate. Well,

12
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:38.480
the philosopher in question is one Ronald McDonald and the lecture we're

13
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:41.660
considering is this careful deconstruction of the theory of evolution.

14
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.340
<v 1>Because evolution doesn't exist. Of course.</v>

15
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.660
<v 0>I'm sorry. And before you call me at your Brony, well,</v>

16
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:48.470
let me persuade you in today's video.

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.620
A philosopher reacts to it's always sunny in Philadelphia,

18
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.770
but before we continue, I want to give a quick shout out to this week's sponsor.

41
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.510
Now back to the show in case you haven't seen this episode in a minute,

42
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.140
here's a quick refresher. Frank rear ends Dennis's beloved rain drover,

43
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.350
which causes him to spill the bowl of cereal. He was eating while driving,

44
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.540
because how else would you eat cereal?

45
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.350
But somehow in their efforts to seek justice things, go off the rails.

46
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.820
<v 1>Reid mental institution here by decrees Frank Reynolds to not have</v>

47
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.710
donkey brains.

48
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.530
<v 0>Then evolution comes up and Catholic Mac puts together a poster board</v>

49
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.910
presentation on why science is a liar sometimes. And in the process,

50
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:45.110
he inadvertently gets into two super interesting and contentious philosophical

51
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:45.620
topics.

52
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.820
The reliability of scientific knowledge and the debate between faith and reason.

53
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.743
Let's get into it.

54
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.020
<v 1>Now, this is all about making myself credible in your eyes again,</v>

55
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:58.520
and I'm going to do that by admitting that evolution is a

56
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:03.340
lot, as you can see, this is the evolution meter,

57
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:07.630
and I've put God the creator of everything on the right side and evolution

58
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.033
on the left.

59
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.350
<v 0>Lots to talk about, uh, sadly, won't get into Mac's lovely shirt, but I,</v>

60
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:15.420
I love what he does right here.

61
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.580
So by putting evolution on the left and religion on the right. Yeah,

62
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.020
you get it. Basically. It seems like Mac is pointing out what you already know.

63
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.670
It's certain forms of conservative.

64
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:31.560
American Christianity are quote unquote anti-science and there's precedent for

65
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.340
that, with what the church murdering heretics for hundreds of years in all.

66
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.680
But this divide isn't inevitable. After a few well-intentioned thinkers,

67
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.780
uh, took one for the team.

68
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.280
The enlightenment brought on a whole new era in which scientific thought was not

69
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.140
only allowed, but encouraged.

70
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.110
It was like emo kids used to be picked on in high school,

71
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.440
but then all of a sudden it went mainstream and sad looking dudes and tight

72
00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:57.150
pants became the new jocks.

73
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.720
But this new era of science didn't leave religion behind. In fact,

74
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:04.500
many enlightenment philosophers found no contradiction between God and

75
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:06.810
rationality with Descartes thinking.

76
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:10.350
God was still the foundation of all our knowledge and con constructing a system

77
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.490
that left room for faith.

78
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.300
But clearly Mack didn't learn about this at Catholic school because he's setting

79
00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:19.380
up a pretty clear either or paradigm. Let's keep going.

80
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.530
<v 1>Stand here, present some egg heads,</v>

81
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:27.060
scientific argument based on fact, I'm just a regular dude.

82
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.110
I like to drink beer. You know, I love my family rock flag in Eagle, right?

83
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:32.790
Charlie, he's got a point.

84
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.020
I won't change my mind on anything regardless of the facts that are set out

85
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:41.400
before me, I'm dug in and I'll never change.

86
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.110
<v 0>Okay, let's dig in. Then this gets at an important distinction.</v>

87
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.380
One Mack says he won't change his mind no matter what,

88
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.250
he's not describing faith. As most religious galleries would define it.

89
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.090
He's describing fanaticism, a fanaticism,

90
00:04:57.091 --> 00:05:01.950
which is usually defined as obsessive zeal and uncritical enthusiasm as a type

91
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:04.440
of blind faith. In which those who don't agree with you,

92
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:08.280
aren't simply different. They're just wrong or worst actively.

93
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:12.390
Your enemies fanaticism is like faith that got real drunk and decided that

94
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.810
everyone in the bar wanted to start some it's not good.

95
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.920
And historically fanaticism functions as a politicized version of faith,

96
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.010
which leads to stuff like the crusades, colonialism,

97
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:25.320
which trials and Kirk Cameron's film career,

98
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.100
all of which are crimes against humanity, German philosopher,

99
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:33.450
Emmanuel Kahn noted the important distinction between faith and fanaticism for

100
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.200
him. A person can have faith and still exercise reason,

101
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.500
but fanaticism is a blatant misuse of reason.

102
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.240
So basically once you enter the land of fanaticism reason is out the window

103
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.990
and bad things are probably going to happen. So, um,

104
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.180
let's watch some bad things happen.

105
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.650
<v 1>Not going to get us to not believe in evolution. And why is that?</v>

106
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.050
Because the smartest in the entire world all agree that it's.

107
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.530
<v 0>Okay. So, um, Dennis right here is touching on an uncomfortable truth.</v>

108
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.770
Many of us believe in things like evolution,

109
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.070
because some authority figure told us to, as a result,

110
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.320
a lot of people claim that science is in itself, another kind of religion. So,

111
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.270
um, let's see how this plays out.

112
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.830
<v 1>Science is a liar. Sometimes</v>

113
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.760
this is Aristotle thought to be the smartest man on the

114
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:33.880
planet. He believed that the earth was the center of the union.

115
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.470
<v 0>Okay. So, so yeah, it's true. He did.</v>

116
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.830
He also thought that eels grew out of mud and well,

117
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.460
Aristotle might've been a bad astronomer with very little understanding of the

118
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:46.780
dynamics of ELL sex.

119
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.260
He also used his free time to create the intellectual foundations for

120
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:52.480
philosophy, theology, ethics, natural science,

121
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:56.830
and mathematics for hundreds of years to come. Um,

122
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.380
but I'm sure max is, he's about to say that right now.

123
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.520
I'm sure let's watch him do it.

124
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.520
<v 1>Until another smartest guy came around Galileo and he just proved</v>

125
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:10.750
that theory making Aristotle and everybody else on earth look like a.

126
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.200
<v 0>Okay. Um, yes, it's true.</v>

127
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.050
He momentarily kind of holds like a, but again,

128
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:23.020
he kind of also invented natural science. So, uh,

129
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.430
you win some and you lose some, um, let's see where Mac takes us next.

130
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.960
<v 1>Galileo, then thought comments weren't optical illusion.</v>

131
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.010
And there's no way that the moon could cause the ocean's tides.

132
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.810
He was also wrong making him and everyone else on earth.

133
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.790
Look like a again.

134
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.090
<v 0>Okay. Um, honestly, I can't stop thinking about max shirt.</v>

135
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.480
So anyone watching this, if you know where he got that shirt, um, or, you know,

136
00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:52.270
put it up on email, I'll buy it from me for a lot of money, but, but again,

137
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:57.100
okay. So the guy Galileo was trying his best with the tools he had. Also,

138
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.010
he helped prove that the earth revolves around the sun.

139
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:04.600
So not bad for some dumb science. Okay. Up. Let's keep going.

140
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.670
<v 1>Sir. Isaac Newton gets born and blows. Everybody's nips off with his big brains.</v>

141
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.181
Of course,

142
00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:13.300
he also thought he could turn metal into gold and diet eating mercury,

143
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.440
making him yet another stupid fish.

144
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.810
<v 0>And you have to respect his, his conviction there. Um,</v>

145
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.460
but as Ronald has explained,

146
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.020
one way to look at massive shifts in scientific understanding is to say that

147
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.150
anytime someone comes up with new ideas,

148
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.520
they make previous scientists look like.

149
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.220
But instead of seeing this as a bad thing,

150
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.720
we might reframe it as a good feature of science, a philosopher of science,

151
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:44.710
Thomas Kuhn called these moments of scientific humiliation paradigm shifts,

152
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:50.140
rather than looking at human knowledge as one consistent process of fine tuning.

153
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.580
thought that every now and then knowledge takes a massive and revolutionary leap

154
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.410
forward. That undoes a lot of what came before and, you know,

155
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.370
makes everyone look like fidgets. For example, for a long time,

156
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:07.080
smart science is thought disease was spread by bad air. And that as a result,

157
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.920
fresh air could treat things like tuberculosis or influenza,

158
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.660
but then people like Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur made some paradigm shifting

159
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:17.280
discoveries. For example,

160
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:21.930
that tiny microscopic church called germs were giving us life ending diarrhea,

161
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.820
but not everything about the old theory was wrong. Uh, the bad air stuff,

162
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.590
AKA miasma theory,

163
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.040
who was actually right about some things specifically that poorly ventilated,

164
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.740
dirty and crowded spaces tended to spread disease.

165
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.960
A fact confirmed by germ theory from their germ theory would go on to

166
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:43.380
also explain all kinds of other new mysteries that my asthma theory couldn't

167
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:44.100
like, uh,

168
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.540
why boiling milk is a good idea because these paradigm shifts create new types

169
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:49.374
of understanding.

170
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.540
A thought that different paradigms necessitated making those before you look

171
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:58.200
like. Those, those are a hundred percent his words, which he absolutely said.

172
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.820
For example, once you discover that the earth isn't the center of the universe,

173
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.020
previous astronomy is basically useless. And as you can imagine,

174
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.970
those from the previous era might feel pretty as their life's work is now

175
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.190
obsolete. And this is why max plank,

176
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.170
a German physicist said that a new scientific truth does not triumph

177
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:21.810
by convincing its opponents and making them see the light.

178
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.700
But rather because its opponents eventually die and they new generation grows

179
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:30.990
up that is familiar with it. Or in max terms, if you try to make me look like a,

180
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.170
you're going to have to prove me wrong over my cold dead body. Okay.

181
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.800
Uh, that got dark. Um, let's, let's get back to patties.

182
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.140
<v 1>Mr. Reynolds. These were all the smartest scientists on the planet.</v>

183
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:50.030
Only problem is they kept being wrong sometimes.

184
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.500
<v 0>Ooh, that's sometimes it's doing a lot of work. Uh,</v>

185
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.360
but this is still kind of interesting because whether you're Mac or Thomas Kuhn,

186
00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:04.340
you might ask why trust these people who are always inevitably wrong,

187
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.170
but it's more complicated than that.

188
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.370
We might consider how every paradigm seeks to understand a phenomenon,

189
00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:11.990
but also to make predictions.

190
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.580
And so miasma theory could predict the good ventilation and clean air would stop

191
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:20.810
the spread of disease. And it was right in that respect even before then,

192
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:23.180
the reigning paradigm was created by Hippocrates.

193
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.680
We thought that in imbalance of humor's constant illness and according to his

194
00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:30.920
observations, it could explain some things like why,

195
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:34.670
when one humor phlegm showed up in the throat, people would start coughing.

196
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.790
It's not that a pocket was doing good science,

197
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.620
but even his flawed theory had a certain ability to explain human health before

198
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:45.630
further investigation poke holes in that paradigm. Well,

199
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:50.600
the point is historically paradigms are useful and also make people look

200
00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:54.220
dumb when more useful paradigm show up. So for philosophers of science,

201
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:58.690
the existence of paradigm shifts is a good thing because it shows that science

202
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.460
isn't a Holy dogmatic or fanatic enterprise. Also that it's a type of knowledge.

203
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:07.420
That's able to disprove its all assumptions and accept new truths.

204
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.500
If scientists weren't able to acknowledge that they were wrong sometimes or in

205
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.050
max terms, if science wasn't a discipline,

206
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.520
then we would still believe that bleeding out could help with the flu or that

207
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:21.760
semen from the right testicle creates male babies and semen from the left

208
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:25.390
testicle creates girl babies, which sounds like something Charlie would say,

209
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.260
but it's actually something the Roman thinker Pliny, the elder thought.

210
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.790
But of course, as everyone knows,

211
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.690
you have a boy baby of right before you have yogurt with sprinkles on it.

212
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:36.940
And you have a girl baby, right before you finish,

213
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.870
you say that's a spicy meatball, but everyone already knows that.

214
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:42.220
So let's get back to Mac.

215
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.110
<v 1>Well, because I have more faith in the saints that wrote the Bible. Yeah.</v>

216
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.580
Because you just read the words of a bunch of guys that you never met and you

217
00:12:50.581 --> 00:12:53.610
just take it on faith that everything they wrote was true.

218
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.220
<v 0>Okay. So, um, remember the difference between faith and fanaticism? Yeah.</v>

219
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.390
That's what's happening here. Um, this isn't genuine faith.

220
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.410
This is reckless belief without the possibility of seeing otherwise as former

221
00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:09.360
glass bubble car enthusiast, Pope John Paul,

222
00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:13.800
the second said faith without reason leads to superstition, which once again,

223
00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:18.630
forces us to ask what did Mack actually learn at Catholic

224
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.840
school? Um, maybe tell us in a second.

225
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.410
<v 1>Do you think what your scientists are writing is any more truer than my saints?</v>

226
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:29.880
Because there are volumes of proven data numbers, you know,

227
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.230
figures. There are fossil records. Okay. Uh.

228
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.460
<v 0>Let's see if this is any more truer. Um, so,</v>

229
00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:41.850
so what's the difference between max saints and Dennis's data

230
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.670
numbers and figures. It's pretty simple.

231
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.660
While the saints might have some pretty useful mythology and stories that can

232
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:52.140
help you live a good life. It's not scientific data.

233
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.490
It's like comparing your wise grandma who told you to never look an Irishman in

234
00:13:56.491 --> 00:14:00.870
the eyes to genetic research. One is pretty messed up folk wisdom.

235
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.540
And the other is grounded in observable evidence.

236
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.380
But what if you haven't seen that empirical evidence for yourself?

237
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.670
Part of why belief in science is a little different from belief in religion is

238
00:14:11.671 --> 00:14:14.400
that science is a different institution with different values.

239
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.480
The scientific community has norms of peer review of reproducing experiments to

240
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:21.570
make sure the other person didn't make mistakes or even straight up lie.

241
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.510
And that results are consistent over time.

242
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.350
But what about dinosaurs? Let's see what that.

243
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.340
<v 1>Oh, fossil records. Ah, I didn't even think about the fossil records,</v>

244
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:35.550
I guess I'll concede. Oh wait, one more thing before I do Mr. Reynolds,

245
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.010
have you seen these fossil records? Okay. Um, now.

246
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.760
<v 0>I might not personally go look for dinosaur bones,</v>

247
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.690
but I can trust that if someone tried to pass off some glued together chicken

248
00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:51.590
parts as a dinosaur, somebody else in the field would catch it.

249
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.270
It's also worth noting that this isn't a perfect system free of bias,

250
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.960
but it's got a few more safeguards than pastor bill said,

251
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:02.960
dinosaur bones are the remains of the demons who tempt you to have premarital

252
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:04.400
sex at church camp.

253
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.080
You don't have to obscene fossils to know that a stegosaurus existed any more

254
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:10.040
than you need to dig up.

255
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.840
Abraham Lincoln's bones to know that he was tall science like history

256
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.200
is built upon the consensus and collective knowledge of intellectual

257
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:19.034
communities.

258
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.360
So it's not a matter of simply having faith that dinosaurs really existed.

259
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.021
Rather.

260
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:28.010
It's about having some trust in the traditions of natural science to accurately

261
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:32.240
communicate peer reviewed, verified findings and data. Um,

262
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:35.270
and I'm sure like max is going to be convinced. So, so we're fine.

263
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.150
<v 1>Huh? Have you poured through the data yourself? The numbers, the figures.</v>

264
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.160
<v 0>The numbers and the figures. Okay. Um, once again,</v>

265
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:50.170
this just doesn't matter. Um, I, I don't have a degree in aviation,

266
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.750
but that doesn't mean planes don't fly.

267
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.160
Also have you're pigging between paying for degree in philosophy and aviation

268
00:15:57.161 --> 00:15:59.620
for the love of God study aviation,

269
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.270
but that's neither here nor there. So let's get back to our friends.

270
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:09.310
<v 1>Well, no, no. Oh, interesting. So let me get this straight,</v>

271
00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:10.144
Mr. Reynolds,

272
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.070
you get your information from a book written by men you've never met and you

273
00:16:15.071 --> 00:16:19.930
take their words as truth based on a willingness to believe a desire to accept a

274
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.820
leap of faith.

275
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.240
Dare I say it faith.

276
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.980
<v 0>I don't know about you, but, uh, Frank and Charlie looked pretty convinced.</v>

277
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.240
See what's happening here? Is it.

278
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:36.100
Mac has reverted to his either or paradigm about faith and reason,

279
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.270
but a centuries worth of philosophers maintained faith and reason can co-exist

280
00:16:40.271 --> 00:16:44.140
without breaking your brain. Uh, actually, unless you're Charlie,

281
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.370
in which case your brain will most definitely overheat. Um,

282
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:49.623
let's see what they say next.

283
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.590
<v 1>Come on, look. I mean, I don't even know how I'm supposed to respond to that.</v>

284
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.040
Like that is,

285
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.180
that's a false equivalency. Just answer the question, Mr. Reynolds.

286
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.600
Sure. Yeah. Okay.

287
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.690
<v 0>Mac broke Dennis, I think. Um, and,</v>

288
00:17:07.691 --> 00:17:12.370
and this is where Dennis gets himself into trouble because scientific knowledge,

289
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.560
isn't a matter of faith. It's grounded.

290
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:18.520
Like I said earlier in institutions and fields of research that have their own

291
00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:22.180
internal systems of criticism and verification that require evidence.

292
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.230
And by not understanding why science is different than religious faith,

293
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.000
he's ended up looking like a stupid science. Okay. Uh,

294
00:17:31.001 --> 00:17:33.820
we're almost there. Let's see how they wrap this whole thing up.

295
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.090
<v 1>I rest my case. Well that got me</v>

296
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.900
on the fence. I mean, it's a shadow.

297
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.440
You actually don't believe in evolution anymore. I don't know.

298
00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:48.160
He created reasonable doubt. He makes you sound like a stupid science.

299
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.360
<v 0>Okay. And there it is. Uh, but more seriously,</v>

300
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.550
the real irony of max lecture is that the whole faith versus reason debate

301
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.730
was largely settled. Heres and years ago, uh,

302
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.270
philosophers from Aquinas to Descartes, to Conda, Hegel, to Kierkegaard,

303
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.140
didn't see a contradiction between religious belief and rational knowledge and

304
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.020
help even the Catholic church in the current Pope,

305
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.590
don't see any contradiction between their theological beliefs in the theory of

306
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:20.880
evolution or the big bang theory. So why is max so upset?

307
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.940
This force contradiction between faith and reason,

308
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.070
isn't really a philosophical problem,

309
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.570
but a political one rather than delving into an interesting philosophical

310
00:18:30.571 --> 00:18:33.780
problem. Mack is merely parroting a culture war.

311
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.530
His fanaticism is seemingly an attempt to return religion back to the pre

312
00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:42.090
enlightenment days of burning heretics and converting via the sword a time,

313
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:44.880
which was to use the technical term, not chill,

314
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.830
careful philosophical reflection on both science and religion make both stronger

315
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:53.430
and more intellectually rigorous. As the old saying goes faith,

316
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:57.660
without reason is blind and science without philosophy is Neal the rest Tyson's

317
00:18:57.661 --> 00:18:59.880
Twitter feed. So in conclusion,

318
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.690
Matt brings up some important questions to which he offers some fairly

319
00:19:03.691 --> 00:19:08.340
ridiculous solutions. And Dennis might technically be more writer than Mac,

320
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.730
but he falls into the trap of treating science like its own religion.

321
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.290
But most importantly,

322
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:17.280
and the thing I really want you to take away from this video is that even though

323
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:21.630
it's stupid to eat cereal while driving it's absolutely Frank's fault and he

324
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:23.310
should provide satisfaction.

325
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:27.180
But what do you guys think is Mac actually pointing out some fundamental issues

326
00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:28.410
in the philosophy of science?

327
00:19:28.411 --> 00:19:31.740
Does Dennis have more in common with Neil deGrasse Tyson than one might think

328
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.650
and is D actually a bird, let us know in the comments.

329
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.100
We'd also love to hear about other shows, movies or sex Colts.

330
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.110
You'd like me to give a philosophical reaction,

331
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:43.170
to be sure to hit that subscribe button, like your rear ending.

332
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.770
You're not real sun and ring that bell. Like it's last call it patties.

333
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.500
And as always, thanks for watching later.

334
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:09.620
