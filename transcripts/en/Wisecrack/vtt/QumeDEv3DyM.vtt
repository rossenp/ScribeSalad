<v 0>This video is brought to you by dragon city.</v>

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.110
What's up wisecrack Michael here.

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.780
What's the deal with comedians delivering the news.

4
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:16.070
Are they comedians or reporters pick a lane in all seriousness,

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.220
if you've consumed any of the horrible news lately, there's a good chance.

6
00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:22.760
At least some of it came from comedians like Trevor Noah, John Oliver,

7
00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:24.140
Samantha bee, or his son,

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.920
the notch with a host promising to make their comedy more informative and

9
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:28.940
politically engaged.

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.030
It seems like they're intentionally pitching themselves as an alternative to

11
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.870
cable news and all Trevor Noah and Samantha B might be more entertaining than

12
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.210
Chris Wallace, original Maddow. We can't help,

13
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:41.870
but wonder is comedy news a brilliant symbiosis of the comedic and the

14
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:42.560
political,

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.580
or is it just a kind of mental junk food that occasionally makes us snicker?

16
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.510
<v 2>I came off to him again tonight. I bet when he got in his car,</v>

17
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.190
she just popped up in the backseat like, Oh, and another thing.

18
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.690
<v 0>Let's find out in this wisecrack edition comedy news,</v>

19
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.530
deep or dumb before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to dragon city,

20
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.450
a mobile RPG available on iOS and Android. Dragon city is like a hero collector,

21
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.370
but instead of heroes, you collect dragons,

22
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.550
generate gold to buy food and level up your dragons for battle.

23
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.970
There are hundreds of dragons hidden in dragon city for you to collect.

24
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.090
I recently found the binge dragon, the movement addict dragon,

25
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.960
and this serial killer dragon. You want to collect as many dragons as you can,

26
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.170
but it's also possible to breed different dragon species to complete your

27
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:27.440
collection here. I bred my binge dragon with the movie fanatic dragon,

28
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.340
and they had the neon dragon collect as many dragons as you can and use them to

29
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.040
battle download the game for free using the link in the description.

30
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.080
Now back to the show, first,

31
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:39.890
a bit of history on comedy news shows much like the career of John Oliver.

32
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.970
Modern comedy news was born in England before finding success in America.

33
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.060
The germinal versions of the comedy news format can be seen in the work of

34
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:50.000
frequent collaborators, Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris,

35
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.810
two British political satirists who collectively were behind shows like Veep and

36
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:56.780
the thick of it, as well as movies like four lines and the day shall come.

37
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.040
Their first TV show,

38
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:02.870
the day-to-day aired in 1994 and offered a satirical take on British news while

39
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:04.100
it brought up current events.

40
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:07.370
The show had no intention of being informative and instead focused on the

41
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:08.810
absurdity of news media.

42
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.820
Morris's next show brass was an even more intense [inaudible] of the sensational

43
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.290
tone of current affair shows.

44
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.560
<v 1>There's your 26,000 pounds, but I'm watching you from a balloon.</v>

45
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.580
And I can see a very long way. I go along with that.

46
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.640
<v 0>That's most infamous episodes was the P to get in special,</v>

47
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.030
which explored the moral panic and hysteria around pedophiles and the

48
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:30.340
sexualization of children.

49
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.720
<v 1>Media just North is released tomorrow.</v>

50
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.950
Can we be sure that pervert mechanics haven't built him one of these,

51
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.850
of course we can't the episode. Yeah.

52
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.990
<v 0>Immediately led to over 3000 complaints and criticism from government officials</v>

53
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.550
while the work of, again, Eugene Morris,

54
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.300
a novel standard for using the news format to create comedy magic,

55
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.040
their aim was satirizing society and the media not providing actual news or

56
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.700
information. This was the basic ethos of even the original daily show,

57
00:02:58.701 --> 00:02:59.860
hosted Craig Kilborn,

58
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.610
which focused on covering oddball stories and offered comedic takes on historic

59
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:04.410
events.

60
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.110
<v 1>Getting everyone together, getting everything to work out</v>

61
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.850
and laughter turns to tears.

62
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.930
<v 0>It also included lots of field pieces, which according to former anchor,</v>

63
00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:22.110
Steve Carell were a little too mean in hindsight,

64
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.440
but no one was watching the first iteration of the daily show in hopes of

65
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:27.000
getting their daily dose of news.

66
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.470
This all changed when Jon Stewart took over the show in 1999 under stewards

67
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.260
reign, the show became significantly more news driven.

68
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.010
This shift was put into sharp focus by their coverage of the 2000 election and

69
00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:40.590
politics after nine 11, by 2009,

70
00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:44.400
a time magazine poll showed that steward had become the most trusted news anchor

71
00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:49.350
on the air steward even effectively shamed real news show CNN crossfire out of

72
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:53.340
existence by appearing as a guest and roasting its host for their sensationalism

73
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:54.300
and partisan hackery.

74
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.380
<v 1>You're partisan. Um, what do you call it? Hacks.</v>

75
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.571
<v 0>Stuart.</v>

76
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:04.770
The daily show was so influential that basically every single comedy news show

77
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:08.490
right now is hosted by its alumni, including John Oliver, Samantha bee Hassan,

78
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:09.810
Minhaj, and Wyatt snack.

79
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.500
And then there's Steven Colbert who used his daily show spinoff as a stepping

80
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:17.310
stone to eventually become the host of CBS is the late show history aside,

81
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.560
is this modern format deep or dumb?

82
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.460
Does this injection of comedy make for an even better method of asking questions

83
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:25.380
and informing the audience to figure that out,

84
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:27.000
we're going to get some help from comedy theorist,

85
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.750
Todd McGowan and his book only a joke can save us from a gallon.

86
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:34.860
Comedy happens when we were surprised by a moment where lack and excess meat put

87
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:38.220
simply a moment where something that seems insignificant is treated with

88
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:42.180
excessive importance or a moment where something very significant is treated

89
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.590
with the lacking indifference.

90
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.380
And sometimes these moments not only make us laugh,

91
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.900
they help us to rethink the world around us.

92
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.980
But let's start with the meeting of excess and lack while this sounds a little

93
00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:57.060
heady McGowan uses the example of the black Knight in Monty Python's Holy grail

94
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.460
in which the Knight loses all four limbs in a sword fight,

95
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.110
but refuses to give up claiming that each subsequent severed Lin is just a flesh

96
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:04.860
wound.

97
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.640
The lack in this example is quite literally the black Knight's missing limps.

98
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.990
The excess is the absurd confidence. He continues to exhibit as he dies.

99
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.400
It's the bringing together of two disparate elements,

100
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.000
brutal violence and reckless confidence that creates this comedic moment.

101
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.390
It's the same reason that it's funny when Michael Scott Burns his foot on a

102
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:28.230
George Foreman grill in the office, which is a dumb household injury,

103
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.980
and then insist on sneaking his foot inside of an x-ray machine if he had the

104
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:33.570
same injury, but treated it like it,

105
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:37.530
wasn't a big deal that wouldn't be comedic if he had a serious injury and

106
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:39.720
treated it seriously. Also not funny,

107
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.290
but a non serious injury treated with absurd seriousness.

108
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:47.010
Does the trick while using a philosophical formula to evaluate comedy,

109
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:50.340
seems about as fun as bringing a dietician with you to taco bell.

110
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.000
It can help us see what the funniest comedy news shows have in common and make

111
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:57.060
sense of when jokes fall flat. So let's look at the origin,

112
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.380
the modern comedy news wave in America, the original daily show,

113
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.950
many of the earliest segments on the show involve correspondence like Steven

114
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.880
cold bear and Steve Carell going out and interviewing small town politicians or

115
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.630
odd oddballs with the journalistic intensity of reporting on war crimes.

116
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.620
But most modern comedy news has shifted away from field reporting and absurd as

117
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.830
characters towards talking head style monologues. For example,

118
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.350
in this recent segment from full frontal, with Samantha B,

119
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.130
she talks about the very serious issue of reopening America in light of the

120
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.580
COVID-19 pandemic. And while there are some genuinely funny zingers.

121
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.710
<v 3>Trump called on people to liberate Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia, Hey,</v>

122
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.900
the Franklin mint chest sets from this new civil war. God be ugly.

123
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.320
<v 0>Mostly talks about the dire seriousness of the situation.</v>

124
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.620
So we have an excessive response to an excessive situation.

125
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.650
One might themselves not along and agree with be in the segment,

126
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.140
but you're probably not unexpectedly chuckling.

127
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.310
And sure not everything needs to be funny or funny as McGowan defines it,

128
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:57.490
but there is another kind of pitfall to this style of comedy news.

129
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.690
It lacks what McGowan argues makes comedy politically potent in the first place,

130
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.050
which helps get us into the relationship between comedy and political news.

131
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.050
The gallon thinks that there is an inherent connection between comedy and

132
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:08.680
politics.

133
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.880
Writing comedy has the potential to act as a site for radical emancipatory

134
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:13.540
politics,

135
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.050
but it can just as easily function in the most ideological fashion in the guise

136
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:18.880
of radicality. In other words,

137
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.780
comedy can be a magic pill that helps open our eyes to what's really going on,

138
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.180
or it can simply reaffirm the status quo.

139
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.660
It can help us see contradictions in our world or pass a bias into Contently

140
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:31.180
chuckling about nobody taking away grandma's keys.

141
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.410
Jokes can make us question our world and ourselves or jokes can just affirm what

142
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:36.490
we already know.

143
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.880
And that's why when Trevor Noah talks about the impeachment trial and the daily

144
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:42.820
show, there aren't any truly surprising comedic moments.

145
00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:46.000
As it's assumed that most of the audience already agrees with the particular

146
00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:48.580
point of view being expressed, the jokes aren't pointing out,

147
00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:52.090
any instances of lack or contradictions either in Noah, himself,

148
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.410
or with the audience instead, all lack and critique is on one side, of course,

149
00:07:56.411 --> 00:08:00.340
this isn't universally true for Noah or any of these shows later in the same

150
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:03.610
segment correspondent Michael Costa does some reporting from the field,

151
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:06.220
which places, some critical lack on the side of the Democrats,

152
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:08.140
joyously celebrating Trump's impeachment,

153
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:10.330
but it's more or less a softball criticism.

154
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.970
<v 3>It's downright depressing. Yeah. Nancy today sucked.</v>

155
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.930
<v 0>How many like this usually doesn't challenge preconceptions.</v>

156
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:23.350
It's simply affirms that this is why I'm a gallon writes that comedy has the

157
00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:25.570
ability to deprive us of our safety net.

158
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.380
And this is why recognizing what's at stake in comedy has the status of an

159
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.430
ethical imperative.

160
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.120
Comedy is related to ethics because it can distance us from our comfortable

161
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:37.840
worldview and challenge us to notice the contradictions and our own ideals.

162
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.900
We can see a comedy news show that functions like this and the work of yet

163
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:44.470
another daily show alone Hassan Minhaj, and his show Patriot act.

164
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.190
Unlike the nightly news format used by the daily show and full frontal Patriot

165
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:51.670
act uses the format of an investigative journalism show to deep dive into a

166
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:53.710
specific topic with each episode.

167
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.230
And the nausea's particular often achieves what McGalin calls egalitarian

168
00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:58.590
comedy,

169
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.340
which is when both the source of the comedy and its target appear divided

170
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:02.910
internally.

171
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.900
It is the emergence of this internal division that enables us to laugh while

172
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:10.890
also facilitating critique. For example, in the episode about Amazon Minaj,

173
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.220
doesn't just talk about how Amazon is ethically dubious while we not along in

174
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.460
the knowledge that we also have the correct opinion. Instead,

175
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.330
the episode points out that we are complicit in some of the things that are bad

176
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:23.340
about this company by participating in it.

177
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.130
So the source of the comedy Vonage and the target,

178
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:30.150
Amazon both juxtaposes the excessive wealth of Amazon and the lack of ethical

179
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:34.080
treatment of its employees and our own excessive knowledge of these wrongdoings

180
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.360
with our own lack of commitment, to doing anything.

181
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.180
<v 4>Unlike Facebook and Google who need your customer data to sell ads to</v>

182
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:45.050
businesses, Amazon is a one-stop shop. They know who you are,

183
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.550
what you buy and we'll sell it directly to you. Despite knowing all of this,

184
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.030
I'm not going to lie. I'm still going to use Amazon.

185
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.950
It's an essential utility for me.

186
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.280
<v 0>So for comedy news, to work as a source of news and information,</v>

187
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.970
it has to be capable of evaluating all sides of an issue or a story.

188
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.410
Even if that means making visible,

189
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:05.720
the contradictions shared by the host and audience.

190
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.290
This is why comedy news shows often work best when they swing both ways,

191
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.720
which isn't to say that these shows are sexually open,

192
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.350
but rather that they use comedy to critically consider both ends of the

193
00:10:15.351 --> 00:10:19.400
political spectrum. Even if doing so challenges, the audiences assumptions.

194
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.880
This was a particular strength of Stuart's tenure on the daily show while

195
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:24.830
Stewart was firmly situated on the left,

196
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.430
he had no qualms about roasting his own camp. Without that ethos,

197
00:10:28.431 --> 00:10:30.380
we end up in the danger zone of clapper,

198
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.690
where rather than responding to jokes with laughter,

199
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.890
we clap along to affirm that we also agree with the right ideas when a comedy

200
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:40.370
news show veers too far into clapper, we end up with what McGowan calls,

201
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.090
conservative comedy, which doesn't refer to conservative political parties,

202
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:48.530
but rather to comedy that aims to affirm ideologies rather than challenge them.

203
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.070
We can see this in the previously mentioned full frontal segment where Samantha

204
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:55.790
B affirms one point of view that implies the exclusion of another,

205
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.440
this style of comedy news locates,

206
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.790
all of the lack or ridicule on a particular external group or authority and

207
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:05.180
locates, the excess of goodness on the side of its host and audience,

208
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.050
it might criticize authority, but it leaves the viewer and host unscathed.

209
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.760
And of course this criticism goes beyond laughter, but cosmic,

210
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.890
Alan thinks that comedy has an inherently philosophical structure.

211
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.400
Any news source aiming to really seek out the truth would have to operate with

212
00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:22.190
the same commitment to locating a lack in the social order.

213
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.430
And most studies and surveys have long shown that many young people consider

214
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:27.770
comedy new shows as their primary news source.

215
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.040
Other studies have shown that these people might have good reason to do this.

216
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.550
Researchers at the university of Delaware actually found that regular viewers of

217
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:38.240
satirical news were better informed than regular viewers of cable news.

218
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.750
And it's not too surprising that the most informed of these viewers were those

219
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:44.360
regularly watching last week tonight with John Oliver,

220
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.570
the show has become known for wide ranging critiques of powerful people and

221
00:11:47.571 --> 00:11:51.160
institutions and its ability to inspire social changes led to multiple news

222
00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:53.650
sources. Writing about the John Oliver effect.

223
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.770
This effect has led to massive campaigns against the tobacco industry

224
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.870
televangelists and the coal mining industry.

225
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.770
So it seems like at its best comedy news is capable of the type of humorous

226
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:06.610
reporting that can lead to social change by criticizing both those in power and

227
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:08.050
its audience, but at its worst,

228
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:11.530
it offers the sort of ingroup logic that creates more thoughtful nods than it

229
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:15.040
does gut busting laps while some like the daily show with Trevor Noah and

230
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.850
full-frontal might lean towards the latter category shows like last week tonight

231
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.920
and Patriot act have veered towards the former.

232
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.360
This all leads us back to our initial question, is comedy news deep or dump?

233
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.230
It seems there rather than falling simply on one side of this dichotomy,

234
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.440
that comedy news is both deep and I'm sorry,

235
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.160
it's deep when it challenges our preconceived notions and dumb when it leads to

236
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:40.990
self satisfied clapper and each show probably has genuine moments of both.

237
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.600
But what do you think wisecrack is comedy news,

238
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:46.030
a valuable source of both lasts and information?

239
00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.970
Or is it just a low stakes way to relax by chuckling at the news?

240
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.030
Let us know what you think in the comments. And before you go,

241
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:54.040
I want to give one last shout out to dragon city.

242
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.050
Once you have a collection of dragons,

243
00:12:56.051 --> 00:13:00.130
you can take them to battle and collect gold and exp use food to level your

244
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:03.310
dragons. And after some training, they should be ready to win some battles.

245
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.440
The game offers different PVP modes,

246
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:08.110
where you can take your favorite dragons and fight in the leagues or in the

247
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:10.450
arena. There are new events every week,

248
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:14.800
like match three puzzles and mazes start growing your dragon collection and go

249
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:15.790
to battle today,

250
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.420
hit the link in the description to download the game for free and as always,

251
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.560
thanks for watching guys.
