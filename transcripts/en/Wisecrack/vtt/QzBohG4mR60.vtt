00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.890
<v 0>This video is brought to you by keeps</v>

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.190
[inaudible].

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.240
<v 1>The wisecrack Jared here coming from these self isolating comforts of my own</v>

4
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:14.840
apartment. And let me tell you, I got a bad feeling about this. No,

5
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:18.290
I'm not just talking about my dwindling supplies of top ramen and coffee,

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.880
but well, this.

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.450
<v 0>I have a bad feeling about this. I got a bad feeling about this.</v>

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.600
I got a bad feeling about this. I've got a bad feeling about it.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.771
<v 1>Yes.</v>

10
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:31.670
The time has finally come to delve into the least controversial subject on the

11
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:32.504
internet,

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Little yarn called star Wars.

13
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.160
When the rise of Skywalker was set for release director,

14
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:44.150
JJ Abrams promised this final entry in the saga would tie up everything that had

15
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.950
come before per the filmmaker.

16
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.070
This wasn't just the end of a single movie or even a trilogy.

17
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.100
It was the end of an entire nine films saga.

18
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.000
It had to be the end of not just three movies, but nine movies.

19
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.530
The question of course,

20
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.030
could the rise of Skywalker possibly tie up every loose end in story thread in a

21
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:06.590
satisfying way. I mean, this is a gargantuan seemingly impossible task,

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.670
and yet somehow they did it after the film's release.

23
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:14.900
The rise of Skywalker was lauded as the best star Wars film of all time.

24
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.760
And the internet came together in universal celebration. Oh wait,

25
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.160
sorry. I was imagining an alternate timeline.

26
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.340
We're going out to the grocery store. Isn't an episode of black mirror. No,

27
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.480
the rise of Skywalker was of course a colossal disappointment filled with

28
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.070
awkward exposition plot holes and strange red conning of its predecessors.

29
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.110
So what the hell happened? How did the rise of Skywalker fails? So, absolutely.

30
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.680
Well the answer lies in the past. You know, that thing,

31
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:44.750
the last film kinda sorta tried to kill.

32
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.100
<v 0>Sorry, kill it. If you have to.</v>

33
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.340
<v 1>So welcome to this wisecrack edition on the rise of Skywalker,</v>

34
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.420
what went wrong and of course, spoilers ahead for the whole Skywalker saga.

35
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.470
But before we get into it,

36
00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:00.770
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor keeps it can be hard to admit

37
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:03.500
that you're losing your hair, especially when in my case,

38
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.920
it's pretty intertwined with my identity. It's tough to talk about,

39
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:11.630
but ignoring it won't solve. The problem with hair loss prevention is key.

40
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.200
Two out of three guys will experience some form of male pattern baldness by the

41
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.630
time they're 35. And although I'm praying,

42
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:22.100
I'm the one out of three it's best to be sure keeps is an affordable hair loss

55
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.370
let's get into a quick recap. The rise of Skywalker begins with the resistance,

56
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:07.330
intercepting a message that Palpatine is somehow not only alive and well,

57
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.740
but amassing a fleet of ships on the hidden planet, exit goal, our heroes, Ray,

58
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.041
Finn,

59
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.760
and Poe go in search of a Wayfinder that will lead to the mysterious planet.

60
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.391
Meanwhile,

61
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:20.770
Kylo Ren at the behest of Palpatine is tasked with killing Ray and ending the

62
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:22.630
Jedi once. And for all, from there,

63
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:26.200
you get your typical light saber duels chases rescue missions and cameos by

64
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.340
beloved characters.

65
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.270
There's even some new character revelations and backstories Kylo basically tells

66
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:34.330
Ray not to pay attention to anything that happened in the last Jedi.

67
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.800
<v 0>They're filthy jump traders. So to offer drinking money</v>

68
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.810
in a pauper's grave in the jacuzzi desert.

69
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.980
<v 1>Instead it turns out Ray, isn't a nobody, but actually.</v>

70
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.510
<v 0>Don't trust have power. You have his power.</v>

71
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.883
Don't want his granddaughter.

72
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.360
<v 1>This is followed by some more lightsaber duels chases and rescue missions</v>

73
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.900
interspersed with a classic character heroically sacrificing themselves,

74
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.290
the film culminates in an aerial battle between the resistance and the first

75
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:08.280
order while Ray faces off against Palpatine with the help of bad guy gone light

76
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.840
Kylo, Ren Ray kills Palpatine, but in doing so dies, of course,

77
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:14.760
10 seconds later, Kylo brings her back to life,

78
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.710
sacrificing himself in the process.

79
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.290
We end with Ray taking up the mantle of the sky.

80
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.070
<v 0>Walkers, who are you? I'm Ray,</v>

81
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.873
Ray ho.

82
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.150
<v 1>If all this sounds very familiar,</v>

83
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:40.350
like you've seen this same story play out before. Well that's because you have,

84
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.280
oddly enough,

85
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.760
George Lucas spells it out in a behind the scenes featurette on the making of

86
00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:45.900
the Phantom menace.

87
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.380
Lucas explains how anagen is directly modeled after Luke Skywalker.

88
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.430
<v 2>You see the echo of where it all is going to go.</v>

89
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.260
And instead of destroying the death star,

90
00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:58.740
he destroys the ship that controls the robots. Again, it's like poetry.

91
00:04:58.741 --> 00:04:59.670
So if they run.

92
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.451
<v 1>For Lucas,</v>

93
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:04.620
the story of star Wars was all about how history is constantly repeating itself.

94
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.340
There are hundreds of echoes in the prequels directly correlating to the

95
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.360
original trilogy.

96
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.780
A young Anacon blows up the control ship just as Luke will blow up the death

97
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:13.440
star.

98
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.520
Both guys lose a hand and a lightsaber duel obiwan watches helplessly as his

99
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:18.240
mentor.

100
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.870
QuakeCon gin is killed by Darth Maul mirroring obiwan his own eventual demise

101
00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:24.240
with Luke helplessly, watching from the sidelines.

102
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.360
And it isn't just these plot elements that bridge the two series together.

103
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.320
Even the visual language of the prequels directly mirrors the original trilogy

104
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.000
to quote another scifi. Epic.

105
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.040
<v 0>It's happened before. And all of that will happen again.</v>

106
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.420
<v 1>There's one person who took Lucas's approach to heart JJ Abrams in an interview</v>

107
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:45.720
for the force awakens Abraham stress. The importance of repetition.

108
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.050
Part of the story of this movie is history repeats itself,

109
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.610
but Abrams took Lucas's approach one step further getting super meta to the

110
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:58.490
filmmaker. It wasn't just history that was repeating, but the actual themselves,

111
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.760
I wanted to tell a story that was not just history repeating itself,

112
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.080
but a story that embraced the movies that we know as the actual history of this

113
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:10.550
galaxy, this is not about a nostalgia play. It felt to me like a way of saying,

114
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.200
let's go back to a star Wars that we know so we can tell another story for

115
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:15.621
Abrams.

116
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.730
The fact that the force awakens is pretty much a carbon copy of a new hope is in

117
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.150
and of itself. The point for a pop culture, savant like Abrams.

118
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.880
It's not enough to merely echo the events that came before.

119
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.080
Instead he has to repeat them and copy the previous trilogy wholesale,

120
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.730
thus raise a stand-in for Luke Kylo for Darth Vader PO for Han solo.

121
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.870
Even the basic story is the same a group of rebels fight against the nefarious

122
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.190
imperialist army hell.

123
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.190
There's even a droid with an important message that can turn the tides of the

124
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.840
war. Now, Lucas and Abrams.

125
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.230
Aren't the first people to claim that history has a tendency to repeat itself.

126
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.800
This notion dates all the way back to the dialectic bad boy himself,

127
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.580
gay Yorkville home Hagle in haggles lectures on the philosophy of history.

128
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:59.630
The philosopher famously stated that revolutionary acts always tend to occur

129
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:02.420
twice per Hagle in all periods of the world.

130
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.010
A political revolution is sanctioned in men's opinions when it repeats itself by

131
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:07.731
repetition,

132
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:11.090
that which at first appeared in merely a matter of chance and contingency

133
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.910
becomes a real and ratified existence.

134
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.500
As proof Hagle cited the formation of the Roman empire Caesar Caesar first led a

135
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:22.610
revolution to take over Rome and the Republic and become its defacto emperor.

136
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.860
Many objected to Caesar's reign though,

137
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.130
leading to a second revolution in which he was assassinated,

138
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.450
but in the aftermath,

139
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.590
this second revolution only reinforced the idea that one single emperor was

140
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:37.880
needed to rule in effect cementing Caesar's initial revolution to destroy the

141
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:39.320
Republic. In a nutshell,

142
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.220
the revolution has to happen a second time to make the first one work.

143
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.180
The latest trilogy of star Wars films adopts this same philosophy in the

144
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:50.570
original trilogy, the rebels defeat emperor Palpatine and the empire.

145
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.590
But this revolution is short-lived in the ashes of the empires defeat.

146
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.510
The first order rises to power,

147
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.800
thereby prompting a second revolution in the rise of Skywalker, Ray, Finn,

148
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.290
and Poe lead. The second rebellion to victory.

149
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.110
Finally cementing the rebels victory that came before.

150
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.720
It's pretty much exactly as Hegel himself described the revolution repeating

151
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:13.900
twice in order to fully take effect yet in channeling,

152
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:18.400
the spirit of Hagle Abrams has fallen into a kind of historical trap set forth

153
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.330
as an addendum to Hegel's philosophy in 1852 philosopher,

154
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.330
Karl Marx stated that history doesn't quite repeat itself.

155
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.920
Instead it parodies itself. As he writes, Hagle stated that all great world,

156
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:33.490
historic facts and percentages appear. So to speak twice.

157
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.160
He forgot to add the first time as tragedy.

158
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.540
The second time as farce for marks, when a revolution repeats itself,

159
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.000
it's not the cement that reinforces the original,

160
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.820
but is instead a mockery of what came before.

161
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.000
Mark's most famously applied this criticism to Louis Bonaparte,

162
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.320
the nephew of Napoleon who much like his uncle led a rebellion to seize France

163
00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:54.190
and become emperor.

164
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.870
Louis even led his COO on the anniversary of his uncle's coronation as the

165
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.910
emperor of France yet for Marx,

166
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.870
Louie was nothing but a character of the old Napoleon dressing up like his

167
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.540
famous uncle repeating his same populous rhetoric,

168
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.190
but betraying Napoleon's own principles for marks little Louis duplicates,

169
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.010
the cult of Napoleon in order to legitimize himself.

170
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.870
But without the values of his uncle,

171
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.890
he became nothing more than a hollow parody. History had repeated,

172
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.760
but merely as a farce of the original, just like Napoleon 2.0,

173
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.030
dressed up as his legendary uncle without understanding what made him a

174
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:31.140
competent leader rise of Skywalker dresses itself in the nostalgia of star Wars

175
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:33.990
without understanding what made the original trilogy great.

176
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.970
Instead of crafting a new mythos,

177
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.990
the film borrows from what's come before using the exact same plot points,

178
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.880
archetypes and even sets.

179
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.660
But the end result becomes nothing more than a parody of its predecessors.

180
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.471
For example,

181
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:50.370
consider how the rise of Skywalker treats raised flirtations with the dark side.

182
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.030
This is the same arc as Luke's and return of the Jedi. But in that film,

183
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.420
Luke truly did grapple with joining his father at one point,

184
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.260
even succumbing to his darker impulses yet in the rise of Skywalker,

185
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.860
this arc is never fully dramatize. Ray has a dark vision,

186
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.300
does a little force lightening,

187
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.050
and that's pretty much it Palpatine tries to tempt Ray into succumbing to her

188
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:12.090
darker impulses just as he attempted Luke,

189
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.900
but Ray barely flinches from her morals. It's all talk.

190
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.430
The Ark exists simply for the sake of repetition. It's just, as Mark said,

191
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.440
history repeats itself first as a tragedy. And then, well as this,

192
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.850
even the rise of Skywalker's twists are lifted from the original trilogy.

193
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.510
The Ray Palpatine granddaughter reveal is basically just a water down,

194
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.030
but the Palpatine reveal lacks any of the dramatic weight of its predecessor in

195
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:39.990
the original trilogy.

196
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.680
Luke believed his father was a Jedi hero who was betrayed and murdered by

197
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.420
Darren.

198
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.980
<v 3>A young Jedi named DaVita who was a pupil of mine until he turned to</v>

199
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.720
evil, helped the empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.

200
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.650
He betrayed and murdered Joe father.

201
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.100
<v 1>When the big Vader turn happens, it shatters everything.</v>

202
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.270
Luke believed to be true. It undermined the foundation of his moral compass.

203
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.040
His father wasn't a hero,

204
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.940
but the villain who betrayed the Jedi and killed his surrogate father.

205
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.140
Now let's look at Ray.

206
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.110
Ray thinks her parents were junk traders who abandoned her.

207
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.100
So the reveal that Palpatine is her grandfather doesn't hold the same emotional

208
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:22.760
weight. It's not like she wanted to be a great Jedi to emulate her dead parents.

209
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.391
Also,

210
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:26.990
Ray hasn't even met Palpatine yet and knows nothing about him other than he's a

211
00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:31.550
bad guy. And once she finds out Palpatine is her grandfather not much changes.

212
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.220
He's still just a guy that needs to be defeated.

213
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.760
Her world hasn't been shattered in the same way that Luke's was. If anything,

214
00:11:37.761 --> 00:11:41.360
the Palpatine twist is more of a revelation for fans as they recount all the

215
00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:45.620
great prequel memes they've seen rise of Skywalker is filled with these moments

216
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.540
like Louie dressing up like his uncle,

217
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.980
the film incessantly dresses itself up like the originals repeating word for

218
00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:54.130
word shot per what happened to them.

219
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.190
But without any of the contexts that made these moments work,

220
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.070
these moments only exist as hollow callbacks,

221
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.610
any emotional or dramatic heft is entirely dependent on the viewer's

222
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:07.360
relationship to the original trilogy. Just look at how rise of Skywalker,

223
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:09.490
butchers, Han Solo's most famous line.

224
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.673
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

225
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.430
I know this.

226
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.810
<v 1>Hearkens back to one of the most famous moments in empire strikes back. I love.</v>

227
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:24.000
<v 0>That.</v>

228
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.690
<v 1>Simple exchange was the culmination of Han and Leia's tumultuous. Will they?</v>

229
00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:29.550
Or won't they romantic relationship?

230
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.150
The reason the line has become a touchstone for the characters and the series as

231
00:12:33.151 --> 00:12:35.640
a whole is because of the buildup beforehand,

232
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.330
the original films put in the work with their relationship to make this single

233
00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:42.000
line iconic. But in the rise of Skywalker,

234
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.850
the lines just reused as a reference for fans.

235
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.950
It doesn't have any narrative value in the film,

236
00:12:46.951 --> 00:12:48.930
except as a way to remind viewers of a movie,

237
00:12:48.931 --> 00:12:52.830
they feel nostalgic for rise of Skywalker is built on references,

238
00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:54.090
but it doesn't take into account.

239
00:12:54.091 --> 00:12:58.350
The hundreds of moments beforehand that may these iconic moments work,

240
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.330
the relationships, the characters,

241
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:04.260
the world building that were the foundation to the original series success.

242
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.180
And without this footing, these references are just that hollow and empty.

243
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.800
A farce of the original trilogy rise of Skywalker becomes so obsessed with

244
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.310
hearkening back that it even sacrifices, logic and its own characters,

245
00:13:17.311 --> 00:13:20.760
motivations at the behest of these callbacks. For one,

246
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.100
how the heck is Palpatine even alive?

247
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.040
Why bring him back as the villain in the first place? Well,

248
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:28.380
let's take it from JJ Abrams. The more we talked about.

249
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.370
<v 4>The more inevitable it felt that this character who was so important in the</v>

250
00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:37.200
first two trilogies, uh, come back and, and in some form.

251
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.960
<v 1>That's the truth. In a nutshell, Palpatine is the bill.</v>

252
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.660
And only because he's the bill and from the first six films,

253
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.260
it doesn't make any sense that the emperor has somehow survived being thrown

254
00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:50.730
down a reactor shaft and blown to smithereens in return of the Jedi rise of

255
00:13:50.731 --> 00:13:53.850
Skywalker doesn't care. Somehow Palpatine returns.

256
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.540
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

257
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.780
<v 1>Without any clear logical reason for Palpatine's return.</v>

258
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.560
The character feels like a farce of who he wants was even palpate King's

259
00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:06.720
motivations. Now don't make a lick of sense.

260
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.980
He sends Kylo to kill Ray yet when Ray shows up and confronts him at the end of

261
00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:14.100
the film, Palpatine changes his tune completely, right?

262
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.570
<v 0>I never wanted you dead. I wanted you here.</v>

263
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.920
<v 1>This yet again is a direct callback to the original trilogy or Palpatine tried</v>

264
00:14:22.921 --> 00:14:24.330
to convert Luke to the dark side.

265
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.950
<v 0>Looking forward to completing your trip in time.</v>

266
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:32.040
You will call me last time.

267
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.930
<v 1>Thus, the only reason why Palpatine's motivation rise of Skywalker changes is to</v>

268
00:14:36.931 --> 00:14:41.190
mirror his motivation in return of the Jedi and rise of Skywalker is litter.

269
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.450
These inconsistencies,

270
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.350
how does Palpatine suddenly a massive fleet of ships all equipped with planet

271
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:47.310
destroying weapons?

272
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.850
Doesn't really matter because rise of Skywalker has to end with an aerial space,

273
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.820
just like return of the Jedi.

274
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.450
The rise of Skywalker attempts to elevate itself to the Heights of the original

275
00:14:56.451 --> 00:15:00.080
films by playing on their success structure and nostalgia.

276
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.250
But instead the film becomes nothing more than a sad copy of a copy.

277
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.140
It's so obsessed with hearkening backwards,

278
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:10.280
that it never creates an identity of its own history has now become star Wars

279
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:12.680
own undoing. Well, what do you guys think?

280
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.290
Are we being too hard on the ninth star Wars film,

281
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.320
or is it really just a bargain bin version of the return of the Jedi?
