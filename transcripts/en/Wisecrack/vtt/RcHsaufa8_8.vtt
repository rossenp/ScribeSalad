<v 0>This episode is brought to you by Ridge wallet,</v>

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.870
Crack Michael here, still in the same room in the same house.

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.980
I haven't really left since March and I'm recording another video all alone in

4
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:18.740
this room in front of the same. God.

5
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.240
Sorry about that folks.

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.140
Now I'm very eager to grab a drink with friends without the specter of death

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.870
haunting me. And I'm sure you are too. As citizens crave,

8
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.250
basic social interaction and the economy craves our spending technologies and

9
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:38.420
policies designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus are popping up everywhere

10
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.710
from boring, but well-established proven methods like washing social distancing,

11
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:45.740
and wearing a mask over your mouth and nose to newer approaches like

12
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.410
smartphone-based GPS tracing and thermal imaging cameras.

13
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.820
Repurposed to check for fevers,

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.870
governments and businesses are ready to try anything that will get our terrified

15
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:58.310
asses off the couch and into the nation's cubicles and inexplicably sticky diner

16
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.271
routes. Now,

17
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:04.250
while we are 100% ready to luxuriate in the taco bell dining experience,

18
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.310
we wouldn't be wisecrack. If we didn't ask the tough questions,

19
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.760
like to what extent our newer policies surrounding COVID 19,

20
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:14.150
keeping us safe from infection and still harder to think about.

21
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.260
Are they even supposed to welcome to this wisecrack addition on security

22
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.170
theater? But before we continue, I want to give a shout out to this week.

23
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:22.220

38
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.620
to be clear, we're not here to peddle conspiracy theory,

39
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.940
mask and social distancing work to dramatically reduce the spread of COVID-19

40
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.440
cover your nose kids.

41
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.040
But as we're about to find out whether you're trying to manage viruses or

42
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:16.874
terrorism,

43
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.810
there's more to this seemingly basic concept of security than you might expect.

44
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.960
If you're in a state that has tried reopening restaurants and bars,

45
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:25.970
or even if you hopped on a plane,

46
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.120
you might have encountered new procedures meant to make us feel safe.

47
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.740
These range from restaurants and bars operating at diminished capacity to States

48
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:36.800
like New York only allowing outdoor dining to businesses,

49
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:39.860
touting extra cleaning procedures to buildings in some airports,

50
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:43.820
testing out using thermal scanners to identify people running potentially COVID

51
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.880
induced fevers, but not all strategies are equal.

52
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.710
Some are questionably effective at best and potentially harmful at worst as

53
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:54.530
Evan Selinger and Brenda Lee young put it in a recent article,

54
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.700
installing thermal scanning as part of a back to work process might create a

55
00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:03.040
false sense of security that convinces some to prematurely return to their jobs

56
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.400
and emboldens others to relax more effective strategies such as social

57
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:08.740
distancing and responsible contact tracing efforts.

58
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.730
A quick definition contact tracing is the practice of tracking down people who

59
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.960
were exposed to another sick person in order to proactively treat or isolate

60
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:18.640
them and contain the spread of the disease,

61
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.360
selling her and Leon claim that thermal scanning and other fancy looking quick

62
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.900
fixes are not true security. Rather, there were privacy expert.

63
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:30.460
Bruce Schneier has famously called security theatre or security measures that

64
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.920
make people feel more secure without doing anything,

65
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.630
to actually improve their security.

66
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.200
Think for instance of the little yard signs that security companies planted

67
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:42.100
front lawns to let passers by know that the designated house is protected by an

68
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:42.881
alarm. Now,

69
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.090
seeing that placard as you come home everyday may help you sleep better at

70
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:49.330
night, which is arguably a good thing in and of itself.

71
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.900
But it's important to remember that the sign itself can not actually detect or

72
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.820
prevent a break-in or slow it down.

73
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:58.930
Once it has started when an angry bowel rod comes to steal your PlayStation,

74
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:01.960
that little piece of metal on a stick is not going to pull a Gandalf.

75
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.360
So you and your uninsured gadgets can escape out the back door.

76
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.750
<v 2>Maybe the one.</v>

77
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.620
<v 0>Deters people,</v>

78
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:14.670
or maybe you just advertises to thieves that they need to be extra careful when

79
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:18.360
robbing you as convenient as technologies like remote temperature taking in

80
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.680
real-time phone enabled contact tracing would be selling during Leon point out

81
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:25.740
that so far, they just don't cut the proverbial mustard.

82
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.530
Silicon Valley loves to tote glitzy new GPS,

83
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.950
backed ways to track the spread of disease, but as reported in wired,

84
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.310
many health officials don't consider contact tracing programs that use

85
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:39.450
smartphone location data to be as effective as traditional human based contact

86
00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:40.320
tracing programs.

87
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.950
Then there's temperature checks and the thermal imaging airline's pushed in may

88
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.890
for temperature checks at airports. Dr. Martin said Tron,

89
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:51.300
the CDC director of global mitigation and quarantine called the idea a poorly

90
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:55.140
designed control and detection strategy and an earlier screening by the CDC of

91
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:59.070
over 30,000 passengers did not catch a single COVID-19 case,

92
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.880
even though some of the same passengers later tested positive for the virus and

93
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:06.480
per the Washington post thermal imaging cameras have not demonstrated the

94
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:10.260
ability to detect internal body temperature with the accuracy of more basic

95
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:11.880
thermometers. In other words,

96
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.570
organizations around the country are spending a lot of money to install

97
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:19.500
technologies that apparently do not work for their stated purposes of protecting

98
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:23.550
people from infection. But why, while in casual conversation,

99
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:27.300
we might understand the word security to mean the process of keeping people

100
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:28.134
safe.

101
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.130
Schneider contends in his book beyond fear thinking sensibly about security in

102
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:36.660
an uncertain world that it's not nearly that straightforward. According to him,

103
00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:40.890
what we call security is actually a complex interplay between the different

104
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:44.700
agendas of the various individuals and organizations invested in a given

105
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:47.340
situation. What he calls the players,

106
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.810
a given security policy emerges out of the negotiations between these players

107
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.010
influenced by the relative levels of power between them resulting in a program

108
00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:59.390
that serves the interest, the most powerful players first and foremost,

109
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.280
and may or may not actually increase safety for end-users as an almost secondary

110
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.640
goal as sample Schneier sites.

111
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.850
The fact that in the immediate aftermath of nine 11 tweezers,

112
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.260
a nail files were banned on planes while some actually combustible materials

113
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.390
lighters were allowed through this.

114
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.050
According to Schneider was the result of the relative influence of the tobacco

115
00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:22.390
lobby on the government's decision making process.

116
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.780
One player pressuring another big tweezer.

117
00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:30.550
Unfortunately didn't have the cloud to stay off the TSH security

118
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:34.330
theater happens when the more powerful players involved are focused on their own

119
00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:37.750
self-interest to the detriment of the holistic security of the system they

120
00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:40.360
participate in from these circumstances.

121
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.230
Policies can emerge that create the appearance of doing something without

122
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.820
actually making people safer.

123
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.650
Still players can find such systems very attractive Schneier claims

124
00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:54.430
offering security theater can improve market share just as much as offering

125
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.670
actual security. And it is significantly cheaper to provide.

126
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.290
He also notes that most people are comforted by action, whether good or bad.

127
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.320
The most infamous example of such a system is again,

128
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.430
the post nine 11 airport security system and the wake of the attacks.

129
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:13.300
The most powerful players involved had an overriding political and economic

130
00:07:13.301 --> 00:07:16.990
agenda to get people flying again, as soon as possible,

131
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.800
which meant that they had to make the average citizen feel safe enough to do so.

132
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.040
The resulting air force security theater satisfied the government's need to

133
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.470
implement a public facing response to terror,

134
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.850
as well as the airlines need for your sweaty pocket cash. In other words,

135
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.840
set system provides the biggest players with what they want while not

136
00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:38.980
necessarily making flying significantly safer to put it bluntly.

137
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:41.290
From this point of view, the federal government employees,

138
00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:43.900
many thousands of TSA agents and purchases,

139
00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:47.920
an equal number of hideous blue shirt and black pants combos to make the average

140
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:49.450
citizen feel safe enough to fly,

141
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.870
even though the process of taking off your shoes down in your entire water

142
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:54.580
bottle and one ill swag,

143
00:07:54.581 --> 00:07:57.790
and having a tired middle-aged man examine your junk via a body scanner,

144
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.660
probably doesn't make you that much safer consider friends since the fact that

145
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:05.530
in one nationwide test of the system conducted by Homeland security in 2015,

146
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.250
undercover agents were able to smuggle mock explosives and weapons through

147
00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:12.820
security checkpoints, a whopping 95% of the time.

148
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.990
And you thought your last annual review in bed, unfortunately,

149
00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:20.470
many of the criticisms applied to our handling of airport security can be

150
00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:24.250
applied to some though not all of our society's current attempts to address the

151
00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:28.180
problem of coronavirus building off of Schneider's framework law professor and

152
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:29.050
privacy expert.

153
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:33.250
Peter Swire has gone so far as to claim that we may be facing a kind of public

154
00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:36.880
health theatre on par with the security theater installed in the wake of nine

155
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:41.290
11, citing the temptation for government agencies to resort to unreliable phone

156
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:45.280
location tracking is the lazy man's approach to contact tracing Swire claims

157
00:08:45.281 --> 00:08:48.490
that government officials had great incentives to show the public.

158
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:51.700
They are doing something, anything to address the crisis. However,

159
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.830
his swear goes on to note that absent and empirical showing accuracy and

160
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.480
actionability that does not exist to date calls for such location tracking quite

161
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:03.780
possibly our security theater rather than actual security.

162
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.680
This description ties in neatly with Snyder's framework and our current moment,

163
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:11.220
the players involved in formulating our collective policy for handling

164
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.390
coronavirus include governments at the national state and local levels and

165
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:18.900
businesses ranging in size from giant corporations to your local pizza joint.

166
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.590
These players who have varying levels of power bring to the table,

167
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:26.850
many different agendas in the case of governments to be seen taking action

168
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:29.820
effective or not, and to safeguard a struggling economy.

169
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.720
And in the case of businesses to attract enough customers to turn a profit or at

170
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:35.520
least keep operations going,

171
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.780
perhaps there is no better example of health security theater than the quickly

172
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:44.610
maligned reopening plans of AMC theaters for July as the LA times noted the

173
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:46.410
challenge is not just reopening.

174
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.170
It's getting people comfortable enough to show up.

175
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.770
So the company sought to assuage fears by reducing capacity and spending

176
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:54.960
millions of dollars on sanitation equipment.

177
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.740
While all of those things can reduce the spread of the virus,

178
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.040
the policy that is most effective at keeping people safe, wasn't.

179
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.170
<v 3>On the docket wearing masks.</v>

180
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.930
<v 0>While the company would require employees to wear them,</v>

181
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.610
it would not universally required patrons to that was deemed political,

182
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.670
which is a nice way of saying not good for business.

183
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.150
Although the company reversed course after backlash and stated they would

184
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:22.590
require masks. If I can make a somewhat unscientific analogy,

185
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.840
the sanitation equipment is like that dude,

186
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.350
at the frat party who wanted to write a razor scooter off of a roof telling you

187
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.270
chill, bro, I'll wear a helmet.

188
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.130
And here our imaginary bro reveals a basic danger of security theater,

189
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.840
half measures that make you feel safer about doing something incredibly dumb.

190
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.161
Importantly,

191
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:44.460
we're not here to malign safety measures like wearing helmets or doing

192
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:45.330
temperature checks.

193
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.080
These things are fine so long as they don't give people a false sense of

194
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:53.670
security as they careen headfirst into a traumatic brain injury or so long as

195
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:57.300
they don't pull money and other resources from more impactful safety measures.

196
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.051
After all,

197
00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:01.680
you don't want to spend all your money on seatbelts for a car known to burst

198
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:04.290
into flames. Now AMSE scrapped mask.

199
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:06.810
Policy is not unique as restaurants and bars,

200
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:08.970
tout menu cleaning and waiters clad,

201
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.800
and PPE many are not requiring patrons to wear masks as they amble past other

202
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:17.970
diners, to be fair, some businesses are just trying to do the right thing,

203
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.020
keeping their employees and customers safe while trying to limit layoffs.

204
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.550
But as Schneier observed in the wake of nine 11 self-interest is a powerful

205
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:29.220
force. Even in the midst of a national emergency.

206
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.420
If the best science says that the best way to stay safe is to stay home and to

207
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:36.420
avoid the cheesecake factory. Quite literally like the plague,

208
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.650
it is in the restaurant.

209
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.000
Player's best interest to ignore that data as much as possible. Instead,

210
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:45.600
they might implement relatively less costly security theater measures that give

211
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:49.890
people enough confidence to drown their sorrows and avocado egg rolls jokes

212
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:54.340
aside their recent tragic spikes and infection rates in Texas, Florida,

213
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:58.120
and California demonstrate how security theater can create a gap between the

214
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:02.470
perception of safety and an unsafe reality at its best security theater can be a

215
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.360
useful part of a functioning society,

216
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.110
deterring lesser threats while providing us some day to day peace of mind.

217
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.170
And it's worse though, as a by-product of big players,

218
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.390
desire for a Swift return to normalcy,

219
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.260
it can encourage average people to lower their defenses before it's really safe

220
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:20.170
to do so with devastating consequences.

221
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.290
But what do you think wisecrack or some of the safety measures that we see just

222
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.290
for show or is everyone just scrambling to do the right thing?
