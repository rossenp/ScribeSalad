00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>What's up wisecrack Jared here during these highly unstable times.</v>

2
00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:11.840
One of the few things we can know for certain is that you have recently seen

3
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:12.674
tiger King.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.490
Another certainty is that you can't stop thinking about Joe exotics music

5
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:17.240
videos.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.290
This Netflix show about feuding owners of Genki zoos has dominated our brain

7
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:21.681
space,

8
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:25.550
consumed our weekly all-staff meetings and even resulted in the occasional

9
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.730
Carole Baskin theme. Nightmare. The show is addicting,

10
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.180
baffling and far jucier than any expired.

11
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.720
Wal-Mart meet much of the media attention surrounding tiger King has

12
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.160
appropriately focused on Joe exotic, the endlessly fascinating gun,

13
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.970
toting polyamorous redneck. Now incarcerated big cat owner.

14
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.590
Unsurprisingly he's become something of a cultural icon in his own, right?

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.401
Similarly,

16
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:54.170
his fellow big cat dealer doc Antle has claimed that he's received a wild influx

17
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:58.760
of male and female applicants eager to join his sprawling harem of

18
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.520
scantily clad tiger trainers. Keep in mind,

19
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.650
these folks live and labor in squalor earn somewhere between $0 and way less

20
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:10.700
than minimum wage and still behave like they have the best job in the world.

21
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.230
I'm doing tiger shows.

22
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.770
And while I certainly understand the appeal of becoming besties with a cat that

23
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:20.360
might murder me, I still have so many questions. Like what, why,

24
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.590
how luckily one of our other side obsessions can answer the question of what

25
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:29.330
makes someone like Joe exotic or doc Antle so addicting to Netflix audiences

26
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.900
and wayward teenagers alike, specifically Colts.

27
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.740
Now the word Colt might stir images of barefoot Manson chicks rather than pro

28
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:37.970
bono tiger trainers.

29
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.900
But even if the subjects of tiger King are not running full fledged Colts,

30
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.980
the psychology of cults can do a whole lot to explain how perfectly ordinary

31
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.810
people become unflinchingly,

32
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:52.790
loyal to a guy with a soul patch or someone who changed their last name to

33
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
exotic and above all it poses. The question. Could you, dear viewer,

34
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.430
even wind up training tigers for $0 an hour after all,

35
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:04.340
are we not all susceptible to cult-like behaviors?

36
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.870
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on tiger King as always spoilers ahead

37
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.260
for the most bananas TV show you've seen since going into quarantine,

38
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.690
but before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to this week.

39
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:15.980
Sponsor foot mouse.

40
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.540
<v 0>Science-based gaming mouse made for feet. It's just such a huge advantage,</v>

41
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.630
but it's still all about skill, but malice just raises the stakes.

42
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.490
<v 1>Okay? Yeah. We're not serious.</v>

43
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:28.160
This video is actually sponsored by raid shadow legends.

44

57
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.960
if you submit how haven't seen it,

58
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:19.950
tiger King immerses us in the very weird world of big cat owners.

59
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.600
Primarily Joe exotic,

60
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.010
a Kansas man come Oklahoma and who operates a small zoo for lions,

61
00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:30.540
tigers and other animals that definitely don't belong in cages. The narrative,

62
00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:34.110
which becomes exponentially more bonkers by the minute details,

63
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:36.780
a growing feud between Joe and Carol Baskin,

64
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.040
a devoted lover of animal prints who operates big cat rescue,

65
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.720
a sanctuary apparently dedicated to ending the selling breeding and commercial

66
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:48.240
cuddling of this adorable tiger Cub.

67
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.760
The feud escalates to the point where send your exotic,

68
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.010
apparently hire someone to murder Carol,

69
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.160
and act that combined with his big cat industrial complex,

70
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.860
lands him over two decades in prison,

71
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.650
along the way he acquires three young male husbands,

72
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.910
one of whom dies tragically. Oh, and also Carol's millionaire.

73
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:08.460
Second husband vanishes into thin air.

74
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.100
Also Joe runs the world's weirdest presidential camp.

75
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.200
<v 2>And this is all paid for by the committee of Joe exotic speaks for America.</v>

76
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.650
Okay.

77
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.560
<v 1>Carol runs the world's weirdest Facebook live stream. And again,</v>

78
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.250
doc runs a literal harem. Also the music videos,

79
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.390
so many music videos, some of which honestly,

80
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.990
and please don't roast me for this, or maybe not that bad.

81
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.100
Most of the tiger King cultural discourse has dealt with me modifying Joe exotic

82
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:39.030
and the other cast of absurd characters. What we found most interesting though,

83
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:42.930
wasn't Joe's political aspirations or even Carol's potentially murder his

84
00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:46.830
streak. Rather we're finding ourselves obsessed with the way two of the central

85
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:47.664
characters,

86
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.500
Joe exotic and doc Antle build and maintain their avid followings of low to

87
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.050
no paid workers and fans. That is to say,

88
00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.000
how did these two borderline lunatics effectively become kind of cult-y

89
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.230
before we can prove that Joe exotic is actually Oklahoma's finest cultist to

90
00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:04.980
ever Colt.

91
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.640
We need to look at what defines a cult in the first place as is the case with

92
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.830
most complicated and fascinating things.

93
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.070
The definition of the word cult is notoriously slippery,

94
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.710
which is why people have written entire academic papers.

95
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:19.950
Debating said definition in summation for a long time.

96
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:24.150
The word cult was relatively neutral term associated with conventional religious

97
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:28.740
or spiritual groups, such as a cult of a Roman God. In the 19th century,

98
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:33.000
the word began to develop a pejorative street being used to describe excessive

99
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.880
devotion. As cults became more common in the seventies.

100
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.260
Anti-culture river also Rose and cultural fascination surrounding cult has

101
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:42.960
remained strong sense for ease of understanding.

102
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:46.470
We're going to define Colts by their common characteristics as defined by

103
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.860
psychiatrist and Harvard professor Robert J Lifton in his paper,

104
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.540
cult formation in it.

105
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:55.230
He delineated the three central characteristics of a destructive cult.

106
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.260
These were one a leader to coercive persuasion or

107
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:01.190
thought reform.

108
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.170
I E brainwashing and three economic sexual and other exploitation of

109
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.450
group members by the leader and their inner circle.

110
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.380
We'd argue that the organizations have Joe exotic and doc Antle both exhibit

111
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:13.550
some level of these three.

112
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.600
<v 3>Characteristics. He's got his little coat and I got my letter.</v>

113
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.450
<v 1>When it comes to number one charismatic leaders,</v>

114
00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:23.680
tiger King does not disappoint most notably. Of course we have Joe exotic,

115
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.940
a dude with enough red neck charm to convince not one but two apparently

116
00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:28.601
straight men,

117
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:32.080
young enough to be his son to enter a three-way marriage with him and his

118
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:33.850
glorious Mowat cult leaders,

119
00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:36.310
whether they're Charles Manson or a Kool-Aid slurping,

120
00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:39.310
Jim Jones demand to be the center of attention.

121
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.730
Joe exotic marketed his zoo as his own personal stage.

122
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.740
He thrived on being filmed,

123
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.760
even when said filming was of intensely incriminating acts like threatening

124
00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:50.260
murder, Colt leaders,

125
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:54.640
demand adoration and through a mix of charisma self-confidence and seductive

126
00:06:54.641 --> 00:06:58.750
tendencies inspire and almost pathological devotion in their followers.

127
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.560
It's not surprising that they often take on vaguely religious monikers from

128
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.820
Nixon leader, Keith Raniere, who went by Vanguard to the source family leader,

129
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:07.780
father yod.

130
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.680
It's not just about picking a super cool and not lame at all name like Joe

131
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:12.850
exotic or Bhagavan.

132
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.580
<v 3>Nope. Bhagavan means that you're a friend of God.</v>

133
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.970
<v 1>According to psychotherapists, Daniel Shaw claimed their power.</v>

134
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.250
Vis-a-vis their traumatic narcissism,

135
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.660
which he explains as a version of self-centeredness and self-aggrandizing far

136
00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:29.050
more sinister than anything you could accuse your typical imagine singing

137
00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:32.920
celebrity of for Shaw traumatic narcissism can be summarized as the

138
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:37.060
objectification of one person in a relationship as the means of enforcing the

139
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:40.180
dominance of the subjectivity of the other. That is to say,

140
00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:43.150
when you become involved with a traumatically narcissistic person,

141
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.360
you surrender the right to have your own mind and perspective.

142
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.680
You internalize the narcissists doctrine and worldview and learn to dread

143
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.820
thinking for yourself.

144
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.600
That just about sums up a lot of the relationships we see in tiger King with

145
00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:59.830
both Joe exotic and doc Antle effectively acting as preachers of the sacred

146
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:01.030
gospel of the tiger.

147
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.110
They happily use their charisma and sexual power to take advantage of vulnerable

148
00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:09.400
people under the guise of saving these admittedly amazing animals as all

149
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:13.600
traumatizing narcissists do doc and Joe think that their emotional needs Trump.

150
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.160
<v 3>All others maybe asked me what's wrong, but he only spends five seconds. Listen,</v>

151
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.243
and then he'll walk away.

152
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.590
<v 1>This brings us to point number two, coercive persuasion or thought reform.</v>

153
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.530
This point is a little complicated because for the most part,

154
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:29.050
we don't really see the indoctrination process.

155
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.290
As the followers seem pretty acclimated to hashtag Colt life.

156
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.370
By the time we meet them.

157
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.240
But we do see the implications of that indoctrination in the way Joe and doc

158
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.900
expect their employees to sacrifice everything in order to work toward their

159
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:41.860
designated goal.

160
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.460
Whether that goal is actually saving tigers or merely improving their

161
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:48.130
downtrodden menagerie is, is almost beside the point.

162
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.330
Arguably the best evidence of Joe exotic and doc Antle exquisite hold over their

163
00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.820
followers comes in a few specific moments.

164
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.920
First doc makes his inner circle all changed their names as if to divorce

165
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:02.550
themselves from their prior identities. A common tactic in Colts.

166
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.160
<v 4>China came right after I came.</v>

167
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.210
Her name was Michelle Moshe was named Meredith

168
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.060
Rodney. When I met her, her name was Renee.

169
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.980
I had my name legally changed to Bala for many years,

170
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.590
changing your name. It's a very quick way to change everything else about.

171
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.860
<v 1>Then there's when Joe's employee loses an arm and rather than electing to spend</v>

172
00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:29.300
two years getting reconstructive surgery instead gets it amputated and goes back

173
00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:31.010
to work after five days.

174
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.950
So it was not to hurt the collective cause of saving tigers.

175
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.430
Now here's where things get a little complicated because lots of non culty

176
00:09:37.431 --> 00:09:40.820
people make sacrifices for the greater good think of a protestor,

177
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:44.360
putting themselves in front of a tank or a healthcare worker putting themselves

178
00:09:44.361 --> 00:09:48.290
in harm's way to help their patients. But there's a pretty important difference.

179
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.080
That is the huge discrepancy in who is benefiting from your sacrifice. Sure,

180
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.630
the tigers, but most importantly, Joe and his bank account.

181
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.060
<v 4>Never going to financially recover from.</v>

182
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.630
<v 1>This. And this kind of logic will inform a lot more than just cults,</v>

183
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.370
but we'll get there. Similarly,

184
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:09.080
doc Antle expects the 24 seven work efforts of those unfortunate enough to be in

185
00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:12.650
his harem. Unless of course they're recovering from a boob job.

186
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.780
He coerced them into.

187
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.460
<v 4>They were pushing me to get implants, but.</v>

188
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.000
<v 1>They get away with this. It all comes down to the demographic.</v>

189
00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:24.110
Cult leaders seek out. Typically people who joined Colts are young isolated,

190
00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:26.120
and in transitory moments of their life.

191
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.860
<v 4>I am tall tan.</v>

192
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.380
<v 1>In fact, psychiatrist, John G.</v>

193
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.850
Clark Jr notes that cult leaders will frequent bus stations, airports, campuses,

194
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.230
libraries, rallies,

195
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.220
anywhere that unattached persons are likely to be passing through and act.

196
00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:44.360
We literally see Joe doing when he recruits this woman into his tiger coat in

197
00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:46.400
her onscreen interview, Barbara Fisher notes,

198
00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:50.900
that doc Antle tended to go for women who were virgins that is uninitiated into

199
00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:52.700
the world of sexual relationships,

200
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.100
rendering them far more likely to fall into it.

201
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.060
<v 4>His orbit, there was a certain personality of woman that he wanted.</v>

202
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.250
They were virgins or close to Virgin.

203
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:02.600
<v 1>Leaders.</v>

204
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.800
As traumatic narcissists are notoriously mercurial using their endlessly

205
00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:11.360
vacillating emotions to confuse disorient and manipulate their followers.

206
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.800
We see this with Joe who's narcissism seems only to be augmented when he's on

207
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:18.500
camera. Sometimes he'll be kind and inspiring.

208
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.230
Sometimes he'll lash out cruelly at his employees,

209
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.670
even firing them purely to generate drama like a real housewife on

210
00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:26.540
steroids.

211
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.220
<v 4>Yeah, the slacker and do less than anybody here. Ain't gonna work with me.</v>

212
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.480
So you need to find a new job.

213
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.160
<v 1>Then there's the third criteria,</v>

214
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.050
exploitation of one's followers in economic sexual, and other resorted arenas.

215
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.770
This most commonly occurs when Colt leaders overwork their followers in the

216
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:46.670
Colts family business, whether that means dumpster diving for food,

217
00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:50.450
like a Manson girl or helping to run the multi-level marketing cult, Nexium,

218
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.710
or working as housekeeper for the lesser known divine.

219
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.080
This is doc and Joe to a T.

220
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.070
<v 4>Yeah, but I just work all day. But I'm of like,</v>

221
00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:01.830
it's like a stay home to midnight, 8:00 AM to midnight.

222
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.820
You're working every day.

223
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.310
<v 1>Yeah. Typically, and as we see in tiger King,</v>

224
00:12:05.311 --> 00:12:07.740
these work days are long and grueling,

225
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.410
leaving followers too exhausted to do anything,

226
00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:13.020
but go to sleep and dream about their beloved leaders.

227
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.830
This state of overwork puts their followers in a chronic state of sensory

228
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:20.280
deprivation, which makes them easier to manipulate and control.

229
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.040
Arguably spending 12 hours a day, seven days a week,

230
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:27.150
shoveling tiger poo and manicuring tiger lawns makes you more pliable,

231
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.043
more obedient.

232
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.910
And some cult experts would say can even potentially alter your brain chemistry

233
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.350
on the economic exploitation front. All of these people may close to.

234
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.570
<v 4>How much do people get paid a hundred dollars?</v>

235
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.590
<v 1>Are we enriching their leaders, but also inhibiting their ability to leave.</v>

236
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.570
Then of course, there's the sex stuff.

237
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.650
Joe and doc seemed to exclusively prey on young people who lack solidified

238
00:12:49.651 --> 00:12:51.810
sexual identities and in Joe's case,

239
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.900
even potentially using drugs to coerce them into sex.

240
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.650
When you have a charismatic leader who has separated you from the outside world

241
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.650
and forces you to work hard for almost $0,

242
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.630
can you really be in a willing and healthy sexual relationship? We say, nah,

243
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.300
and most shrinks would probably back us up on this.

244
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.820
So with these three sucky criteria fulfilled,

245
00:13:11.821 --> 00:13:13.980
we're left with one big looming question.

246
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.740
How do these leaders convince their members to stay?

247
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.710
That's where we get to the real nucleus of what makes a cold.

248
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.450
And if it weren't so sad and potentially lethal, it could be kind of beautiful.

249
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.380
Human beings are almost genetically engineered to seek a purpose in life for

250
00:13:28.381 --> 00:13:31.890
centuries. That purpose was primarily realized in mainstream religion,

251
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.820
likely a big reason that cult spring up with such force in 1970s,

252
00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:40.140
America was the downturn of mainstream religiosity that followed the baby boomer

253
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.670
hippie awakening of the sixties.

254
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:46.050
When you lose weekly church sermons about God's love, you need a replacement.

255
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.200
Thousands of Americans found that replacement in Colts,

256
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.550
whether it was the Manson family, Scientology, children of God or so on.

257
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.720
Each of these groups featured a charismatic leader who offered critically a

258
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.450
purpose to their followers for the Manson family.

259
00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:04.170
That purpose was free love with a side of race war for Scientology.

260
00:14:04.171 --> 00:14:07.650
It was advancing through bogus classes until you could learn even more bogus

261
00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:08.790
secrets of the universe.

262
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.690
<v 4>He'd say the fifth invaders are up there and this is how they addressed.</v>

263
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.583
This is how they.

264
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.910
<v 1>For the heaven's gate cult.</v>

265
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.020
It was the promise of transcendence into an extraterrestrial spacecraft for Jim

266
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:20.850
Jones's unfortunate followers.

267
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.450
It was the doctrine of so-called revolutionary suicide.

268
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.630
And if you're a tiger trainer at the ritzy Myrtle beach Safari,

269
00:14:27.631 --> 00:14:29.340
or the jenky GW zoo,

270
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.870
you are following the gospel of saving the tigers as noble as that goal may

271
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:34.710
actually be.

272
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.370
And Joe exotic especially makes a borderline convincing case for that goal in

273
00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:39.780
the early episodes of the show,

274
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.310
expressing a genuine desire to save big cats from extinction via shopping mall,

275
00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:47.820
cuddling sessions, achieving a higher purpose is lovely.

276
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.700
We wish it for all of you, but please God,

277
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.670
not at the expense of your favorite arm.

278
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.390
Of course we haven't really dealt with Carol basket and who is almost certainly

279
00:14:56.391 --> 00:15:00.950
not a cult leader that said she does exhibit a culty characteristic here and

280
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:05.930
there most notably unexpecting her volunteers to work long grueling hours for $0

281
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:06.860
in devotion to her car.

282
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.140
<v 0>I don't pay anybody to do animal care because people will do that for free.</v>

283
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.770
<v 1>So her whole uniform thing is pretty much textbook Colt material.</v>

284
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.970
<v 0>Volunteers wear a color coded shirt system after they've been here for like five</v>

285
00:15:18.971 --> 00:15:22.420
years or so, they can graduate to a master keeper and that's blue.

286
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.210
That's a Navy blue there's Royal blue.

287
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.660
<v 1>You can find an exact analogy in Nexium,</v>

288
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.480
which ranked its member status by colored sashes.

289
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.690
Obviously being stoked about your uniform doesn't mean you're in a cult,

290
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.950
but the members' devotion to a rigid hierarchy as decreed by Carol indicates a

291
00:15:38.951 --> 00:15:40.870
certain subservience to her mission.

292
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.430
Of course it's worth asking aren't some of these tactics say of bullying people

293
00:15:45.431 --> 00:15:49.870
into changing their behavior employed in say your local CrossFit class,

294
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.770
aren't you basically paying to work for your local improv theater or go over

295
00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:58.540
$500 for an advanced class that includes performing for paying audiences.

296
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.380
What about multi-level marketing schemes that extensively offer you meaning and

297
00:16:02.381 --> 00:16:06.970
economic emancipation so long as you're willing to buy $20,000 worth of tie dyed

298
00:16:06.971 --> 00:16:07.540
leggings,

299
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.080
we'd argued that the incessant human quest for meaning is capable of being

300
00:16:11.081 --> 00:16:15.550
exploited by any charismatic leader in almost every area of human life.

301
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.480
Even that of certain YouTube celebs though, we certainly won't name names,

302
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.560
whether we're prostrating ourselves to the SoulCycle instructor or dedicating

303
00:16:23.561 --> 00:16:26.920
our lives to climbing up the ranks of a multi-level vitamin company,

304
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.180
we're all guilty of subsuming our independence and the name of a common goal.

305
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.690
Often while being marshaled by the words of a seductive leader,

306
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.810
even if our life isn't being run by a traumatic narcissist,

307
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:41.380
we're all capable of being whipped into cult-like frenzies.

308
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.700
And it's certainly not a bad thing to find a cause you believe in unless you

309
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:46.870
lose your autonomy.

310
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.260
There's a difference between volunteering for doctors without borders versus

311
00:16:50.261 --> 00:16:53.320
moving to spawn ranch with Charles Manson. But you know,

312
00:16:53.321 --> 00:16:55.720
if a guy with a mullet offers you a trailer to live in,

313
00:16:55.721 --> 00:16:57.730
in exchange for a lifetime of servitude,

314
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.900
maybe just try to find meaning in your local fantasy football league instead

315
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.040
hell I'd even recommend soul cycle. But what do you think wisecrack,

316
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.880
are we reading too much into the gospel of Joe exotic and doc Antle or are they

317
00:17:09.881 --> 00:17:14.140
fully 100% Colt material? And is the search for meaning inherent in all of us,

318
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.140
a big part of what makes tiger King so addictive,

319
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.670
let us know which thing in the comments,

320
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.540
