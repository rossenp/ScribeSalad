00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>This episode is brought to you by Ridge wallet.</v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.050
What's up guys, Jared here,

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.080
if you've checked Twitter or turned on the news recently,

4
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:13.550
you might've noticed a theme.

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.430
We are seeing president Trump's odds of reelection,

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.970
starting to dwindle quite significantly. And this'll be over by,

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.290
by January one way or the other.

8
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.940
<v 1>So from the consumer side, very, very strong. And that's really a driver of, uh,</v>

9
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:28.730
of, of the overall profit economic forecast.

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.150
<v 0>How far will COVID spread? Who's going to win the election.</v>

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.770
When will the economy crash?

12
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.430
There's no shortage of people who claim to have hacked the future in the

13
00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:37.910
seventies.

14
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.970
People claim they could predict the stock market based on who won the super

15
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:43.850
bowl. And you don't need to think that far back to remember this.

16
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.840
<v 1>Republicans are not going to win this next election or this that the Corona</v>

17
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:52.760
virus will follow the same path and go away with the arrival of warmer weather

18
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.720
in the summer, or who.

19
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.760
<v 0>Can forget Jim Cramer with this doozy.</v>

20
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.110
<v 1>Should I be worried about barristers in terms of liquidity and get my money out</v>

21
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.190
there? No, no, no.

22
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.470
<v 0>Right before 2008 financial crash.</v>

23
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.180
<v 1>It was the worst day on wall street. Since the crash of 1987.</v>

24
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.010
<v 0>Surrounded by very bad predictions, whether they're from your uncle teachers,</v>

25
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:16.040
news, personalities, even people with fancy degrees.

26
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.750
So what can you do to not fall for the snake oil of charming political punditry

27
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.890
and who can you believe welcome to this wisecrack edition on predictions?

28
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.000
What do they know? Do they know things let's find out, but before we continue,

29
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.310
I want to give a shout out to our sponsors over at Ridge.

30
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.240
The Ridge is a light and sleek wallet that is designed to help you get rid of

31
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:36.980
your old lumpy leather wallet.

32
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.620
The Ridge wallet is the last wallet you may ever need.

33
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:44.270
Since each one is made from extremely durable materials like carbon fiber, Burt,

34
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.430
titanium, and aluminum. In fact,

35
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:49.490
they're so durable that each wallet comes with a lifetime warranty.

36
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.640
It holds up to 12 cards and still has room for cash.

37
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.210
And the best part is that it's made with RFID blocking technology.

38
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.570
So you're protected from digital pickpockets. I love that.

39
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:03.590
It's just so slim and I don't have to go out with awkward dad pockets.

40
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:07.010
Every time I want to go to the store, it also looks really stylish.

41
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.820
You can get your own wallet and over 30 different colors and styles. Right now,

44
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.490
And now back to the show, let me start by introducing you to Philip Tetlock,

45
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.540
a psychologist who has spent much of his career studying political forecasting.

46
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.580
Over 20 years, he tracked 80,000 predictions made by almost 300 people.

47
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.020
All of whom made a living,

48
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:36.140
offering insights into the future of politics and the economy.

49
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.260
And what he found was well, pretty terrible.

50
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.650
Ted luck measured the predictions that could be put on some kind of scale,

51
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:46.700
like will there be more of something less of something or will it stay the same?

52
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.480
Today's version of these predictions might sound like will the war in Syria get

53
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:55.280
better worsen or stay the same one might also predictive support for Donald

54
00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.130
Trump or Joe Biden. Respectively will increase decrease Oregon stay the same.

55
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.640
You might expect someone with a political science background to Excel here,

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.520
armed with facts. They could confidently forecast.

57
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.840
What's going to happen in Syria. I, on the other hand might wildly guess a,

58
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:14.020
B or C, but here's the thing. According to Tetlock,

59
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.440
I'd probably beat most of the experts. That's right.

60
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.790
Tetlock's professional predictors of the world were generally less accurate than

61
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:26.530
random chance or monkeys throwing darts or Jared Bauer wildly guessing on a

62
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:31.240
history exam. However you want to think about it. So screw the experts.

63
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.050
Well,

64
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.890
not quite Tetlock is quick to point out that while people have taken his study

65
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:39.670
to mean that there are no trustworthy experts. That's not the case.

66
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.820
They're just a small minority, but it gets worse.

67
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.890
Tetlock found one specific kind of expert among his study. The bold predictors,

68
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.730
people who have a theory of how the world works are completely sure of that

69
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:56.650
theory and make daring big predictions. Tetlock calls these people hedgehogs,

70
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.110
and to put it bluntly. They're the worst.

71
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.770
<v 2>I want nachos and Buffalo wings. Oh, and guac.</v>

72
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.611
<v 0>And where it isn't,</v>

73
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:05.940
it let's look at political commentator and famous hedgehog bill.

74
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.570
Kristol a man who makes his living writing and talking about the news.

75
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.240
He predicted Iraq would be a two-month war.

76
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.220
<v 2>From his is going to be a two on four. And.</v>

77
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.140
<v 0>That Barack Obama would not win a single primary over Hillary Clinton on 2015</v>

78
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:20.730
amidst the Republican campaigns.

79
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.590
He had proclaimed peak Trump no less than 11 times. And bill crystal,

80
00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:29.190
despite all of this has a thriving career on cable news.

81
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.400
Crystal's bad predictions. Aren't an ideological issue.

82
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.480
Tetlock found bold predicting hedgehogs equally on the left and the right,

83
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.250
but get ready. A storm is coming.

84
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.340
So they tended towards the more extreme ends of each spectrum.

85
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.790
And it's not just that crystal and people like him are dumb dumbs on TV who

86
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:48.660
don't know anything Tetlock found as a hedgehog's knowledge increases about a

87
00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:52.620
specific topic, their prediction, accuracy worsens. From here,

88
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:55.800
we can immediately understand the problem about some of the bolder COVID

89
00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:58.380
predictions that it would definitely fizzle out by April.

90
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.760
<v 2>And that outbreak will reach its highest point. In the second week of April.</v>

91
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.390
<v 0>That hydroxy chloroquine was a wonder drug before we all had the data,</v>

92
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.530
very powerful drug.

93
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.580
These so-called experts stand in stark contrast to the people we should actually

94
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:13.200
be listening to 10 Luxe.

95
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.890
Other kind of expert is a lot less interesting to listen to than hedgehogs like

96
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:20.340
Jim Cramer or bill crystal Tetlock calls them foxes.

97
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.980
They were experts who had hem and haw about the future.

98
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.190
Considering a wide variety of data points and perspectives.

99
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.700
<v 3>Blueberry muffin for ya. Uh, I don't know, baby.</v>

100
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.630
I can't decide you're right there, mate. Okay. I've made my decision.

101
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.860
I want to start currently.

102
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.840
<v 0>Not exactly crystal balls,</v>

103
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.350
but they have a better track record than the hedgehogs. Unlike hedgehogs,

104
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.290
they become more accurate as the accumulate more knowledge,

105
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.340
but most of the time foxes don't exactly make for entertaining cable news

106
00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:50.880
guests.

107
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.200
After all what's more fun and expert predicting a landslide election that will

108
00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:59.180
forever change the nation or someone who likes to dive into the countless

109
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.660
variables and uncertainty before just shrugging their shoulders and declaring

110
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.570
that there's not enough data, but what about COVID predictions?

111
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.960
I'm not talking about pundits on CNN. I'm talking about the scientist.

112
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.760
It seems that even listening to them,

113
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.480
they're always changing their minds about how many people will get sick or die,

114
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.040
or these just talking heads,

115
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.730
making big bold predictions with absolutely no scrutiny.

116
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.740
Not quite obviously holding people accountable for they were wrong about is fine

117
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.310
and good, but to understand why COVID predictions are always changing.

118
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.470
And for good reason, I want to talk about.

119
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.610
<v 4>48 Degrees in the upper Northwest and 38 degrees in the middle</v>

120
00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:37.630
East. We're actually.

121
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.460
<v 0>Very good at predicting the weather.</v>

122
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.120
So let's talk about it with a little bit of a dumbed down model. Generally,

123
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:46.120
if there's a 90% chance of rain for a specific area,

124
00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:50.470
it will rain nine times out of 10 and won't rain one out of 10 times.

125
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.200
And because meteorologists are constantly making predictions,

126
00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:56.470
we can scrutinize their track record and they can improve upon it.

127
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.830
Things get more complicated when you forecast for large areas,

128
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.780
like when part of a city has a 100% chance of rain and the other half has a 40%

129
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:07.990
chance. These probabilities will often get mushed together. But again,

130
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.840
we're working with the very basic unit of forecasting.

131
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.410
The important thing for weather predicting is that it relies on a model of how

132
00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:18.760
the weather works. A model is like your kindergarten arts and crafts project,

133
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.481
a smaller,

134
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:23.410
more manageable representation of a much bigger and complicated reality.

135
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.280
In the case of a meteorologist their model might include wind patterns and

136
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:28.061
pressure fronts,

137
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:31.810
and how these interact to figure out how likely it is that a storm system will

138
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:34.000
ruin my dog pageant, importantly,

139
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.780
weather models and all models rely on assumptions models,

140
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:41.530
make assumptions about which variables matter and prioritize them over others to

141
00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:45.730
figure out a very specific outcome. Weather predictions, assume for instance,

142
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:50.170
that YouTube trending videos won't influence a Stormfront and for good reason,

143
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.330
COVID models do the same. For example,

144
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:54.220
they might be less interested in the variable,

145
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:57.700
how many wisecracks subscribers a state has and more interested in the

146
00:07:57.701 --> 00:07:59.680
percentage of people who are social distancing,

147
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.370
predicting rain is a yes or no outcome that could be given a specific

148
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:04.540
probability. However,

149
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:08.260
when it comes to COVID where the total number of cases can be anywhere from zero

150
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:10.030
to approximately 8 billion,

151
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.260
it's a little less helpful and a lot harder to say there is a 1 billion of a

152
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:18.310
percent chance that exactly 37 people will get infected. Instead,

153
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:20.710
epidemiologists use confidence intervals,

154
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.850
which is a fancy way of saying I'm 95% confident.

155
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.950
The amount of new cases will be between this number and that number,

156
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.060
but like the weather.

157
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.240
There's also the understanding that the real number could fall outside.

158
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:33.880
That range 5% of the time. And importantly,

159
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.000
that number range rests on a lot of assumptions.

160
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.930
Assumptions about how infectious, the diseases, the percentage of infections,

161
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:44.170
mask usage could decrease. How many States will enter lockdown?

162
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:45.550
How well will they enforce it?

163
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.090
Will people in Florida start having COVID parties to spread the disease.

164
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.440
Unsurprisingly, getting every assumption, right, is a pre Herculean task,

165
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.690
especially when talking about finicky humans as statistician George E-box

166
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:59.490
writes, all models are wrong.

167
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.150
The practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.

168
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.920
And unlike our weather system,

169
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.730
disease outbreaks involve people who can be influenced by your prediction and

170
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.730
completely upend your assumptions. If your model says,

171
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.910
this will all be over next week with the assumption that everyone will stay in

172
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:15.420
doors,

173
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.080
my friends and I might declare an early victory and resume our normal practice

174
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:22.920
of licking. The fresh produce at whole foods. Don't do this. You know,

175
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.730
something that undermines the models, assumptions, hypothetical society.

176
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.360
One example of assumptions gone wrong can be seen in the much reported

177
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:35.130
prediction in April that Corona virus deaths would virtually stop in the summer.

178
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.180
This model put out by the Institute for health metrics and evaluation made one

179
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:43.290
assumption that was lambasted by other public health experts that the United

180
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.770
States curve of cases would resemble that of countries like China and Italy.

181
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.701
In some ways,

182
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:51.990
this is exactly what modeling is about condensing the complicated information

183
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:53.700
into a graspable proxy,

184
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.060
but it also rests on the assumption that the state and federal governments would

185
00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:01.080
act in a comparable way to other governments that people would wear masks in a

186
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:02.700
similar fashion, et cetera.

187
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.210
And as you may have guessed America doesn't act like other countries.

188
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.810
I don't mean to compare the I M H E here to hedgehogs on the news though,

189
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.590
making wrong assumptions. Shouldn't cast someone into prediction hell,

190
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.820
unless they do so time after time without ever pausing for reflection.

191
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.670
Unfortunately, this is what some media outlets will have.

192
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:24.870
You believe that changing a prediction is a sign of an intellectual failure.

193
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:25.621
For instance,

194
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:29.040
a model from Imperial college London projected that without drastic

195
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:33.420
interventions, more than half a million Britains would die from COVID-19 later,

196
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:37.290
the scientists who led the modeling team said he expected deaths in the UK to

197
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.610
top out at 20,000.

198
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.921
<v 5>The talent is,</v>

199
00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:44.570
would be probably unlikely to exceed about 20,000 with a effective

200
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.440
devil.

201
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.860
<v 0>This caused one reporter to call it a remarkable turn on Twitter.</v>

202
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.550
While the daily mail ran a story on the scientist patchy record and the

203
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.270
Federalists declared that he just walked back the apocalyptic prediction.

204
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.140
But of course there was no changing course as the Imperial college model

205
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:03.980
predicted multiple outcomes based on different assumptions. In this case,

206
00:11:03.981 --> 00:11:08.210
the scary number was always the government does nothing assumption in the 20,000

207
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:12.050
dead was under the drastic government intervention assumption. And of course,

208
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.520
any models Imperial college or otherwise should change their estimates as more

209
00:11:16.521 --> 00:11:20.270
data pours in about transmission rate of the disease about if reinfection as

210
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:21.740
possible and so on.

211
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.700
And here is the Mark of a good predictor and someone who likely isn't as

212
00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:26.960
entertaining on TV,

213
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.800
a person who understands their assumptions about how they might possibly go

214
00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:34.490
wrong. It's also why you should listen to data scientists about COVID numbers,

215
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.130
even after they allegedly changed their minds.

216
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.940
Even the current IMH prediction tool, which is publicly available,

217
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.080
lets you tweak for certain assumptions like the easing of lockdowns or

218
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:46.490
widespread mask usage.

219
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.300
A similar problem exists in media coverage of climate change scientists

220
00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:54.370
constantly set forth scenarios that often range from best case to worst case

221
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.490
based on government policies or economic growth. For example,

222
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.450
while trying to iron out all the kinks of how our insanely complicated weather

223
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:03.970
system works. When these predictions are revised,

224
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.310
people often criticize them for being wrong.

225
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.510
Instead of lauding the scientists behind them for doing their job box wrote that

226
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.190
since all models are wrong,

227
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.550
the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong.

228
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.850
And whether you're making advanced computer models are just trying to give

229
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:21.010
better advice. The steps are the same.

230
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.130
You predict see the results and adjust the formula.

231
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.580
And therein lies the problem with people like crystal or whoever is giving you

232
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:31.180
pandemic hot takes on Twitter. There's no iterative process.

233
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.100
There's no accountability.

234
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.970
As Tetlock writes more often than not forecasts are made.

235
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.950
And then nothing accuracy is seldom determined after the fact every day,

236
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:46.210
the news media delivers forecasts without reporting or even asking how good the

237
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:48.790
forecasters who made the forecast really are.

238
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.740
So what should we do well for one avoid TV and maybe even

239
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:54.370
YouTube,

240
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.390
try to figure out when people are predicting for sport like on TV and if they

241
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:01.990
have any incentive at all to revise their bold proclamations when they're

242
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:04.630
incessantly wrong, most people don't.

243
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.680
And I would predict the world would be a much better place if we listened to

244
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:13.300
them a little less frequently. But what do I know? What do you guys think?

245
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.990
How can we ever know who to trust? Let us know in the comments. Huge,
