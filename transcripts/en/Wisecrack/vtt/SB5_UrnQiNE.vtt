00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.250
<v 0>This video is brought to you by keeps.</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.790
<v 1>Hey, wisecrack, Michael here. Obvious today,</v>

3
00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:14.570
we're here to unpack the film with the absolute grossest sound design,

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.500
the platform this sleeper hit,

5
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:21.080
which premiered in 2019 and came to Netflix in 2020,

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.800
intrigued a lot of people as they slipped into their own personal socially

7
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.280
distance. Tell the film seems made for wisecrack. A simple,

8
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:32.270
gross premise as political allegory is basically as irresistible to us as an

9
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:34.820
all. You can eat taco buffet, but I wouldn't be here.

10
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:38.150
If there wasn't something bothering me about this film specifically,

11
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.070
is it as smart as it thinks it is?

12
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.920
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on the platform.

13
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.680
Is it deep or dumb and spoilers.

14
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.573
<v 0>Ahead.</v>

15
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.000
<v 1>But before we continue, I want to give a shout out to this week.</v>

16
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:54.200
Sponsor keeps I love wearing hats. They're pretty much part of my identity.

17
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.320
You probably feel the same way about your hair. It's something people recognize,

18
00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:59.150
and it's probably one way you express yourself.

19
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.020

Stop stressing and keep your hair. Now back to the show,

33
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.670
the platform follows the young idealist scoring and a vertical self-management

34
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:50.990
center, which is bureaucratic.

35
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:54.740
Speak for a food themed purge prison inside the concrete walls.

36
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.230
Anything goes well, almost anything.

37
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.100
<v 2>[Inaudible] I still want you to call me.</v>

38
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.760
<v 1>Hello.</v>

39
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.150
Prisoners are free to be as gluttonous as possible on their fellow inmates,

40
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:12.380
murder them, eat them,

41
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.230
or do none of the above and just chill out with a good book.

42
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.850
While all of this is happening.

43
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:20.510
Prisoners are served food once a day through a floating dumbwaiter containing

44
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.170
elegant,

45
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.160
even decadent dishes as the dumbwaiter makes its way through each of the levels

46
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:26.420
of the very tall prison.

47
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.470
The tasty feast is quickly consumed and defiled by the prisoners closest to the

48
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:34.790
top until nothing is left for the prisoners below the basic message.

49
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.610
The film doesn't need a wisecrack breakdown to Dakota.

50
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.430
The prison allegedly makes enough food to feed everyone.

51
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:43.700
But the greed of those at the top condemns those at the bottom to die from

52
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:46.430
starvation. Get it it's capitalism. Now,

53
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.000
if the film were just this and get a big old dumb from us,

54
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.840
believe it or not pay Nicholas cage to look into a camera and whisper.

55
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.760
The only thing you have to lose is your chains is not enough for a wisecrack

56
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.740
deep certification,

57
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.860
nor does having a guy that kind of looks like Jesus at times,

58
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:06.100
or a 333 story building with two prisoners per floor,

59
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:09.220
which means there are 666 people,

60
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.340
but there is more to this film than that, right?

61
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.970
We're going to focus on a couple of things here, the symbolism,

62
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.080
the use of donkey Otay, and last but not least the Oso confusing ending.

63
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.190
So let's start with the symbolism. As director Goldberg has Taylor,

64
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.990
Tia has stated the film is not a social critique, but a social self-criticism.

65
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.990
In other words, it doesn't just take shots at those in power,

66
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.400
but regular old folks like us, the viewer Goren the idealist and trimmer.

67
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.750
GoSee the cynic represent two sides of our consciousness, light Treme GoSee.

68
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:42.610
We are self concerned realists.

69
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.870
<v 2>Again, [inaudible].</v>

70
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.920
<v 1>Like wherein we like to pretend we're above such selfishness.</v>

71
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.060
This seems to relate to the basic idea that in a hyper competitive society,

72
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.640
we all run the risk of acting like cannibalistic monsters as God's Tulu or

73
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.580
tortilla argues.

74
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.480
Perhaps there are individuals who would give up their position voluntarily to

75
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:09.270
achieve a more egalitarian society. However,

76
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.890
we're the group that should give in.

77
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.880
That's very difficult to collectively agree on. We are all selfish,

78
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.170
but there are some among us who are very selfish. The latter, the most selfish,

79
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.430
like the fuse and the fire of selfishness spreads easily among the others.

80
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.180
Now we can sit here and decode little details. For example,

81
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:31.530
the woman who sent Guerin to the prison has no idea what the prison is like an

82
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:35.550
allegory for how those who manage society have no idea about the basic

83
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:39.180
conditions they're condemning others to face or how the delicate artful

84
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:43.170
presentation of the food is meant to represent our obsession with all the luxury

85
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:46.890
capitalism produces while what's left for the vast majority of the world's

86
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:50.940
population is abject poverty, but we're not the first to even mentioned this.

87
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:51.774
So let's move.

88
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.600
<v 2>Books and stuff.</v>

89
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.640
<v 1>Civically Gordon's new favorite book,</v>

90
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.050
Don Quixote with the help of arguably the world's first modern novel,

91
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.980
we can better understand this symbolism and a whole lot more Goran,

92
00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:07.740
like all prisoners in the film gets to bring one item,

93
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.100
but rather than bringing a gun or a creative vitamins, like a smart person,

94
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.010
he brings Miguel de Cervantes, the ingenious gentlemen,

95
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.420
donkey Quixote of Lamancha.

96
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.260
Now most people were called donkey Otay as the story of a delusional man who

97
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:21.480
gets into fights with windmills thinking they're giants.

98
00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:23.280
And while that is important,

99
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:26.670
some of the basic overarching themes of the novel can actually help us

100
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:30.090
understand what the film is trying to say. Alonzo Hano,

101
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.130
alias donkey Otay is an elderly Spanish nobleman who reads so many books that

102
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:39.050
his brain begins to rot. Specifically. He reads tales of chivalry.

103
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.140
He becomes obsessed with the nobler lost past and vendors out on a delusional

104
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:46.440
journey. As a night errand, he sets out to rescue a rando peasant,

105
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.460
who he deems a damsel in distress and randomly names her Dulcinea because why

106
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.150
now he also fights windmills thinking they're giants and declares his Squire

107
00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:56.160
Sancho Panza governor of some Island.

108
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.010
Now one clear parallel to these delusional journeys is Mahari a woman who once a

109
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:05.300
month kills her cellmate and goes on a quest Mahara isn't in search of chivalry,

110
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.090
but a child who we're told doesn't actually exist,

111
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.880
except that child is real allegedly,

112
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.130
but I digress in the film.

113
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:17.150
It's unclear what the hell is going on in society that leads Goran to

114
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.910
voluntarily send himself to prison to earn a degree,

115
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.680
but that's exactly what happens.

116
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.890
And he hopes to quit smoking and to read Don Quixote along the way,

117
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.340
we don't know a whole lot about Grenz literary habits otherwise,

118
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.030
but he starts off his journey like Don Quixote has an idealist,

119
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.480
but rather than chasing delusional visions of fighting monsters and saving

120
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:36.590
damsels in distress,

121
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.050
he's motivated by the delusion that basic human goodness and decency can prevail

122
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.060
in a trash castle like the whole, but as the film progresses,

123
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:47.960
he slowly stripped of these illusions after trying to get others to cooperate by

124
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.280
eating reasonable portions.

125
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.630
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

126
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.340
<v 1>He's promptly accused of being a communist and watches his cellmate</v>

127
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.080
on the prisoners below them like donkey Otay grin also loses his mind in a more

128
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:10.780
literal sense. Vis-a-vis trippy hallucinations,

129
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.640
but instead of ideas of chivalry,

130
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.390
he's haunted by reminders of the horrible things he's done and witnessed in the

131
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:20.350
prison after co murdering and eating his first cellmate Goren scores,

132
00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:22.720
a spot on a higher level of the prison here.

133
00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:27.160
He returns to his former ideas of nobleness and human decency this time though,

134
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:27.551
he does.

135
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:31.450
So with the awareness that spontaneous solidarity as his new cellmate describes

136
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.530
is a sham.

137
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.920
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

138
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.670
<v 1>The only way to make his fellow prisoners more generous to those below them is</v>

139
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.110
to literally threaten them with.

140
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.210
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

141
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.510
<v 1>After going back down, eating another roommate, but this time with no murder.</v>

142
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:54.880
And once again, landing a spot on a higher floor,

143
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.750
grin enters a second kind of quixotic journey. He meets his own Sancho,

144
00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:02.440
Panza Baja Herat, and they decided to go on a quest to the bottom of the prison.

145
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.420
Their mission is first to feed everyone,

146
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.260
but then they get another idea in their head to deliver a message to the

147
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:09.094
administration.

148
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.930
We're not the animals you think we are by violently enforcing a portion control

149
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:16.030
and preserving a single panacotta dish.

150
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.300
They will prove the nobility of their spirit to the people in charge of the

151
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:20.950
prison. LA panacotta.

152
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.960
<v 2>Elements.</v>

153
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.430
<v 1>Of course, the sense of nobility,</v>

154
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:28.030
much like donkey IOTs as quickly undercut as a montage of skull,

155
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:32.050
batching and sues. So pretty deep, but that gets us to the end,

156
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:34.240
which is kind of a giant WTF.

157
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.560
But a brief note on Don Quixote will help us understand this puzzling finale,

158
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.500
which kicks off when grin and Bahar rat find mirrors.

159
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.290
Wasn't supposed to exist child at the bottom of the prison.

160
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.740
After some hesitancy, they decide to feed her their prized dessert,

161
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.060
which is to say all their skull bashing was maybe for nothing Goran and Bahar

162
00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:55.410
rats, obsessive mantra that the panacotta is the message changes.

163
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.360
Gran wakes up from a dream realizing the girl is the message.

164
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.090
And he descends with her to the dark depths of the prison.

165
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.110
The ghost of Treme GoSee paraphrase is a donkey de passage in which the goofy

166
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.080
night remarks DeSanto about how intertwined their fates are.

167
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.503
<v 3>[Inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

168
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.823
[inaudible] [inaudible].

169

<v 1>Grin sends her back up to the top of the platform while walking into the</v>

170
00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:26.900
shadows, a Treme GoSee. He is presumably very much dead, but on the bright side,

171
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:30.350
he has quit smoking. Here's what Maddix and donkey Otay.

172
00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:33.830
The protagonist eventually gives up his delusions, renouncing chivalry,

173
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:35.360
and dying in a fevered state.

174
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.860
One way to read the finale is this Goran has also given up his delusions,

175
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.580
his nobility,

176
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.420
or more specifically that he can prove his humanity to the administration by

177
00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:46.370
sending them back their treasured panacotta.

178
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.010
Instead he opts for a another message.

179
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.540
It's you who are the real monsters and here's the proof a child whom those in

180
00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:56.240
charge claimed would never be confined in their hellhole.

181
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.590
The takeaway of the film seems to be this oftentimes oppressed folks,

182
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.680
try to prove their own humanity to their oppressors. However,

183
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.000
perhaps their strategy should actually be to prove the inhumanity of their

184
00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:12.290
oppressors. And it's a nice thought thought-provoking defin.

185
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.150
So is the film deep or dumped on the literary symbolism? It's pretty deep.

186
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.230
The filmmaker uses the themes of donkey Otay in a novel and thoughtful way, but,

187
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.213
and I'm sorry,

188
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.330
I can't stop from thinking that lots about this movie is kind of dunk with

189
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.240
typologies to the director, chatty with the wisecrack crew,

190
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.210
there was a general sense that this movie was too on the nose,

191
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.810
which is to say a little bit too precisely resembling something.

192
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:39.350
I could probably read on Twitter for most of the film, the messages,

193
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.800
if we could all stop being greedy, there'd be enough food for everyone.

194
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.520
It's not that I disagree with the message, but it's hardly a revelation.

195
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.390
If I can give a more theoretical framework on the nosiness is to social

196
00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:54.500
commentary, what fans services to franchise movies, moments, characters,

197
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:57.980
and dialogue that are meant to have us nod along and say, ah, yes,

198
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.930
this speaks to me and star Wars.

199
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.680
It's seen a recycled Han solo lines spark a sense of nostalgia without any of

200
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:06.500
the narrative way to the original more broadly in media.

201
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.100
It's when old ideas are recycled to spark a sense of agreement without any of

202
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:11.000
the provocation.

203
00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:14.720
That idea once originally had I'm sure the first person who said sharing is

204
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:15.920
caring was really smart,

205
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.880
but your kindergarten teacher is no Dostoevsky for saying so it's not that this

206
00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:22.340
makes those ideas inherently good or bad,

207
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.240
but good art furthers the conversation. Instead of putting it on a loop,

208
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.190
consider a film like Snowpiercer,

209
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.990
which also takes a horrible stratified society as a gift rather than the lower

210
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.050
classes over throwing their cruel overlords and cheering.

211
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.220
Bong Joon home makes us ask really hard questions like does the system secretly

212
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:44.180
want revolt? Is society designed to make suffering inevitable?

213
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.230
It also shows us the logic of those in power Tilda Swinton's character is

214
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:49.700
certifiably bonkers,

215
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.130
but seems to be a real believer with her own fears and the conductor that keeps

216
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:57.400
the nightmare chugging along has his own very logical reasons for being a

217
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:02.110
monster. He truly thinks that's the only way for humanity to survive and to the

218
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.350
platform's credit. I do think the ending kind of gets to this,

219
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.190
but at the message really is show the people in power, what monsters they are.

220
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.670
It's hard to do since they barely have any screen time. Does it work?

221
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:16.000
Are they swayed? It's obviously meant to be ambiguous and revealing.

222
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:18.940
The answer would have been totally weird given the prior absence,

223
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.540
but as far as the basic idea, if 2020 has taught me anything,

224
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:26.110
it's that oftentimes reality doesn't dictate political discourse.

225
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.190
So my final assessment, there are certainly some smarts to this movie,

226
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.380
but it's no masterpiece, but it tried.

227
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:35.170
And for that to cast crew and director deserve all the Panna,

228
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.460
cottas their heart's desire.

229
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.210
And I'm legitimately excited to see what guests Taylor [inaudible] plans on

230
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:43.480
doing next. What do you think? Or we just do crash it either.

231
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.540
Everybody is bombed Juno or Nicholas cage at this point.

232
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.430
