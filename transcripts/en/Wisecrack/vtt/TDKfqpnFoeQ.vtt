<v 0>This video is brought to you by surf shark VPN.</v>

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.360
Hey, wisecrack Michael here and today, we're talking about the boys.

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.320
The show is sadistic and hilarious and has plenty to say about the superheros

4
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:18.590
genre and modern day America. But as we watch season two,

5
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:22.700
we kept coming back to one question. Are any of these characters for real,

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.930
when Stormfront or Billy or Homeland or talk about things they extensively care

7
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.050
about? Are they just faking it? And if so, why?

8
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:34.370
All the posturing let's find out in this wisecrack edition on the boys season

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.800
two, and of course spoilers ahead.

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.770
But before we get into it,

11
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:42.950
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor surf shark VPN.

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.880
It's no secret that you don't have much privacy on the internet these days.

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.030
However, there is a way that you can protect yourself online,

14
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:51.830
and that is by using a VPN,

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.770
a VPN sends your information through an encrypted tunnel.

16
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.590
So you can safely use your passwords without the fear of hackers,

17
00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:58.700
stealing your information.

18
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.350
A VPN can also protect you from targeted ads and to other pesky data trackers.

19
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.460
When you use search shark VPN, you can use your account on any of your devices.

27
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.850
And now for a quick recap,

28
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.230
the boys is the story of when Billy butcher and his crew of vigilante misfits

29
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.630
were trying to take down the Vaught corporation,

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.370
a very evil company that employs and contracts out the services of often

31
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.600
evil superheroes.

32
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.530
<v 1>What happens if, um, I dunno, I do this.</v>

33
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.090
You're just another useless blind guy.

34
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.190
<v 0>It's important to note that these superheroes aren't some happy accident rip to</v>

35
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:04.340
Bob Ross, but the result of bots, very secretive,

36
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.280
definitely illegal medical experiments on children.

37
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.840
The boys try to expose vaunt and save Billy's wife and her child from their head

38
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:16.130
soup Homeland season two also introduces the latest Vaught hero

39
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:20.270
Stormfront who turns out to be an actual century old Nazi.

40
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.213
<v 1>Kamala.</v>

41
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.100
<v 0>And so if it seems like the boys is full of people, espousing, disingenuous,</v>

42
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.020
politics, and posturing for the cameras.

43
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.740
It's because the show goes to great lengths to show us how almost every

44
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:37.070
character is constantly performing after all.

45
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:39.890
It's not enough to simply be a hero in this world.

46
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.360
You have to play a hero to superhero star in movies, title card,

47
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.600
Dawn of the seven. Go on talk, show circuits.

48
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.290
<v 1>The storefront, congrats on the seven. Are you most excited to be here as I am?</v>

49
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.360
No, I don't think so.

50
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.470
<v 0>Even give those lame midnight religious infomercials, but thanks to the church.</v>

51
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.930
<v 1>Of the collective. I know now the kind of man I want to be, Hey dude,</v>

52
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.753
that's not cool.

53
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.490
<v 0>Even when they're not on the screen, they worry about public approval ratings.</v>

54
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.820
<v 1>A 0.1 and a half, two.</v>

55
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.390
<v 0>And fastidiously, try to keep their personal selves in check.</v>

56
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.350
<v 1>Oh my God, everyone is still being stage managed life.</v>

57
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.820
Isn't actually PR.

58
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.560
<v 0>Strategy. You can say what you think.</v>

59
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.220
And it's not just our superheroes who are constantly putting on a show,

60
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.720
whether it's a Becca plane house with a sociopathic Superman or Congresswoman

61
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:33.630
Victoria Newman whipping her base into a frenzy.

62
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.470
Every character seems to put on a mask at one time or another.

63
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.390
So here's the question. Wisecrack.

64
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.470
What do you think happens when these deliberate performances collide with hot

65
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:47.970
button social issues? Well, we've got a term for you, virtue signaling. Now,

66
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.550
before you smashed that dislike button here,

67
00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:54.450
me out virtue signaling is a term that gets thrown around to suggest that people

68
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:58.560
are disingenuously, engaging with social issues, not out of genuine concern,

69
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:02.490
but to promote their own self image while it's certainly a real phenomenon.

70
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.570
It's basically become a catch all term to call anyone who cares about anything.

71
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.130
A fraud. One might say that even my discussion of virtue signaling is in itself.

72
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.090
Some kind of signal,

73
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:16.500
a virtue about how wise I am in an effort to make wisecracks seem Trey woke.

74
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.350
And then if you get mad at that and tweet about it,

75
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.910
your righteous indignation could itself be some virtue signaling to your

76
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.100
impassioned fans. Acquaintance,

77
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.390
it's very easy to call just about anything virtue signaling.

78
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.350
And it's also often, but not always a lazy and incoherent argument.

79
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.820
And it's confusing because we live in a world where we don't trust anyone to

80
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:43.380
stand for anything for the right reasons. And the boys takes this confusion.

81
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.200
Head-on the boys is centrally concerned,

82
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.620
not with how ordinary people display their supportive social issues,

83
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.990
but how corporations do in turn.

84
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:56.760
It explores how ordinary people end up consuming information about those ideas

85
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.430
in season one, for instance, VOD, rebrands,

86
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.160
their heroes Starlight as a feminist icon.

87
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.040
She transformed Grace's her feminine strength, goodbye yellow brick road.

88
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.680
Hello.

89
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.513
<v 1>Starlight.</v>

90
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.860
<v 0>Except well, their brand of female empowerment through sexuality.</v>

91
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.780
Isn't exactly what the budding superhero had in mind, but doesn't care.

92
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.380
They're more concerned with the image of an empowered woman that people can also

93
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.230
audible. Then, you know, actually empowering anyone.

94
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.090
<v 1>Most importantly, it tells a story of your transformation</v>

95
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.030
of what you're going through. How exactly do you know what I'm going through?

96
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.080
Exactly.

97
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.000
<v 0>AKA virtue signaling the Starlight rebranding helps their bottom line rather</v>

98
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:45.900
than any feminist cause a similar conflict happens in season two,

99
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.510
Homeland or maliciously outs, queen Mave.

100
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.600
<v 1>Who in the seven is gay queen Mave.</v>

101
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.501
<v 0>Revealing her.</v>

102
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:56.250
Ex-girlfriend who Mave is then forced to pretend is her current lover,

103
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.390
Vaught reimagines maze forced outing in their film,

104
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:03.530
Dawn of the seven as a wholesome coming out story complete with a cliched love

105
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:06.110
interest in the form of a counter-culture computer hacker.

106
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.360
<v 1>I'm afraid too to show the world who I am. Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.600
So who are you made HUD gay.

108
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.610
<v 0>After establishing Mave as a icon bought capitalizes on it to sell it like</v>

109
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.473
this.

110
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.800
<v 1>Right? Because you can't be prepped on an empty stomach.</v>

111
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.880
<v 0>It's worth noting that while Mave bars are sadly fictitious,</v>

112
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.890
this whole using someone's identity for profit is a fairly common advertising

113
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:33.520
strategy.

114
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.720
While your head of digital marketing may genuinely care about say racism,

115
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.560
their message is still getting filtered through the lens of what's going to make

116
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:43.060
us money. As a result.

117
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.770
Most companies only support social issues after they become massively popular

118
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:49.240
and therefore safe.

119
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.170
Like how shampoo conglomerate L'Oreal posted about standing with the black

120
00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:55.390
community this summer, despite Oh right.

121
00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.190
Apparently ending their partnership with a model in 2017 because she spoke out

122
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.450
against white supremacy and filtering social issues through the lens of profit.

123
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.130
Isn't just massively annoying.

124
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.850
It can actively harm people take may of sexuality.

125
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.820
<v 1>You know, maybe Mavis by, right? Yeah. You know what? I'm just feeling.</v>

126
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.100
Lesbian is a bit of an easier sell, but more cut and dry.

127
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.090
<v 0>Clearly vaults preoccupation with gay rights is just another sales tactic.</v>

128
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.990
Not in earnest means of celebrating Mave for who she actually is.

129
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.010
The company then tries to overhaul the image of May's pretend partner, Elena.

130
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.540
So she can better conform to the stereotype of what a lesbian should look like.

131
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.990
<v 1>That looks like men's wear few research shows that two feminine women in a</v>

132
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:36.850
relationship since a problematic man.

133
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.120
<v 0>This is the danger of virtue signaling as marketing strategy.</v>

134
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.080
It puts a corporate friendly face on social causes, thus obscuring.

135
00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:48.340
The actual reality people are then bombarded with images that reinforce the big

136
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.900
business version of reality.

137
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.340
And this sort of corporate do Gooding often provides a useful and deliberate

138
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.730
distraction from a given businesses, less savory practices.

139
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.170
This is well-documented and Fran Hawthorne's ethical chic in vaults case.

140
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.190
All the feminism and gay pride distracts people from the reality that the

141
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:10.600
company is a private military contractor with a less than stellar human rights

142
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:14.020
record. And this way we might better appreciate the boys.

143
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.790
Most glorious jab at Marvel for context and season two Vaute is going

144
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.680
all in on female empowerment with their new PR campaign girls. Get it done.

145
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.340
<v 1>Tell us a little about how girls get it done, girls, get it done, girls,</v>

146
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:29.140
get it done, girls. Get it done.

147
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.920
<v 0>Idea is that since there have never been three women in the seven before,</v>

148
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.920
now's the time to cash in, on not being sexist anymore,

149
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.080
but for all the congratulatory talk,

150
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.970
female empowerment is pretty much the exact opposite of what Vaute is actually

151
00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:46.180
about. For starters it's newest film the Dawn of the seven.

152
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.020
Isn't exactly concerned with portraying realistic female characters.

153
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.440
<v 1>All women is either unknowable, Hitchcock, or Michael Bay.</v>

154
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.640
I'm going to get that a lifetime drinking off the transformers.

155
00:08:56.641 --> 00:09:00.750
Didn't exactly make you popular ladies, but, um, well effort would be nice.

156
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.420
<v 0>Literal Nazi saying this,</v>

157
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.900
and it's not like the company has embraced a girl power off the screen.

158
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.170
Either recall are coerced into spandex. Starlight.

159
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.960
<v 1>Confine was mailed outfit. Why not?</v>

160
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.590
<v 0>All of which brings us to that Marvel scene to summarize.</v>

161
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.380
There is one very notable moment in a vendor's end game.

162
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.480
When Peter Parker asked captain Marvel,

163
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:24.770
how she plans to get past the incoming onslaught of Badman in response,

164
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.650
the Scarlet witch, and a coy pop in and say.

165
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.010
<v 1>She's got help.</v>

166
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.700
<v 0>As more female heroes swoop into help. When I saw it,</v>

167
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.800
tons of kids went eight because Marvel was finally letting their female heroes

168
00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:43.160
shine. But for more jaded adults, this all felt a little forced.

169
00:09:43.161 --> 00:09:46.520
Exactly the kind of corporate feminism that we'd become wary of.

170
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.560
And the boys seems to agree mimicking Marvel scene in the Dawn of the seven.

171
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.600
<v 1>Get through all of them. Don't worry, girls,</v>

172
00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:57.434
get it done.

173
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.350
<v 0>Much like Vaute celebrates their girls. Get it done.</v>

174
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:03.020
After years of being a total boys club.

175
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.490
Marvel scene is a weird victory lap for a company that waited a whole decade

176
00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:11.930
before putting out its first standalone female superhero film, captain Marvel,

177
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.200
which also happens to be a movie that many have called a thinly veiled

178
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:16.940
recruitment tool for the air force.

179
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.163
<v 1>And so.</v>

180
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.320
<v 0>And that's not by accident.</v>

181
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.820
The us military has often exerted editorial influence over movies like top gun

182
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.570
or captain Marvel in exchange for access to CIC tanks and planes,

183
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.310
the results a scrappy,

184
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:35.420
but not too rough around the edges hero who can be turned bolt into a toy line

185
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.700
and an advertisement for the U S military.

186
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.110
<v 1>Spirit of her.</v>

187
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.160
That sense of humor mixed with total capability and whatever challenge comes her

188
00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:45.280
way is really what air force pilots are.

189
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.430
<v 0>The kind of hero who would never ever do something like kick a person while</v>

190
00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:50.480
they're down and yell.

191
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.030
See in the brand safe virtue signaling realm of corporate social justice.

192
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.730
Everything has to play well with the large audience.

193
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.480
And so all the corporations who sponsor pride parades want to ignore that.

194
00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:07.340
The first pride was actually a riot incited by police brutality or how those who

195
00:11:07.341 --> 00:11:09.980
vaguely stand against hate on Instagram.

196
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.370
Never want to go into the details about what that actually means,

197
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.810
but the boys does.

198
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.820
It looks like this three women giving a bloody beat down to a literal Nazi.

199
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.850
Also congrats Marvel.

200
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.260
You've been roasted now a common problem with the way the word virtue signaling

201
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:31.910
gets thrown around is that the term seems exclusively used against the left.

202
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.080
So a sensible question would be is virtue signaling confined to the liberal

203
00:11:36.081 --> 00:11:39.230
sphere. And the answer to that is absolutely not.

204
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.190
We just don't usually think about it in those terms to see what I mean.

205
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.510
Let's look at the King of conservative virtue, signaling himself Homeland,

206
00:11:47.511 --> 00:11:50.660
or if virtue signaling is the invocation of issues or values out of

207
00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:53.060
self-interest rather than genuine concern,

208
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.290
then this is Homelanders patriotism to a T.

209
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.610
The dude does not give about America or American citizens,

210
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.780
but he goes to great lengths to seem like he has a raging hard-on for the troops

211
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.370
and the land of the free. Oh.

212
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.940
<v 1>And, uh, you guys,</v>

213
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.360
you are the real heroes.

214
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.140
<v 0>Not only that our sociopathic soup is a very careful to invoke all those cheesy</v>

215
00:12:19.141 --> 00:12:21.600
patriotic platitudes when addressing crowds.

216
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:31.530
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

217
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.530
<v 0>This rhetoric we might add is common to all politicians,</v>

218
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.540
but especially those on the right.

219
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.870
But if you have scissors or they're amazing soldiers like I have,

220
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.520
you would know that freedom comes at a price. Of course,

221
00:12:44.521 --> 00:12:48.720
this is the same guy who down to a whole airliner of American civilians before

222
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:52.740
casually flying off and letting them sing to their watery graves to see how

223
00:12:52.741 --> 00:12:55.530
shallow all this patriotic posturing really is.

224
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.800
You need only to look at what gets Homeland or upset,

225
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.810
not the deaths of innocent Americans,

226
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.860
but rather those rare moments when he isn't showered with love and adoration.

227
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.730
For example,

228
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.450
when people come after home Lander for accidentally killing an innocent

229
00:13:09.451 --> 00:13:13.080
bystander, we see the strongest man in America breakdown

230
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:21.660
Of course,

231
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.890
a home Lander isn't alone when it comes to virtue signaling via patriotism VODs

232
00:13:25.891 --> 00:13:28.530
is arguably just as bad on one hand,

233
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.100
the company turns out pro military ads like this one we're proud of.

234
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.760
<v 1>To fly alongside them. And now we could use your support that's right.</v>

235
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.740
Made with our new campaign saving.

236
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.110
<v 0>Sort of like that captain Marvel app, right on the other hand is Stormfront.</v>

237
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:45.780
So rightly points out. It's all a farce.

238
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.060
<v 1>Oh, FYI, not a real base.</v>

239
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.980
<v 0>See like Homeland or Yvonne.</v>

240
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.520
Isn't interested in actual national security or supporting the troops.

241
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.060
All they're interested in is those sweet, sweet military contracts.

242
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.130
<v 1>Only one company that has the product to fight back.</v>

243
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.950
<v 0>And to that end, avant does everything from blackmail,</v>

244
00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:09.060
sitting senators to imprisoning and experimenting on innocent civilians with

245
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:11.970
compound V real good job, keeping America safe.

246
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.090
There's also a kind of Christian virtue signaling, you know,

247
00:14:15.091 --> 00:14:17.910
pastors who get rich and famous for signaling to the world,

248
00:14:17.911 --> 00:14:20.610
how much they love Jesus. Even if they're sleazebags.

249
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.920
<v 1>She's all that gray, the gateway he's the Lincoln, the man.</v>

250
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.210
<v 0>Like that. And finally, there's what I call authenticity signaling,</v>

251
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.920
which is all about broadcasting,

252
00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:35.580
how real you are as best embodied by Stormfront. Be a.

253
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.830
<v 1>If you want, be whatever, just drop the mask once in a while. It feels good.</v>

254
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.010
<v 0>Of course, her persona is also carefully crafted,</v>

255
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.220
meant to rile up her base for her own gross ends.

256
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.120
But because she defines herself in opposition to her squeaky, clean heroes,

257
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.650
her own performance of realness finds a receptive audience.

258
00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.590
<v 1>Outlander and nave. We're going to eat MRAs, a ditch with the rest of the group.</v>

259
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.150
<v 0>With all this virtue signaling coming from both the left and right from</v>

260
00:15:04.151 --> 00:15:08.350
individuals to corporations, you might be asking yourself one simple question.

261
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.460
How did we get here? Virtue signaling. Even if it wasn't called,

262
00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:16.060
that is quite old. They even complain about it in the Bible.

263
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.710
When Jesus said you needed to shut up on Facebook about buying a stranger

264
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:24.850
Starbucks. Well, I'm paraphrasing, but that's basically what he's saying.

265
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:29.290
But our current virtue signaling hellscape may be at least partially the result

266
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:30.250
of one industry,

267
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.300
public relations or PR ever since Ivy Lee,

268
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.680
the founder of modern PR first repaired the Rockefeller family's Robert Barron

269
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.820
image through heavily slanted press releases and a highly choreographed sympathy

270
00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:43.900
tour through Colorado.

271
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.340
The world wised up to the fact that a little positive publicity goes a long way.

272
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:49.120
Of course,

273
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.950
people maligned Lee as a hired slanderer and poisoner of public

274
00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:58.000
opinion. And maybe they had a point because here's the messed up thing.

275
00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.830
Wisecrack, a hundred years ago,

276
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.940
Lee opened up the flood Gates and now the field of positive spin can be used to

277
00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:07.480
rehabilitate the image of just about any one or anything.

278
00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:11.050
And that's where things get dark to see what I mean.

279
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.460
Let's look at the messed up journey of the guy you love to hate the deep AKA

280
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.031
Aquaman,

281
00:16:16.031 --> 00:16:20.170
except he does sexual assault after being booted from the seven for sexually

282
00:16:20.171 --> 00:16:22.810
assaulting Starlight, the deep spirals heart,

283
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.350
eventually getting some time in the clinker for commandeering a kid's water

284
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.450
park.

285
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.180
<v 1>It's supposed to be fun in the Mariana trench.</v>

286
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.970
<v 0>When he's bailed out, though,</v>

287
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:38.020
it's by the church of the collective who in exchange for his bank account,

288
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:43.000
agree to do some serious PR work to get him back into the seven. To that end,

289
00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:47.500
the church makes the deep appear in some seriously cheesy infomercials and even

290
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.120
focused has a wife for him.

291
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.040
<v 1>I thought I got to choose you do. And you're choosing Cassandra.</v>

292
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.540
<v 0>Now the running joke of the season is how truly pathetic the deepest and how</v>

293
00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:02.650
willing he is to go along with a PR blitz that presents such a patently false

294
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.720
image. But underneath the humor,

295
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.370
we have to realize how fundamentally screwed up all this is through the

296
00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:14.140
persuasive dark arts of PR, the deep, a repeat sexual offender,

297
00:17:14.141 --> 00:17:18.850
and nearly regains his position in the most prestigious paramilitary

298
00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:20.770
organization in the world.

299
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.090
<v 1>Coach Malala, you subsized tweet called you a sweetheart. She's a sweetheart.</v>

300
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.320
<v 0>But if you think it's terrifying that PR can rehabilitate a piece of like the</v>

301
00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:31.900
deep, then you're going to love this next one.

302
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.980
The boys shows how PR and all its virtue signaling can even make.

303
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.980
Nazi-ism look kosher to understand what I mean.

304
00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:43.660
Let's look at home Lander and his new boo Stormfront by understanding the

305
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.980
ins and outs of PR Stormfront is able to revitalize Homelanders flagging all

306
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:50.490
American brand. You don't need 50 million.

307
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.550
<v 1>People to love you. You need 5 million people.</v>

308
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.130
You have fans. I have soldiers.

309
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.070
<v 0>Their word Stormfront and true.</v>

310
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.000
Don Draper fashion knows how to sell a message to the masses,

311
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.290
basically Homeland or takes all that patriotic virtue signaling he's known for.

312
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.290
And appends it to a violently xenophobic message.

313
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.960
And the results are downright terrifying.

314
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.230
<v 3>Nation. Under God, remember</v>

315
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.370
godless in human supervillains started whoring across our borders and

316
00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:27.410
dragging us down into their money.

317
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.720
<v 0>It goes without saying that neither Homeland or nor Stormfront cares about this</v>

318
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.460
supposed super terrorist threat,

319
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.110
a threat we might add that was literally created by Homeland or himself has ever

320
00:18:39.111 --> 00:18:39.800
occurred.

321
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.610
<v 4>Knew that a soup terrorist showing up</v>

322
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.350
exactly when we needed him to was pretty

323
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.270
incredible coincidence.

324
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.320
<v 0>Instead, all the spin serves the purpose of a larger darker message.</v>

325
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.600
A race war led by Ava Bronto.

326
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.400
<v 1>They want to wipe us from this earth just because of the color of our skin.</v>

327
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.980
Really it's called white genocide.

328
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.390
<v 0>Stormfront intuitively understands that if she wants to sell her vision of white</v>

329
00:19:08.391 --> 00:19:12.650
is right. She needs to dress it up with all that classic American Apple pie,

330
00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.140
virtue signaling, or in her own words.

331
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.950
<v 1>People love what I have to say. They believe in it.</v>

332
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.310
They just don't like the word Nazi.

333
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.700
<v 0>It's also interesting to consider that storm fronts own brand of realness is</v>

334
00:19:25.701 --> 00:19:29.720
just another cynical way to brand herself while VOD might traditionally favor

335
00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:32.840
the more buttoned up approach of giving speeches with talking points.

336
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.540
She prefers crafting any more unpolished brand,

337
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:40.070
but a brand nonetheless paying people to make means in packaging people's

338
00:19:40.071 --> 00:19:40.904
bigotry, right?

339
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.050
<v 1>This is just the first batch I'll have Logan punch up the fear, Logan,</v>

340
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.850
my main queen.

341
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.930
<v 0>Now the trouble,</v>

342
00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:51.830
the virtue signaling is that many sociologists and philosophers have said that

343
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:54.650
basically everything we do is a performance.

344
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.730
Whether you're going to church pursuing a career or getting a sweet new set of

345
00:19:58.731 --> 00:19:59.564
truck, nuts,

346
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.320
everything we do is filtered through how we think others will perceive our

347
00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:04.154
actions.

348
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.350
<v 1>As long as you're a trending, right?</v>

349
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.290
<v 0>If Starlight wants to do good and be recognized for it,</v>

350
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.870
it doesn't necessarily make her good deeds worthless.

351
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.400
The problem the boys wants to remind us is when people weaponize good acts to

352
00:20:16.401 --> 00:20:20.810
distract from their evil acts and with the world full of marketers and PR reps,

353
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.760
it's often hard to tell the difference.

354
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:28.040
<v 4>So it's just business than I, when Mr. Butcher in history,</v>

355
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.200
has it ever been about anything different.

356
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.840
<v 0>But what do you think wisecrack is the boys' rights?</v>

357
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.930
Can we even begin to decipher what's real anymore?

358
00:20:35.931 --> 00:20:40.190
And does it even matter smash that subscribe button like Homeland or is okay,

359
00:20:40.191 --> 00:20:42.680
we can't show that. Don't forget to ring that bell,

360
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.530
huge things to all our patrons for your support and as always,

361
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.120
thanks for watching later,

362
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.120
[inaudible].
