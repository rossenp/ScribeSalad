1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.293
<v 0>Hm.</v>

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.090
<v 1>What's up guys, Michael here to use my philosophy degree to examine a,</v>

3
00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:12.500
another piece of the pop culture Canon this time, we're going back to college,

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.280
a place known for intellectual exploration, social development,

5
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:19.370
and signed atheism pledge is due on the first day of class.

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.500
If that last one didn't bring back any memories,

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.990
then you didn't attend a Hadley university,

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.680
a fictional college where philosophy is taught by a washed up Hercules who was

9
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.870
like really, really mad at God. Like.

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.290
<v 0>Yes, I hate.</v>

11
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.050
<v 1>God. This is the setting of God's not dead.</v>

12
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.810
The first installment in a trilogy produced by the company,

13
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:41.450
pure flicks like Netflix, but pure.

14
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.680
It presents a vision of America in which angry philosophers are on a mission to

15
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:50.540
destroy Christianity as both a former non angry philosophy professor and guy who

16
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:51.590
went to Christian summer camp.

17
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.430
Once you might understand why this film is of particular interest to me.

18
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.170
So let's see how this film portrays the brave and potentially nefarious souls

19
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.810
who have gone into life destroying debt to teach philosophy.

20
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.160
And this philosophy reacts to God's not dead before we get into the

21
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:10.790
philosophical nuance of a film that lets you know what character is a radical

22
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:14.270
atheist by the I love evolution sticker on the back of her car.

23
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.230
I wanted to take a second to tell you about wisecracks podcast because you're

24
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:20.780
here right now, looking deeply into my eyes.

25
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.690
I can safely assume you're already a fan of our video content,

26
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.770
but what you might not know is that we also make pretty good audio content and

27
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.370
my totally unbiased opinion. If you love movies, which I mean, why wouldn't you,

28
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.550
you should check out. Show me the meaning where our hosts, Austin,

29
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:37.760
Raymond and Ryan explore all the philosophical nuance floating beneath the

30
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:39.890
surface of both current and classic films.

31
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.490
And if you're potentially too obsessed with everything going on in pop culture,

32
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.970
you should check out culture binge the podcast where we explore the weird,

33
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:49.790
wonderful and worrisome sides of the cultural zeitgeist.

34
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.840
It's hosted by someone you already know in love more of a brother than a friend,

35
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.190
along with wisecracks, head of content, Alec and wisecrack researcher survey.

36
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.030
So click the links in the description or find them on your favorite podcast app.

37
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.860
Now back to the show and now for a quick recap, Josh Weeden,

38
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.330
no relation to Josh.

39
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.200
Sweden is a freshmen student who shows up to his philosophy one 50 class.

40
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.600
Whereas professor explains that before they begin,

41
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.600
everyone must sign a paper that says, God is dead.

42
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.840
Josh can't do this because he's a Christian. I can't do what you want.

43
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:21.530
I'm a Christian.

44
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.980
So the professor insists that unless he wants to lose 30% of his grade,

45
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.100
he must convince the entire class that God's not dead.

46
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.630
<v 0>You'll get three sessions.</v>

47
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:34.610
The last 20 minutes of each of the next three classes to make

48
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:35.450
your case.

49
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.190
<v 1>Please do a series of awkwardly,</v>

50
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.410
incense showdowns between Josh and his professor,

51
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.190
which ends with Josh rocking out at a concert and the professor. Well,

52
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.280
I'm not rocking out at all, but more on that later.

53
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.630
And while I would love to also explore the films and numerous absurd and often

54
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:51.650
dark plot lines,

55
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.730
including a breathtaking performance from Willie Robertson of duck dynasty fame.

56
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.760
<v 0>So y'all had made a fortune. Isn't that right? We're doing all right.</v>

57
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.300
<v 2>And certainly by a bigger tires on our trucks and four wheelers to get out in</v>

58
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:05.860
the mud with. So life is good.

59
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.490
<v 1>We're going to stick to the philosophy stuff. Okay?</v>

60
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.320
Check out the first day of class.

61
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.820
<v 0>Michelle for cool. They're trying to wrestle Ludwig, Feuerbach,</v>

62
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.080
patrolled Brecht. What do they all have

63
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.620
in common? They're all dead.

64
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.020
That would be incorrect. Mr. Dawkins,

65
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.580
Mr. Chomsky is still very much alive. Mr. G dog to rock trigger.

66
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.570
He said his name was G dog G dog. Well,

67
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:39.720
they are or were

68
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.320
atheists. Okay.

69
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.460
<v 1>Um, the G dog thing has me shook with some of these names.</v>

70
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.200
Fuko Nicha,

71
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.430
humil Russell might very well be on an intro to philosophy syllabus,

72
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:54.810
but others he has on here.

73
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.730
Dawkins Chomsky Brecht would be very unlikely inclusions as there. Um,

74
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.530
not philosophers also. There's no way that that's his handwriting at all,

75
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.330
but nitpicky basic fact-checking aside. There's a way bigger problem.

76
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.430
Defining these philosophers as fundamentally atheist, for example,

77
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.210
um, David Hume's philosophy, isn't categorically atheist.

78
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.020
He simply thinks that human knowledge has a pretty limited scope and that even

79
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:25.830
if a thing like God exists, we don't have the intellectual ability to prove it.

80
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.110
This is if you shared by many non atheist,

81
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:29.670
including some priest and theologians,

82
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:32.040
I've had beers with over the years and Feuerbach,

83
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.950
wasn't so much about militant atheism.

84
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.280
He just thought that theology is actually about anthropology.

85
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.910
Which just means that sometimes when we talk about how amazing God is,

86
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.170
we're just reflecting on some of the best aspects of our own humanity. Okay,

87
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:47.100
let's see what he said.

88
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.360
<v 0>Next this semester,</v>

89
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:53.130
I propose that we refuse to waste our limited time

90
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:57.420
together, debating the existence of the big man in the sky, the myth.

91
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.730
<v 1>This would never, ever happen.</v>

92
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.410
You just can't have a historical introduction to philosophy that skips over the

93
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:05.820
discussion of God. Now,

94
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.450
I don't know what's on every philosophy syllabus in the world,

95
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.700
but your typical intro to philosophy course,

96
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:13.920
it definitely has some medieval philosophy,

97
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:17.790
which is almost exclusively Christian and Muslim people like Thomas Aquinas, St.

98
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.620
Gustin or at the center.

99
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.490
And even in an intro to philosophy course had some anti-God biases.

100
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.360
It would still be weird to skip past philosophical heavyweights like George

101
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:31.920
Hagle or Soren Kierkegaard, along with hipper thinkers like Emmanuel Levinas,

102
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:34.830
Jacques Derrida, and even sloppy Slovenian Santa Claus.

103
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.000
Slavo jijak all of whom have seriously engaged with religion and theology in

104
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.843
their work.

105
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.100
All of which is to say this imaginary philosophy class would be seriously

106
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:47.100
incomplete. Okay. Let's see what this hero does now.

107
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.820
<v 0>God is dead. Oh, is he?</v>

108
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.810
This is of course a metaphor, but an illustrated one.

109
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.920
Meaning not that God somehow died,

110
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.640
but rather that he never existed in the first place.

111
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.590
All that it required from each of you is that you fill in the papers.

112
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:09.230
I've just given you a three little words.

113
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.810
God is dead.

114
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.390
<v 1>God, I would, I would pay money to see this guys rate my professor page.</v>

115
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.260
Although I think he would get a chili pepper because skill looking guy, okay,

116
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.920
this is, this is just, this is ridiculous. Um,

117
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.730
it would never happen ever under any circumstance. Also,

118
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.950
if I'd ever tried to pull something like this,

119
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.450
my brilliant and not idiot students would have told me off categorical

120
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:38.770
statements like this are antithetical to the entire spirit of philosophy,

121
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.830
which should include space for wonder curiosity,

122
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.360
and be careful examination of a wide range of positions.

123
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.020
Okay. Time to meet our friend, Josh.

124
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.600
<v 0>Mr. Weakness, something wrong. Yeah, I can't,</v>

125
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.730
I can't do what you want. I'm a Christian. Allow me to explain the alternative.

126
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.130
If you cannot bring yourself to admit that God is dead for the purposes of this

127
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:10.570
class and you will need to defend the antithesis, that God is not dead.

128
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.070
<v 1>But this is all types of absurd.</v>

129
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.140
And for a little inside baseball in most academic departments, syllabus,

130
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.500
and course structures are things that are shared with and peer reviewed by your

131
00:07:20.501 --> 00:07:24.130
colleagues. So if I was teaching a course and put publicly declaring,

132
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:28.450
God is dead equals 30% of overall grade. My colleagues would say, abs,

133
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.650
absolutely not.

134
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.240
And there might be a further meeting to evaluate my overall soundness of mind.

135
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.710
This is also God awful teaching the goal of academic philosophy.

136
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:42.460
Isn't to instill hardcore ideological concepts into the brains of impressionable

137
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:43.210
young people.

138
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.510
That's what the entire media and advertising industries before rather it's to

139
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:50.170
help people learn how to think more critically about themselves in the world,

140
00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:53.050
around them, but professor protein in his toothpaste,

141
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.050
isn't encouraging Josh to get more curious about his beliefs.

142
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.710
He's basically forcing him to take on an equally inflexible position.

143
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.633
Once again,

144
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.270
not the vibes of philosophy you've likely heard of the Socratic method,

145
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.360
which describes how the OGE of the game Socrates pot,

146
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.660
which was basically by walking around and asking questions.

147
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.980
The point wasn't to implant information, but to inspire thoughts.

148
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.110
Okay. Let's move on and see how our guy Josh does at his first guest lecture.

149
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.570
Wait, I want to see one more thing real quick.

150
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.230
<v 0>For our next class. Please have read David Humes,</v>

151
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:30.460
the problems of induction when they day carts discourse on method,

152
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.850
which you may add Bertrand. Russell's why I am not a Christian.

153
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.890
<v 1>Oh, okay. Okay. Um, wait, I need to talk about these assignments.</v>

154
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.730
He didn't even hand out a syllabus or do any actual teaching,

155
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.720
but now he's assigning to difficult texts from modern philosophy.

156
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.890
And one of these by Descartes includes an entire section where he offers three

157
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.850
separate proofs for the existence of God. Well done,

158
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:59.970
professor too cool for church. Okay. Now we can move on.

159
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:00.621
<v 3>Most.</v>

160
00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:05.420
Cosmologists now agree that the universe began some 13.7 billion years

161
00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:07.220
ago in an event known as the big bang,

162
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.870
the entire universe jumping into existence and a trillionth of a trillionth of a

163
00:09:11.871 --> 00:09:16.760
second out of nothingness and an unimaginably intense flash of light

164
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.600
is how he would expect the universe to respond.

165
00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:24.350
If God were to actually utter the command in Genesis one, three,

166
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.450
let there be light.

167
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.430
<v 1>Okay. Uh, this isn't it Josh. It just, it just isn't.</v>

168
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.320
So here are fledgling philosophers pushing a God of the gaps argument

169
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.540
in which God is being used as filler for explanatory gaps in philosophical or

170
00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:42.470
scientific knowledge.

171
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.550
So we can't understand what was happening before the big bang. No problem.

172
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.480
God did it. It was struggling to understand the foundations of mathematics.

173
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.010
God obviously unsure of why you find yourself sweating profusely while wearing a

174
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:59.480
t-shirt on a 65 degree day with low humidity guys.

175
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:02.150
I think God did this to me. Now, if I were Josh,

176
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.960
I would have maybe brought up ontological argument for the existence of God,

177
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.100
which coincidentally was in one of the first readings developed by Anselm and

178
00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:11.390
popularized by Descartes,

179
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.370
which super briefly argues that there must be a beam than which no greater can

180
00:10:16.371 --> 00:10:17.204
be conceived.

181
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.590
This is at least a philosophical argument and not an argument for God's ability

182
00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:25.460
to snap his fingers in a stenosis like fashion to make stuff exist.

183
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.403
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

184
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.150
<v 1>But all that said Josh,</v>

185
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.140
his argument that God is the only good explanation for the emergence of matter

186
00:10:36.141 --> 00:10:40.310
in the universe is kind of like saying God is the only explanation for why honey

187
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:42.950
and hot sauce compliment each other so well. Okay.

188
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:44.600
Let's see what happens after class.

189
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.870
<v 4>You think you're smarter than me Wheaton.</v>

190
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.020
Do you think there's any argument you can make that I won't have an answer for?

191
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.270
I never said I was smarter.

192
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.180
That's the first intelligent thing you've said in that classroom.

193
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.590
There is a God and yet I'm him, but know this.

194
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.370
If you truly feel a need to continue with this charade,

195
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.230
I will make it my personal mission to destroy any hope of a lot of grit in your

196
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:10.064
view.

197
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:15.110
<v 1>Ah, okay. It's the safety obvious a professor at an academic institution.</v>

198
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.740
It would never be able to chase a student down the hallway to physically and

199
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:20.960
verbally assault him without being fired.

200
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.760
Pretty much immediately guys like the OJ Simpson, philosophical educators. Well,

201
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.910
plenty of certifiably, bad things happen from here. Sadly.

202
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.920
None of it really has much to do with philosophy.

203
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:33.920
So let's skip ahead to Josh's next lecture.

204
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.993
<v 3>It's like this.</v>

205
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.380
If I say to you that I can prove that spam is the best tasting food that's ever

206
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:42.830
existed because you get all of history, no food has ever tasted better.

207
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:44.720
You'd probably look at me strange and say,

208
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:46.490
I haven't proven anything and you'd be right.

209
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.180
But when hockey claims that the universe created itself because it needed to

210
00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:54.910
create itself and then offers that as an explanation as to how and why it was

211
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:58.270
created, we don't immediately recognize that he's doing the same thing,

212
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.063
but he is.

213
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.860
<v 1>Oh, okay. Um, what a logic bro, energy right here.</v>

214
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.750
But keep in mind that Hawking is professor goddess, essence favorite thinker.

215
00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:13.500
And here Josh is trying to slightly use Hawkins theories against him.

216
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.030
Basically my man's pulling a weird appeal to authority card in lieu of making an

217
00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:21.000
actual argument. But again, the problem is that Hawking is,

218
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.560
as previously mentioned a scientist and not a philosopher making philosophical

219
00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:28.260
arguments. Kayla let's watch our guy try to frigging home here.

220
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.830
<v 3>But, but if you can't bear to disagree with Hawking's thinking,</v>

221
00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:35.400
then I suggest that you turn to page five of his book where he insists

222
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.920
philosophy is dead.

223
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.440
And if you're so sure professor Hawking's infallibility and philosophy really is

224
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.090
dead, then, uh,

225
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.570
there's really no need for this class.

226
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.750
<v 1>Whew, it's coming in a little hot there.</v>

227
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.020
So with all due respect to Josh who at this point has been dumped by his

228
00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:56.160
girlfriend of six years,

229
00:12:56.161 --> 00:12:58.890
simply because he decided to defend God in philosophy class,

230
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.610
a real thing that happens in the film. Uh, this has nothing to do with anything.

231
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.870
His argument is that in the last lecture professor big balls said that Hawkin

232
00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:09.180
was smart and also said that God isn't real.

233
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.820
And since smart people aren't wrong, God isn't real.

234
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.930
But now the smart man is same philosophy is dead. And if he's really that smart,

235
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.180
wouldn't he be right again? Um,

236
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.110
I just blame Stephen Hawking in his irrational hatred of philosophy for this

237
00:13:22.111 --> 00:13:22.711
one. They hatred,

238
00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:27.540
which makes no sense because philosophy created the very foundations of modern

239
00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:28.800
science. Okay. Uh,

240
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.300
Josh has one chance left to once and for all prove the existence of God and make

241
00:13:33.301 --> 00:13:37.290
atheism in untenable belief for the rest of time. Let's see if he can do it.

242
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.190
And before we get into Josh's third lecture, some crucial context, professor,

243
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:41.641
big Mac,

244
00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:46.260
no pickles stuck around after class to mock Josh and ended up revealing that he

245
00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:49.590
used to be a Christian until he lost his mom as a 12 year old,

246
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:54.300
this will come up again. It's only natural to beg God for her life. Okay.

247
00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:57.180
It's Josh's final chance. Let's see if he does it.

248
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.390
<v 3>It's that story famously pointed out.</v>

249
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.870
If God does not exist,

250
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.530
everything is permissible.

251
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.770
Professor Radison is right then all of this,

252
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.140
whatever we decide here is meaningless.

253
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.650
I mean our lives and ultimately our deaths are no more consequences.

254
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:17.550
That of a goldfish.

255
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.050
<v 1>This is ridiculous. Why does he hate goldfish? Like if you have one,</v>

256
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.230
maybe your parents want you to get a dog and you get a goldfish and you name it

257
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:28.110
freckles. And it's your friend. And Josh was just out here, like flushed them.

258
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.870
But last time Josh made a mistake by tying his argument to a random quote from a

259
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:37.980
physicist. This time he uses a quote from Russian novelist, uh,

260
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.270
Theodore Dostoevsky, except it really isn't a quote from Dostoyevsky,

261
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.970
but a line of dialogue from his novel, the brothers Karamazov.

262
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.620
It's an interesting line from an interesting novel and lots of philosophers have

263
00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:50.910
interacted with it over the years,

264
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.490
but it's less of a forceful argument than a starting point for an interesting

265
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:56.090
discussion.

266
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.780
But Josh uses this quote in the context of a larger argument about how without

267
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.360
the existence of God, we have no reason to be moral.

268
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.580
And a lot can be said about this because most ethical moral philosophies don't

269
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:09.770
have the existence of God as their first principle.

270
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.890
One of my personal favorite arguments for a system of humanist, ethics,

271
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.300
not grounded in theological principles is articulated by noted amphetamine

272
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.500
enthusiast. John Paul Sartre and existentialism is a humanism. And it,

273
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.430
he argues that if there is no God to give us moral principles,

274
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.110
we have to take on that responsibility for ourselves and engage in an ongoing

275
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:33.650
process of figuring out how to live a good life. You should read it.

276
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:38.510
It's easy to find as Jay Z once said type it in. Google is your friend, bruh,

277
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.620
even though Josh is a much more sympathetic character than professor steroids

278
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:47.030
smoothie, and I'm weirdly rooting for him. He's not really saying anything here.

279
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.580
So let's, let's see his final argument.

280
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.510
<v 4>Yeah. Who you really looking to fail professor</v>

281
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.890
or God God's GPA is.

282
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:05.230
It's a very simple question, professor. Why did you hate God?

283
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.700
Because he took everything away from me. Yes.

284
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.720
I hate God. How can you hate someone?

285
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.753
They don't exist.

286
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.810
<v 1>So that's a lot. They really build some tension there. Um,</v>

287
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.390
but now we're diving into the realm of the theological effects

288
00:16:25.391 --> 00:16:27.610
of psychological trauma on a teenager,

289
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.360
both professor big penis and Josh are bad at philosophy,

290
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.330
but at least Josh has an excuse,

291
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.900
which is that rather than teaching them philosophy, his professor has been busy,

292
00:16:37.901 --> 00:16:42.820
physically threatening him still rather than providing any convincing argument.

293
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.530
Josh finishes professor and pushups by pointing out that his intellectual

294
00:16:47.531 --> 00:16:50.170
framework is simply a reaction to his mother's death.

295
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.240
While we have sympathy for Josh here,

296
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.150
bullying your opponent about a traumatic loss.

297
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.780
Isn't the way to win philosophical debate. But Hey,

298
00:16:58.781 --> 00:16:59.920
when I was a college freshmen,

299
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.160
I didn't even know you were supposed to wash your sheets more than once a year.

300
00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:07.060
So who am I to judge? Okay. But if I were to judge,

301
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.470
clearly the filmmakers have no idea what philosophy actually is or what it does

302
00:17:11.471 --> 00:17:13.270
or what a philosophy class is actually like,

303
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.530
nor do they appear to have been anywhere in the vicinity of an open book of

304
00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:19.060
philosophy. Instead,

305
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.990
they just cooked up an entire film based on a misreading of a line from German

306
00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:27.880
philosopher, Friedrich, Nietzsche, the line, God is dead and we have killed him.

307
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.050
This was a way for nature to criticize European culture and philosophy,

308
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.920
not some simplistic reporting of the homicide of a daddy.

309
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.150
He was pointing out how the rationalism of enlightenment philosophy had

310
00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:44.050
explained a way the need for God. But since folks didn't notice this,

311
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.310
they were incapable of thinking about what meaning and morality without God even

312
00:17:48.311 --> 00:17:52.530
looks like of knowing this would have required the filmmakers to read three to

313
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:57.360
four full sentences. And I'm sure they were real busy doing God's stuff. Well,

314
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.480
there you have it. A two hour film about a philosophy class.

315
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.620
That's almost completely devoid of actual philosophy. It's a low bar,

316
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.830
but you can probably learn more about Nisha by watching Gilmore.

317
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.550
<v 4>Girls. This girl could name the state capitals at three,</v>

318
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.310
recite the periodic table at four,

319
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.820
discuss Schopenhauer his influence on nature when she was 10.

320
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.060
<v 1>Oh, and just so we don't leave you hanging at the end of the film.</v>

321
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.210
Professor cold cuts gets hit by a car flies through the air,

322
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.380
hits the deck like a ton of bricks and dies as he's converted to Christianity by

323
00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:28.850
two ministers on their way to Disney.

324
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.240
<v 4>Are you willing to put your faith in Jesus Christ?</v>

325
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.010
Are you willing to take that chance?

326
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.240
<v 1>And then while he's lying in the street dead,</v>

327
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.350
the dude from duck dynasty makes fun of him on a jumbotron at a Christian rock

328
00:18:45.351 --> 00:18:48.350
concert, and then the crowd boos him. One of your professors.

<v 4>Insisted that God is dead.</v>

330
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.520
<v 1>All while he's lifeless on the street,</v>

a block away with two Grinny ministers standing over him in philosophical terms.

332

This is what we call what the, so what do you guys think?

333
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.320
Should I be forced to watch the two sequels to try and uncover the brilliant

334
00:19:06.321 --> 00:19:08.450
philosophical core at the heart of this trilogy?

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.270
Or should I have taken Christopher's advice and Gilmore girls and joined the

336
00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:12.530

Like you're a distracted driver trying to end the life of a washed up

342
00:19:28.671 --> 00:19:30.530
philosopher and ring that bell.

343
00:19:30.531 --> 00:19:33.110
