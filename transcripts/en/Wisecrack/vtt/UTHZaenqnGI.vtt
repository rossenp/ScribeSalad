<v 0>This video is brought to you by Epic games.</v>

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.960
What's up wisecrack Michael here in 1987 in 1995,

3
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.010
two movies about futuristic crime fighters were box office hits. Well,

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.550
one was a hit and the other was a huge flop. Oh, okay. Okay.

5
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:22.580
Let me try it again. In 1987 and 1995,

6
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:26.060
two movies about futuristic crime fighters sold tickets across North America,

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.940
Robocop and judge dread at first,

8
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.540
these films might seem like just two more additions to the dumb action foot

9
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.700
cannon about the forces of good racking up that guy,

10
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.830
body counts in the name of justice boat.

11
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:41.480
What if they're actually doing a lot more like asking some really big questions,

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.470
questions like how should a society enforce its laws at the loader?

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.970
And more importantly,

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.630
what if they're secretly commenting and how these guys answered that question?

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.290
Let's find out in this wisecrack condition on a Robocop and judge Dredd,

16
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.333
who is the.

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.600
<v 1>And of course spoilers ahead.</v>

18
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.180
<v 0>But before we continue, I want to give a shout out to this week.</v>

19
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:04.520
Sponsor fortnight to catch you up to speed.

20
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.500
Fortnite is an Epic battle Royale game.

21
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.830
You drop out of a flying battle bus with a hundred players and fight to become

22
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:14.390
the last man standing the game season for chapter two, nexus war just dropped.

There'll be like your own private version of the next Marvel installment and

30

good news guys. Iron man is still alive too soon.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.120
So check it out now,

36
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.020
back to the show before filmmaker Paul Verhoeven and screenwriter,

37
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.000
Edward Neumeier brought us this.

38
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.970
Here's a bunch of MIT kids that looked like they could eat bugs for lunch.

39
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.280
They brought us Robocop in a futuristic dystopian, Detroit,

40
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:12.830
the mega corporation, Omni consumer products,

41
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.570
OCP wins a contract to run the city's police department after cutting funding so

42
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.490
that the cops can't do their jobs properly.

43
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.750
They leave police officer Alex Murphy to a gang of criminals led by the dad from

44
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:28.100
that 70 show Murphy is murder and OCP looking for a Guinea pig,

45
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.070
rebuilds them as a cost saving cyborg that is programmed to.

46
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.980
<v 1>Serve the public trust protects the innocent.</v>

47
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.410
<v 0>Eight years later, judge Dredd premiered sliced alones. Judge Joseph dread.</v>

48
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.570
Isn't a robot, but a heavily armored street.

49
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:46.550
Judge who patrols mega city one in this 2080 totalitarian police state law is

50
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:49.400
maintained by street judges who serve as judge, jury,

51
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.720
and executioner dread basically worships the law and is very good at

52
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:58.340
implementing it with catchphrases like a new you'd say until he gets

53
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:01.300
framed for murder. You're under arrest.

54
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.400
What's the charge murder Robocop.

55
00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:09.240
And judge Dredd have a lot of similarities and it's not just the coed locker

56
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.220
rooms. They're both stories about crime,

57
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:15.330
run a muck and the increasingly desperate and ethically questionable means of

58
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:16.680
containing it. Importantly,

59
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:20.760
both the worlds of Robocop and judge Dredd see law enforcement, outgunned,

60
00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:23.760
and ill-equipped to maintain order. Alex Murphy for instance,

61
00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:27.060
gets gunned down in part because backup is unavailable now,

62
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.870
whereas that backup backup is still on available. And even judge dreads,

63
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.750
please state still can't seem to keep up with the riff Raff.

64
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.890
Some cultural context is important in the 1960s and 1970s.

65
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:42.780
The violent crime rate in America increased by 126% 1980s

66
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:46.500
brought the crack cocaine epidemic and handgun related homicides doubled between

67
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:51.300
1985 and 1990 crime was heavily reported on and sensationalized by the

68
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:55.200
media and became a frequent talking point of political campaigns while most

69
00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.800
millennials and zoomers have lived their entire lives in a world with decreasing

70
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.820
crime rates. The same cannot be said for the original audiences of these films.

71
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.610
The idea that street savages had made the laws.

72
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:09.780
We know it collapsed as the judge Dredd intro tells us was a familiar idea to

73
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:13.650
anyone watching the five o'clock news. And for those terrified by crime,

74
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:14.970
something like this,

75
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.450
we're projecting the end of crime in old Detroit within 40 days,

76
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.120
was this stuff a fantasies at first glance,

77
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:25.830
one might assume these films were all aboard the pants over a crime epidemic

78
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:30.120
train, but both of these films are subversive commentaries on these fears,

79
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.880
not simple reflections of them for judge dread.

80
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.670
The logical conclusion of being tough on crime is this

81
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.060
whereas Robocop warns us about the dangers of fear-mongering and a for-profit

82
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:46.230
criminal justice system. I say good business is where you find it.

83
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.711
As you know,

84
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:53.280
we've entered into a contract with the city to run local law enforcement,

85
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.070
but the,

86
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.750
or these films commentary has less to do with this topic predictions about

87
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:02.010
policing and everything to do with this guy, Earl Warren,

88
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.200
chief justice of the U S Supreme court from 1953 to 1969 Warren headed the

89
00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:08.070
court through ruling.

90
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:11.610
So world changing that it's hard to imagine a time before them. Of course,

91
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:13.950
there's the big hits like Brown vs board of ed,

92
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:16.260
which desegregate schools and loving versus Virginia,

93
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.770
which legalized interracial marriage. But there's also the Miranda warning.

94
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.830
You have the right to remain silent, which was not a thing.

95
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.290
Some sweaty wig wearing founding father came up with,

96
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.030
but rather the result of a 1966 case involving a guy named Ernesto Miranda,

97
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.390
it was the Warren court's decisions dealing with criminal justice,

98
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:37.170
like the Miranda case that made him the hire of conservative politicians and a

99
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.510
result in scapegoat for society's problems.

100
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.610
Remember those exploding crime rates.

101
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.230
It wasn't the lack of economic opportunity or access to guns or funding cuts for

102
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:48.120
all types of social services. Nope.

103
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.250
It was all the fault of our man Earl as McCall Belk nap rights before Warren

104
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:54.300
became chief justice.

105
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.130
Few politicians would have thought to blame the Supreme for the crime rate,

106
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.780
but the blame they did and the criticisms lobbied at Warren fuel the satire and

107
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.390
commentary driving bolt dread and Robocop.

108
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.160
So why all the hate it's because Warren's court laid forth an entire new set of

109
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.140
protections for our constitutional rights.

110
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:15.140
When dealing with the police affirming the right to remain silent,

111
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.340
the right to a lawyer,

112
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.510
the right to have that lawyer present during police interrogation and protection

113
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:24.170
from the use of illegally seized evidence critics like of former New York city

114
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:27.680
police commissioner argued that these protections stifled law enforcement

115
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.050
weakening a police force that was already stretched,

116
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.400
dangerously thin unsurprisingly pop culture reflected these anxieties.

117
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.780
Most obviously in cinema,

118
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.620
which depicted endless streams of good guy hero cops who refused to play by the

119
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:42.050
pesky Warren style rules pleasing, you know,

120
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:44.240
the loose cannon who could just get the bad guy.

121
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:47.570
If it weren't for all the red tape in his way, in this context,

122
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.540
who would be the ultimate answer to Warren error restrictions,

123
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.700
the ultimate unencumbered cop.

124
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.600
How about a guy who is perfectly internalized the criminal justice coding and

125
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:00.110
must be trusted to enforce the law fairly, no matter what sounds kind of.

126
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.610
<v 1>This serve the public trust protects the innocent,</v>

127
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.260
uphold the law or this, it goes 36, 13.

128
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.130
<v 2>First degree murder street, judge,</v>

129
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.980
I guess life.

130
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.780
<v 0>Judge Dredd imagines a freed from bureaucracy,</v>

131
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.240
an officer's so thoroughly trained in the law.

132
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.870
He doesn't need a balance of powers to justly, administer it. A copy.

133
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:30.070
Doesn't have to worry about activist judges because he is the judge who won't be

134
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:32.830
stopped by sympathetic juries because he is the jury.

135
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.590
And of course he's also the one handling the punishment.

136
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.040
<v 1>Summary executions by judge dreads.</v>

137
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.720
<v 0>Dread is the platonic ideal of a cop. He isn't driven by emotions.</v>

138
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.793
<v 2>And emotions.</v>

139
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.220
<v 1>There ought to be a log and.</v>

140
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.920
<v 0>Doesn't have any friends that could create a conflict of interest.</v>

141
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.490
He has simply memorized the law and will Dole it out without any bias or

142
00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:58.270
compassion he is to inner city policing and what your Roomba is to midsize

143
00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.860
department vacuuming. Of course,

144
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.090
this is the target of the film's critique without a balance of powers who is to

145
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:06.880
save dread when he's on trial, his own biceps.

146
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.180
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

147
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.480
<v 0>Earlier in the film dread arrest, a spaghetti covered rod Schneider,</v>

148
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:16.620
who was just trying to avoid a shootout. They were killing each other.

149
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.830
<v 1>Could've gone out the window, 40 floors. It would be suicide baby,</v>

150
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.263
but it's legal.

151
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.510
<v 0>Once they later team up, he can't even give deuce big,</v>

152
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.090
lower casual my bed because the law.

153
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.400
<v 1>Can apologize on Robocop. Also.</v>

154
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.120
<v 0>Incorporates many of the defining traits of Lauren's critics is specially the</v>

155
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:36.970
eventual successor to Warren Warren Earl burger.

156
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.260
I know it's too many Warren's in Earl's before he took the other Earl's job.

157
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.740
Berger complained about a drawn-out legal process where criminals could bank on

158
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:48.160
their free lawyer, getting them off on a technical loophole. Of course,

159
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:51.610
many of those loopholes were civil rights protections concocted by the Warren

160
00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:52.000
court,

161
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.880
like the hypothetical drug dealer who gets off because the cops don't have a,

162
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.370
we see hints of this narrative in Robocom like a slimy criminal defense lawyer

163
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:00.204
in the intro.

164
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.990
<v 3>There's murder. It's not like he killed someone.</v>

165
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.020
It's just a clear violation of my client's civil rights,

166
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.310
make it aggravated assault, and I can make bail in cash now. And a guy.

167
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.200
<v 0>Screaming that he's a repeat offender.</v>

168
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.590
<v 3>I am what you call a repeat offender. I repeat</v>

169
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.953
offender again.

170
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.950
<v 0>Sensibly because the justice system can't legally lock him up for good one.</v>

171
00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:25.250
Man who catapulted his career straight into the white house by criticizing

172
00:09:25.251 --> 00:09:30.140
Warren was one Richard Milhous Nixon after an explosion of violent protests

173
00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:33.770
and riots swept the country in the long hot summer of 1967,

174
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.150
soon to be presidential candidate Richard Nixon published an op-ed titled what

175
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:39.350
has happened to America.

176
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.130
One of his scapegoats judges weakening the police's ability to fight cry.

177
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.100
A point that Nixon would continue to repeat throughout his presidency.

178
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.380
<v 4>I believe some of the sessions I've gone to a fall</v>

179
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.480
in the past and weakening the peace forces as against the

180
00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:58.790
criminal forces in our society.

181
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.930
<v 0>In fact is Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong put it in the brethren burger was</v>

182
00:10:02.931 --> 00:10:07.220
chosen by Nixon to lead the Supreme court specifically because of his ragging on

183
00:10:07.221 --> 00:10:11.240
Warren's criminal justice decisions while Robocop and judge Dredd came out well

184
00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:15.380
after Nixon's impeachment is tough on crime and antiwar in court rhetoric

185
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.450
persisted well into the eighties and nineties.

186
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.940
<v 3>Bob.</v>

187
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.520
<v 0>You surprise them that Robocops cartoonishly evil,</v>

188
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.210
backstabbing criminals and judge dreads disintegrating social order seemed like

189
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.880
a warning from this Richard Nixon ad, which tells us.

190
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.110
<v 4>In recent years,</v>

191
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:37.040
crime in this country has grown nine times as fast as population.

192
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.800
<v 0>And to vote like your whole world depended on it.</v>

193
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.730
The idea that civilization itself was being threatened by crime was and

194
00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:47.570
continues to be a common warning and political rhetoric criminals.

195
00:10:47.571 --> 00:10:49.760
Aren't your friendly neighborhood. We delivery guy,

196
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.410
a person trying to make ends meet,

197
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:53.780
or someone pushed into desperation by addiction.

198
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.170
They are irredeemable monsters willing to betray each other at a whim and

199
00:10:57.171 --> 00:10:59.060
destroy their own neighborhood in the process.

200
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.130
When the police go on strike and Robocop,

201
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.710
the city quickly devolves into violent anarchy,

202
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.380
this kind of rhetoric wasn't limited to the likes of Nixon,

203
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.280
how the U S was handling crime continued to be of great public concern in the

204
00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:13.850
eighties and nineties law and order rhetoric research during the Reagan years.

205
00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:16.130
And not because he started a movie of the same name.

206
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.720
Even bill Clinton took a tough on crime stance and Hillary Clinton in 1996,

207
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:24.350
warned of child super predators with no conscience or empathy.

208
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.210
<v 3>They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators, no conscience,</v>

209
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.230
no empathy.

210
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.980
<v 0>There's even a rumor that Hillary screened Robocop for the white house staff,</v>

211
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.580
and then told them, now you go make this happen. That rumor was,

212
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:41.960
of course started right now by me with literally no evidence to support it.

213
00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:45.080
Other than it would be crazy if that happened. Right?

214
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.010
Of course she wasn't the first to accuse criminals of being inhuman monsters.

215
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.710
She was just putting her own spin on familiar rhetoric.

216
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.520
Robocop takes this concept and pushes it to 11,

217
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.480
giving us the least sympathetic villains possible before assaulting a woman,

218
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.980
two men act like zoo.

219
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.813
<v 1>Animals.</v>

220
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.130
<v 0>Well, the dad from that 70 show uses a wounded friend to slow down a police car.</v>

221
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.460
And judge dread the people who exist outside the law are literal.

222
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.020
<v 1>I forgot to mention it. Your new friends,</v>

223
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.710
they're cannibals.

224
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.610
<v 0>Even as a copy of the decline and fall of the Roman empire in his locker,</v>

225
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.910
suggesting the stakes of the war against crime are in his mind,

226
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.550
the decline and fall of the Western civilization.

227
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.610
But these movies are ultimately criticizing this narrative,

228
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.270
even policing with an iron fist, can't save judge dreads, mega cities.

229
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.600
And the most inventive thing this guy has to offer is more executions.

230
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.390
<v 1>The only solution is a tougher criminal code and.</v>

231
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.840
<v 0>And if our criminal justice system could clone perfect cops like dread,</v>

232
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.560
it could do nothing to stop gross abuses of power without a separate judicial

233
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:48.330
system to stop it. Meanwhile,

234
00:12:48.331 --> 00:12:52.470
Robocop through artfully placed commercials suggest that there's a perverse

235
00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:56.580
incentive for the media to report on the chaos of the world so that OCP can

236
00:12:56.581 --> 00:13:00.090
deploy extremely profitable murder robots to save civilization.

237
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.320
The criminal justice system in both films are willing to go to extreme lengths

238
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.670
in the name of stopping perps,

239
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.910
even though they're inflicting a ton of collateral damage with little

240
00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:12.420
consideration for the complexities of criminal activity, these worlds,

241
00:13:12.421 --> 00:13:15.690
both full of law enforcers don't seem very lawful at all.

242
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.610
In other action movies of the time,

243
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.640
vigilante justice is a noble alternative to policing.

244
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.840
If the cops can't get the job done, I will. The good guys kill the bad guys.

245
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:25.920
And everyone goes home happy.

246
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.890
And maybe wondering if there are too many Warren style rules,

247
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.280
obstructing cops from doing their jobs in contrast Robocop,

248
00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:35.550
and judge Dredd are making fun of both the tropes and anxieties of the time.

249
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.181
These films,

250
00:13:36.181 --> 00:13:40.830
satirize romantic notions of good guy cops in a world unencumbered by red tape.

251
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.790
They can also help us ask questions about how and when our desire for law and

252
00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:48.810
order compromises our other values like democracy or the belief in a separation

253
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:50.520
of powers in the criminal justice system.

254
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.280
But what do you guys think are Robocop and judge Dredd,

255
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:56.070
brilliant indictments of tough on crime rhetoric and policies.

256
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.230
Let us know in the comments. Huge,

257
00:13:58.231 --> 00:14:00.540
thanks to our patrons for your support as always,

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.350
thanks for watching and sadistically murdered that subscribe button.

259

<v 1>And remember, I am the law later.</v>
