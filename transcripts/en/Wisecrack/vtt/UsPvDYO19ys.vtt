00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>This video is brought to you by mine.</v>

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.020
Hey, wisecrack, Helen here. So something weird is happening to us.

3
00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:16.700
Sensibly smart public figures lately, public intellectuals. If you will,

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.510
Neil deGrasse,

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.130
Tyson who built a massive platform to spread science literacy has transformed

6
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:26.630
into a weird well actually guy who says very dumb things about philosophy.

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.040
<v 2>My concern there is that the philosopher believes they're actually asking deep</v>

8
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:34.820
questions about nature and to the scientist. It's what are you doing?

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.893
Why are you wasting your time?

10
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.600
Why are you concerning yourself with the meaning of meaning.

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.180
<v 0>Which I am still very mad about Neil,</v>

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.900
then there's your Elon Musk type who has leveraged his fortune and fame to

13
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.100
become a self appointed spokesman on a wide variety of issues or routinely

14
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:52.880
giving out information that is either bunkers or just plain deceptive to the

15
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:57.680
point that he even I a once self-proclaimed Elon Musk fan girl can no longer

16
00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:58.550
stand behind it.

17
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.630
The institutions that publish public intellectuals aren't doing well either the

18
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:05.900
New York times can't seem to go one month without putting out a massively

19
00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.810
ridiculed op-ed from brainy folks like David Brooks,

20
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.630
and then there's the hundreds or thousands or Jesus.

21
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:14.990
I can't even count the amount of YouTube talking heads with hyper dedicated

22
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.980
followings, good and bad. They cover current events and popular culture. Well,

23
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:23.090
it's too diverse a group to describe monolithically and I won't name any names

24
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:24.620
for fear of provoking their legions,

25
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.010
these YouTube public intellectuals might've come across your feeds for,

26
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.890
for instance, not understanding basic human anatomy.

27
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.670
It'd be easy to think that our society is getting dumber or are great thinkers,

28
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:38.000
less rigorous, but that doesn't seem like a fair assessment.

29
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.830
There are some truly great intellectuals out there doing great work still as

30
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.870
chronically online people who like to learn.

31
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.440
We're convinced that there's something severely messed up about how knowledge is

32
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:52.490
created and shared in the 21st century. So what if the grass Tyson's weird,

33
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:55.430
Twitter threads are a symptom of a much larger problem.

34
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.510
And what is the biggest threat to good ideas is not at all what you thought

35
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.350
let's find out in this wisecrack edition on public intellectuals,

36
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.400
what happened. But first here's a bad idea,

37
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.520
letting your personal data float around the internet forever.

38
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.410
This week sponsor is mine.

39
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.060
Mine is a really helpful and free to use smart data assistant these days.

40
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.760
It's easy to feel like your data is out of your hands,

41
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.480
but mine helps you discover where it is and what kind of data is out there.

42
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.610
The process is really simple and quick.

43
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.780
All you have to do is go to same mind.com using the link in the description and

44
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.270
sign in using Google, Microsoft, or Yahoo.

45
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.240
It'll give you a summary of everything that your email is attached to.

46
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.390
You can see how many companies hold your data and see if they're storing

47
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.330
sensitive stuff like identity or financial information.

48
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.010
When you move over to your footprint,

49
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.730
you can see every company that holds your data and the risk of data breach.

50
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.450
There are so many sites I haven't used for years that are still collecting my

51
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:54.350
data, which sucks. So it's great. I can just send a request to have it removed.

52
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.980
Take control of who has your information by looking into mine today,

54
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.270
It is a strange time for our society. Intellectually speaking,

55
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.430
the amount of money flowing into foundations,

56
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.090
both liberal and conservative to produce new and original research is

57
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.410
unprecedented.

58
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.670
Authors are paid tens of thousands of dollars to speak to private and public

59
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:17.020
groups of curious minds.

60
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.490
There are whole conferences dedicated to exploring new and disruptive ideas and

61
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:25.120
places like YouTube have reduced the traditional media stranglehold on the

62
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.800
dissemination of ideas.

63
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.210
If there's a marketplace of ideas where information good and bad gets to Duke it

64
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.780
out for supremacy, one might think this is a kind of golden age,

65
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.890
but not many do so. What's going on to figure that out.

66
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.000
Let's talk about what scholar Daniel Dresner calls the ideas industry,

67
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.870
a vast ecosystem of thought production that stands in contrast to the

68
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.900
intellectual landscape of decades. Past for Dresner.

69
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.100
A public intellectual is a person who comments on a variety of ideas.

70
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.940
They know enough about many things to be able to point out intellectual

71
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:02.110
charlatans. They expose accepted wisdom when it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

72
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.220
And for this, a public intellectual is crucial to democratic discourse.

73
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.820
They span the ideological spectrum. People like William F.

74
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.030
Buckley or trend Russell or James Baldwin. The French love them.

75
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.790
And people like John Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir,

76
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.840
and Michelle Fuko were superstars in the bistro line streets of their native

77
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:20.380
country.

78
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.100
They went on TV and radio and criticized their government's foreign policy.

79
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.330
They would debate about race and racism and so on public intellectual still

80
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:30.580
exist. But for everyone you can name,

81
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.120
there's probably a dozen pseudo intellectuals who come to mind to much more

82
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:36.490
easily. What Dresner calls, thought leaders,

83
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.630
a horrific invention of the ideas industry. You probably know the type,

84
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.220
someone with a big idea, an idea that will revolutionize everything.

85
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.360
If a public intellectual curmudgeonly points out what's wrong with everyone,

86
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:50.290
else's worldview.

87
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.370
A thought leader is an evangelist for their own public intellectuals,

88
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:56.320
tread carefully and weigh evidence.

89
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.490
Thought leaders have a product to sell and sometimes public intellectuals,

90
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.240
our solution to becoming thought leaders themselves enter Amy Cuddy.

91
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.990
Connie is a social psychologist who spent the first few years of her career

92
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.710
doing the normal academic thing, researching publishing thinking.

93
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.120
Then in 2010,

94
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.320
she published a paper suggesting that one's posture could have effects not only

95
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:21.700
on their psyche, but their biochemistry by doing a power pose.

96
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.510
Say a person could not only experience feelings of power,

97
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.540
but raise their testosterone and reduce the levels of cortisol,

98
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.170
the stress chemical in their blood intimidated. Before your big sales meeting,

99
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.210
do a power pose, got an ACE, an exam power pose stuck on dark souls.

100
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.680
Stand up, put your legs in a wide stance and pick that controller back up.

101
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.980
My guy, it's not just a feeding demons though.

102
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.460
Connie and her fellow researchers suggested this simple hack might be of

103
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:51.280
particular use to those who feel chronically powerless,

104
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.700
whether it's because you're the grunt in an organization or because you belong

105
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:59.000
to a social group that has been in scientific terms, screw by society.

106
00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.930
Two years later,

107
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.770
he would go on to give a Ted talk about the topic that will become the platforms

108
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.490
second, most popular with over 40 million views.

109
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.000
The implication of course is that if you're a powerless in society,

110
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.330
the power pose can help you climb to the top of the social hierarchy,

111
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.860
thus combating inequality.

112
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.780
<v 3>And I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it.</v>

113
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.510
She had actually faked it till she became it.

114
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.610
<v 0>Also, Ted talk tickets are between five and $10,000. I don't make the rules,</v>

115
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.860
but Connie is no doubt. An academic.

116
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.550
Her Ted success had launched her into the role of a thought leader. As author,

117
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:35.350
a non geared artist writes in his book,

118
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.820
winners take all her academic work now was competing with a budding speaking

119
00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:41.500
career and a self-help book.

120
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.710
She was named a game-changer by time magazine in 2012,

121
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.090
she had a product and that product was the power pose. Of course,

122
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.410
as an academic, she was interested in other kinds of research that in theory,

123
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.140
she would also like to expose to a wide audience,

124
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.480
but instead of boosting her other work,

125
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.780
her Ted fame did the opposite as Garrett artists' notes,

126
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.440
despite Cadiz rising fame, she found herself in a dilemma.

127
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.520
She was an academic interested in studying the complexities of prejudice and

128
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:12.280
sexism. And yet her Ted talk had drowned out.

129
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.290
Every other thing she had ever said,

130
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.430
and now she was fielding lucrative invitation after invitation to offer her

131
00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:22.690
ideas. The lack of interest in her other work was not exactly a coincidence.

132
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:27.370
Either Catie had made a splash at the idea circuit defined by events like

133
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.320
Ted South by Southwest or the Aspen ideas festivals and made it to

134
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:35.680
the big leagues of the ideas industry at this point,

135
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.550
authors like Dresner and Garrett artists note people like Cutty basically become

136
00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:43.630
paid intellectuals for the kinds of people who can dish out 10 grand to attend a

137
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:47.170
Ted talk in the first place. Once you've been pressed your affluent audience,

138
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.980
you get to give more talks to the executives or staff at Goldman Sachs,

139
00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:51.940
Facebook or Google.

140
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.120
And there was a reason these organizations were interested in Cadiz,

141
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:57.490
other research, their bottom line,

142
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.840
the audiences Catie was speaking to and being paid lucratively by wanting to

143
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:05.680
hear only certain kinds of messages, ones that were disruptive,

144
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.410
just not disruptive to their own place in the world.

145
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.430
The Googles Facebooks and Goldman Sachs of the world are interested in hiring

146
00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:15.880
someone like Cuddy so long as her message is a win-win.

147
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.960
The power pose is a safe solution to say, workplace sexism,

148
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.220
no complex changes to company culture have to occur. And most importantly,

149
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.540
nobody has to lose any money. What is specially moved such audiences?

150
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.070
Your artist's rights was the rendering of social problems as unintimidating.

151
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.940
Bite-sized digestible now Catie isn't some lone Wolf.

152
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.890
She existed missed a ton of names.

153
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:42.040
You probably recognize who write books that end up in airports,

154
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:45.940
give talks at the conferences and get referenced by important people doing

155
00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:47.140
important things.

156
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.010
And their lifeblood comes from the corporate benefactors that like their win-win

157
00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:53.650
mentality and this isn't without consequence,

158
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.090
wherever business school professor,

159
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.110
the Macondo argues that wall street clings to power,

160
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.290
but promoting ideas that promote the rightness of that power.

161
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.980
They reward those that agree with them and punish those who don't.

162
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.480
As Upton Sinclair said,

163
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.770
it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on

164
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:12.060
not understanding it,

165
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.740
the result can be an entire society twisted to serve the interests of its most

166
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:17.700
powerful group.

167
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.900
We can also compare it to someone like Sheryl Sandberg who wanted to offer a

168
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:26.730
win-win solution to sexism by encouraging women to lean in of course,

169
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.990
serious scholars,

170
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.280
Catie included understand that these problems are far too complicated to have

171
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:33.390
any quick fixes,

172
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.770
but complexity is not what the ideas industry is interested in. Honey,

173
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:41.520
isn't getting into the door at the Coca Cola center for civil and human rights,

174
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.080
which is a real thing by asking hard questions about why union leaders in their

175
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:49.260
South American bottling plants have repeatedly disappeared,

176
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.680
but she might get a fat check for explaining to their head of progress.

177
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:56.010
How workers can personally grow by feeling more competent.

178
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.750
Cutting is an interesting example,

179
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:01.920
precisely because she seems acutely aware of these problems becoming a

180
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:03.810
fascinating subject for Giridharadas.

181
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:08.610
His book to document bud Cutty's introspection is not universally present in the

182
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:13.350
many thought leaders speaking to anyone who can cut a 50 grand check and make no

183
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:16.800
mistake. That's really how much some of them get paid historian.

184
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:21.780
Niall Ferguson reportedly received 50 to $75,000 per speech.

185
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.830
Malcolm Gladwell.

186
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.850
<v 4>Also reportedly receives over $50,000 per speech.</v>

187
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.840
<v 0>And if you were mad that Hillary Clinton was getting 200 grand to speak to a</v>

188
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:33.590
bunch of wall street execs, it's common practice for tons of politicians,

189
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.290
including every ex president like George W.

190
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.930
Bush and bill Clinton with the rare exception of Jimmy Carter.

191
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.620
It's not that every idea any of these people ever had is bad.

192
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.980
While we might say, Hey, get paid, who cares?

193
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.780
It creates a perverse incentive for intellectuals and ex politicians to not rock

194
00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:54.050
the boat too hard unless they want to miss out on hundreds of thousands of

195
00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:54.860
dollars.

196
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.420
This incentive also creates an echo chamber of ideas paid for and consumed by

197
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.360
the people running the world. As Gira Darvis writes,

198
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.960
the money can liberate the top thought leaders from the institutions and

199
00:11:05.961 --> 00:11:09.770
colleagues that might otherwise provide some kind of intellectual check on them

200
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.370
while sometimes turning their ideas into advertisements rather than

201
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.990
self-contained work a consequence of an academic receiving these massive payouts

202
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.590
like Ferguson, is that he doesn't have to please his editors.

203
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.930
He sure as hell doesn't have to please scholars.

204
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.620
He has to please corporations and high net worth individuals.

205
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.720
What's more Connie's power pose research. Wasn't very good as good science.

206
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.730
Someone tried to replicate her findings.

207
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.480
They failed for co-author even disowned the study.

208
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.280
The point is this is not the kind of thing the ideas industry cares about.

209
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.990
They want sound bites that make executives feel good, not objective science.

210
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.340
What we're left with is a whole universe of incredibly intelligent people who

211
00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:54.790
have no to criticize the status quo.

212
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.900
They're turned from critics of everything like a public intellectual to thought

213
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:03.370
leaders who are evangelists of not too disruptive ideas for Silicon Valley.

214
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.690
As Dresner writes,

215
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.040
Ted talks are designed for thought leaders to appeal to plutocrats at less than

216
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:13.990
20 minutes, they are mercifully short, a perfect format for potential patrons.

217
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.650
The working rich are busy people operating on a compressed schedule.

218
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.030
You have certainly encountered many trendy ideas secreted by the ideas industry

219
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:23.590
and its corporate benefactors.

220
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.400
The very real and cool practice of mindfulness meditation has been stripped of

221
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:29.760
anything that might matter with worker productivity.

222
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.590
As we discussed in our episode on the topic,

223
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.850
Malcolm Gladwell's idea of 10,000 and ours has come under scrutiny for just

224
00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:39.300
being outright wrong. Then there's something like the four-hour workweek,

225
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.670
which promises your regular economic output.

226
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.200
If you only work four hours by underpaying overseas, personal assistance,

227
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.560
of course, Ted talks and speaking gigs, aren't writing Neil deGrasse.

228
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.790
Tyson's bad takes on philosophy or Allegion of rage filled YouTube screens.

229
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.990
But the public sphere of ideas is being injected by a steady stream of Ted

230
00:12:57.991 --> 00:13:01.770
heads. Leading to shallow takes that make easy targets for long invectives.

231
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.550
We're left debating with a torrent of trash instead of quality ideas.

232
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.630
And the pressures filled by Catie is the same pressure being exerted on smart

233
00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:14.160
people looking to be heard, but we'll get there. It also gives people incentive.

234
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.970
Once they've ascended to prominence, to close themselves off from criticism,

235
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.750
Thomas Friedman has stated he can basically write whatever he wants.

236
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.750
I'm in this scary and enviable position. He said,

237
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.810
I can go to my publisher and say, Oh, I want to write a book.

238
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.660
Here's the check don't. You want to know what it's about?

239
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.890
But the public speaking circuit isn't even the scariest source of our pipeline

240
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:39.720
of garbage ideas for that we have to turn to the think tank American

241
00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:43.080
think tanks started sprouting up in the early 19 hundreds.

242
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.950
As people started wondering if the governor's drinking buddy was maybe less

243
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.620
equipped to deal with trade policy than some kind of expert.

244
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.810
These think tanks claim to be nonpartisan,

245
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.180
although they certainly had their own ideologies.

246
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.600
Some of them are still around today, like the council on foreign relations,

247
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.450
which publishes foreign affairs and the Brookings Institute,

248
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.160
whose goal is to analyze public policy issues at the national level as Dressner

249
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:05.820
rights,

250
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.570
they were there to assist government bureaucrats to work in conjunction with

251
00:14:09.571 --> 00:14:12.990
them. At the same time, they were bankrolled by the very wealthy,

252
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.180
the Carnegies and the Rockefellers of the world.

253
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.360
Well think tanks were never some kind of perfect organization.

254
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.560
Well events in the last few decades have submitted their position as a way for

255
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:25.050
people with a lot of money to launder ideas,

256
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:27.150
to politicians and the public at large,

257
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.990
while the new model might be exemplified by the conservative heritage foundation

258
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.790
under former Senator mint,

259
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.810
it has since gained popularity for liberal and progressive think tanks as well.

260
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.970
Dementia was very good at fundraising,

261
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:44.070
but most notably he had his staff review all heritage papers and to ensure that

262
00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:47.130
they conform to the official policy of the think tank.

263
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.640
It was the success of heritage that would convince people like the billionaires,

264
00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:55.460
Herbert and Marian Sandler to cut a $20 million check to John Podesta to

265
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.340
create the liberal center for American progress.

266
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.140
Like their conservative counterparts.

267
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.520
The center for American progress is about promoting a certain worldview,

268
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.420
not creating rigorous scholarship or thought as the head of the competitive

269
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.570
enterprise Institute told an interviewer groups like ours,

270
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.160
how do we earn credibility?

271
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.180
We have a very strong point of view and we've never deviated from that point of

272
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:17.690
view.

273
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.010
As they grappled with incredibly complex issues like poverty alleviation and

274
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:25.280
fiscal policy, it wasn't the facts driving their conclusion.

275
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.290
It was their preexisting beliefs as author David Callahan summarizes the

276
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:34.850
think tank was invented in the 20th century to offer objective analysis of

277
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.920
complex issues. Now though,

278
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.360
think tanks often operate as the motherships of ideological movements on both

279
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:43.730
the left and the right, these think tanks.

280
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.900
Aren't just thinking in a bubble they're a hugely influential part of American

281
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:52.430
politics. For instance, changes to federal welfare were made in 1996,

282
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.130
after millions of dollars report into research,

283
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.430
arguing that much social spending just made poverty worse.

284
00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.960
And as Callaghan notes,

285
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.460
the foreign policy vision behind the Iraq war was partly made by a think tank.

286
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.240
The project for the new American century. In another example,

287
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:12.290
large sums of money were given by the United Arab Emirates to centers.

288
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:14.480
Think tanks like the middle East Institute.

289
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.530
If think tanks for once a way to provide independent expertise to governments,

290
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.600
they have become a way for a donor,

291
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.780
even a foreign government to influence policymakers.

292
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:28.160
You've probably even been exposed to paid for ideas as you watch TV, YouTube,

293
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:30.140
or scroll through Facebook, for instance,

294
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.880
public opposition to an Iran nuclear deal in 2015 stored after a huge

295
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.200
influx of advertising dollars by interest groups and think tanks if disruptors

296
00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:42.950
and thought leaders seemed so appealing, it might be because many have intuited,

297
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:46.850
a kind of intellectual bankruptcy everywhere in the world lately.

298
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:50.600
It seems like everyone is quick to throw their own facts and figures that tell

299
00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:55.070
exactly their side of the story. It can lead to a kind of factual nihilism.

300
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.120
My facts are objective and yours are created by some shill funded by George

301
00:16:59.121 --> 00:16:59.900
Soros.

302
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.830
And it's entirely likely that the existence of think tanks fuels this problem.

303
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.530
Not that we'd all be able to get on the same page otherwise,

304
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.940
but think tanks have dressed up ideological propaganda as objective studies to

305
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:12.770
return to our Upton Sinclair quote.

306
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:16.970
It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on

307
00:17:16.971 --> 00:17:20.240
not understanding it. This is the marketplace of ideas.

308
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:23.960
That one looking to become a public intellectual must grapple with,

309
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.000
unless they're willing to bend their views.

310
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.100
They're unlikely to survive at a think tank.

311
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.710
They might get a job at a university. However,

312
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.820
the publisher parish model encourages them to not engage with the public.

313
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.900
And instead double down on writing to an audience of a few dozen specialists.

314
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.410
And then there's the internet amidst think tanks,

315
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.640
Ted heads and countless paid for media. There exists podcast hosts,

316
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.100
political commentators, Twitch, streamers,

317
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.780
and bloggers eager to dispense wisdom.

318
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.950
But these things aren't just thinking into a vacuum.

319
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.410
They're developing intellectual brands.

320
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.280
It's the brands of people like Amy Cuddy that allow them to keep raking in

321
00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:05.480
speaking deals or the brands of columnists like Paul Krugman or Bari Weiss,

322
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.140
which rack up book deals. Well, in a sense, this is nothing new.

323
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.950
There are some unique challenges faced by today's would be intellectuals.

324
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.460
There's a growing sense that intellectuals of all stripes are producing

325
00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:19.250
knowledge cynically with a certain agenda in mind.

326
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.400
And if you're looking for the stuff that comes out of policy, institutes,

327
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.890
think tanks and the speaking circuit, you're not wrong.

328
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.470
General distrust toward mainstream ideas,

329
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.630
along with a declining faith in government institutes,

330
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.320
[inaudible] seems to have drawn many of us to outside commentators,

331
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.590
to rogue public intellectuals when everything is broken,

332
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.260
it makes perfect sense to look for an outside perspective.

333
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.670
Elon Musk as a thinker is appealing precisely because America's infrastructure

334
00:18:43.671 --> 00:18:47.630
is crumbling. Maybe you love how he's trying to revolutionize transportation,

335
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.700
or maybe you think he's deeply missed guided,

336
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.840
but most can probably agree that the problems he's addressing our problems to

337
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.310
begin with bill Gates,

338
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.030
both the public intellectual and the person funneling money into intellectual

339
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:00.350
endeavors that fit his worldview.

340
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.940
You can step up to much praise and many accolades precisely because of our

341
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.350
waning public health infrastructure. But what's going on with Neil.

342
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.280
If the marketplace of ideas loves one thing it's competition.

343
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.950
And if you're looking to craft an intellectual brand,

344
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.180
you've got to we'll compete. The rest as David Carr wrote in 2012,

345
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.260
the now ancient routes to credibility at small magazines and newspapers,

346
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.090
toiling and menial jobs while learning the business have been wiped out,

347
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.240
replaced by an algorithm of social media, heat and blog, traction,

348
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.320
social media,

349
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.790
especially Twitter and Facebook have made it possible to very easily quantify

350
00:19:37.791 --> 00:19:41.240
the currency and idea has via engagement in shares.

351
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.800
If I'm getting retweeted more,

352
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.240
I'm being heard more and I'm winning in the ideas industry on my way to book

353
00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:50.390
deals, New York times columns and lucrative speaking gigs.

354
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.600
And while this might be the pinnacle of the marketplace of ideas,

355
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.680
it's also exposed a problem with that market markets are great at finding the

356
00:19:57.681 --> 00:19:59.390
equilibrium of supply and demand.

357
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.470
It can really help me decide how to price my 80 potatoes so I can sell them all.

358
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.730
But this mathematical equation doesn't solve for truth. It does. However,

359
00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:10.880
find out exactly how many people want to retweet Neil deGrasse,

360
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.180
Tyson complaining that a marriage story should be called a divorce story.

361
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.770
The free market of ideas,

362
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.180
often overvalue name brand intellectuals who have long given up on being

363
00:20:20.181 --> 00:20:21.830
insightful dresser explores.

364
00:20:21.831 --> 00:20:25.880
How many intellectuals have taken to hiring a staff who go as far as to

365
00:20:25.881 --> 00:20:29.390
outsource the writing or research of their work for reads a car. Yet,

366
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.920
for instance, has a staff of eight people to run his show and write his columns.

367
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.940
Neil Ferguson has a full-time researcher and undergraduates assisting him.

368
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.480
And in the end it can lead to a serious declining quality.

369
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.200
Most people who are good at being intellectuals are lousy at managing

370
00:20:45.201 --> 00:20:46.034
subordinates.

371
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.590
Dresner argues fittingly in 2012 Zacharia was accused of plagiarism after

372
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:54.100
cutting and pasting from a new Yorker essay. In 2015,

373
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.850
there were dozens of such accusations against him that had piled up.

374
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.780
It shouldn't be surprising that the majority of dialogue happening on YouTube or

375
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:03.430
Twitter is the slam dunk.

376
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.510
Nobody is going around looking for robust ideologies to critique.

377
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.650
They're looking for rubes who make seemingly bizarre claims about feral hogs or

378
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:14.650
Elon Musk, making bad predictions about COVID deaths.

379
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.610
YouTube commentators are looking for the dumbest most outrageous thing to make a

380
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:23.410
video about to soak up easy views. We demand it and they supply it.

381
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.500
It also drives a market of well actually material,

382
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:27.790
but people like Neil deGrasse,

383
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.930
Tyson who can incessantly complain that we're all using the word awesome, wrong.

384
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.920
And on the other hand, there's people like Michael, who can't wait to pithily,

385
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:39.820
leave a response about how dumb his Twitter takes are at the same time as

386
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.650
sociologists will Davies writes,

387
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:46.420
truth has become a kind of war zone that is not very good at finding the truth

388
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.110
truth. He argues comes from dialogue and consensus,

389
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.250
not from a weird fetishization of conflict and debate. When scientists,

390
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.830
for instance are trying to create a COVID vaccine.

391
00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.090
The guy shouting debate me about his theory of microscopic minions is not the

392
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:02.890
missing piece of the scientific puzzle.

393
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.750
There are certainly public intellectual still out there and like all things,

394
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.170
there are good ones and bad ones,

395
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.490
but the actually terrifying thing is how hard it is to navigate where good

396
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:15.820
information is. Even as a chronically online millennial,

397
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.510
I can't help a question. Every single item that comes across my newsfeed.

398
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.760
Is it some thought leader shrieking into the void?

399
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.070
Is it some paid for think tank study,

400
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:27.910
but what do you think has the rise of the thought leader ruined intellectual

401
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:32.170
discourse? Is Twitter making any search for objective truth? Impossible.

402
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.090
