00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.500
<v 1>Hey, wisecrack, Jared here.</v>

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.400
It's with a heavy heart that I tell you all that I'll be stepping down from

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.270
wisecrack. At the end of September, it's been an amazing journey.

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.440
I have learned so much during these past eight years because of all the great

6
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:22.280
teachers, artists, experts I've collaborated with over the years,

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.750
I've become a much more thoughtful,

8
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:27.740
compassionate and inquisitive person building wisecrack from scratch with my

9
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:31.670
co-founder. Jacob has been the most rewarding experience of my life thus far,

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.790
Jacob and I met in college and moved to Hollywood with the dream of making

11
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:37.970
movies together and ended up kind of falling into the YouTube game.

12
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.810
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

13
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.260
<v 1>Other than movies, one thing we were both passionate about was education.</v>

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.350
And if one could think of our business partnership as a marriage,

15
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.210
then wisecrack was our baby.

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.350
It was an exhausting experience of high highs and low lows,

17
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.710
but it was because of wisecrack that I was able to eventually quit my soul

18
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:00.200
crushing job of editing corporate videos for a living.

19
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.650
I will always be so grateful to the fans for allowing that to happen.

20
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.160
I'm not leaving because of any juicy drama like Takeshi kind of sheroes

21
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:09.050
character set in the Chungking express.

22
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.180
Everything has an expiration date even love, but you all need not worry.

23
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.420
I'm leaving the channel in the incredibly capable hands of my right hand,

24
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.310
Alec who has helped me shape and edit over 300 videos over the past four years.

25
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.380
The future is a little uncertain for me,

26
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:27.410
but I have to remember that's part of what makes life exciting, right?

27
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.330
If you guys want to keep up with what I'm up to,

28
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:31.910
you can follow me on Instagram at father of Woody,

29
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.600
but it's mostly just pictures of my dog. I want to thank all the writers,

30
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:40.010
researchers, designers, motion graphics, artists, teachers, eight bit animators,

31
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:43.580
illustrators, cinematographers, sound, engineers, production assistants,

32
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:48.020
makeup artists, actors, hosts, directors, editors, podcasters,

33
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.040
and producers that have helped on the project over the years. Honestly,

34
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:55.180
there are so many of you. This would have turned into a much longer video.

35
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.180
I tried to name you all, but you all know who you are and I love you all dearly,

36
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.490
but most of all, I want to thank you. The fans for sticking with us without you,

37
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:08.420
we would have never made it this far, especially our patrons. Thank you.

38
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.000
Thank you. Thank you for all your support.

39
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.830
It means the world to me and as always, thanks for watching guys. Peace.
