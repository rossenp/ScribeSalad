00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.670
<v 0>Hey wise, crack timing can be weird.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.280
When we started working on this video about V for vendetta,

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.910
we really didn't expect its release to feel so eerily timely.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.130
The film is obviously not a perfect or even close metaphor for this moment V the

5
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.820
leader of the protest movement to picked it in the film is extravagantly violent

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.871
in real life.

7
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:22.770
Overwhelmingly peaceful protests continue in the wake of the brutal murder of

8
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.310
George Floyd by the police. We hope that you're making your voice heard.

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.790
We also hope that you're able to do so safely and that you take care of your

10
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:32.850
mental health during this difficult time. Thanks guys.

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.890
Hey, wisecrack, Jared here today,

12
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:44.030
we're talking about the vaudevillian veteran cast vicariously as both victim and

13
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:47.240
villain by the vicissitudes of faith. It's V for vendetta.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.690
The film based on the graphic novel of the same name was met with generally

15
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.560
positive reviews and relative box office success. But the graphic novels,

16
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:55.730
curmudgeonly creator,

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.960
Alan Moore was left unimpressed by Hollywood translation of his work describing

18
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:04.010
the film as a deep fanged version of the original. So is Alan Moore, right?

19
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.320
Or just very grumpy at detective comics.

20
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.610
Let's find out in this wisecrack addition on V for vendetta deep or dumb,

21
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.970
and of course, spoilers ahead for the film and the graphic novel.

22
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.650
Our guys let's do a quick recap.

23
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.160
We start out with a news monologue delivered by the voice of London,

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.310
Louis [inaudible], who explains the current state of affairs.

25
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.980
A mysterious plague has spread across the world,

26
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.530
turning the United States into a leper colony.

27
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.510
And now 20 years later is what the world's biggest Napa colony and

28
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:36.350
provoking radical changes in Britain led by dictator Adam subtler.

29
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:40.940
The far-right Norse fire party has transformed Britain into a police state that

30
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:45.050
runs on complete obedience and conformity while a combination of state

31
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:48.820
propaganda and secret police managed to keep most of the country compliant with

32
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.300
seller's authoritarian regime. One man rises up to oppose it. The,

33
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.310
the film follows V and his ward slash not totally consensual mentee, Eby,

34
00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:02.540
Hammond as V blows up symbols of British law and assassinates party members who

35
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:03.374
have wronged him.

36
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.120
But these final masterpiece is a revolution itself as is very calculated.

37
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:12.260
Acts of terror inspire the masses to rise up against their fascist leaders.

38
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.530
Let's first start with what the film and graphic novel have in common.

39
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.400
These fixation on symbols, whether he's talking to lady justice,

40
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:22.760
blowing up symbols of British authority or wearing a guy Fox mask,

41
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.810
the guy seems to see symbols as a key to cementing political authority,

42
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.210
rather than just the violence of Jack booted men.

43
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.850
The antidote to those symbols are counter symbols,

44
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.310
ideas and art as Evie reminds us.

45
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.850
<v 1>To tell the truth while politicians use them to cover the truth.</v>

46
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.410
<v 0>And his shadow gallery is basically a Noah's Ark of outlawed ideas.</v>

47
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.880
The film even takes some of this farther as EVs friend Dietrich hides a Koran

48
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.630
and protest art. He also gets all Benny Hill in his mocking of subtler.

49
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.763
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.570
<v 0>Even as Dietrich is dragged away by the secret police and VI dies.</v>

51
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.800
It's clear that their ideas will outlive them, but while this conceit is plenty,

52
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.630
[inaudible], it's not like more, the film have really reinvented the wheel here,

53
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.280
maybe dramatized it. Well,

54
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.390
this brings us to a small choice in the film that ends up drastically during its

55
00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:22.770
meaning of the North fire party comes to power in the movie and like many,

56
00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:24.660
a real life authoritarian regime,

57
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.220
North fire presents the idea of a glorious more homogenous past the country has

58
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:33.660
lost by deviating from traditional values. Britain once had a strong,

59
00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:35.820
proud national identity they claim,

60
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.530
but it has been diluted and polluted by modernity diversity and sin using a

61
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:42.270
swastika like red and black symbol,

62
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:45.330
which includes the Christian Cross North fire presents itself.

63
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.650
As the antidote to chaos. Sutlers motto is strength through unity,

64
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.460
unity through faith or strength through purity, purity, through faith,

65
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.140
as it's phrased in the graphic novel,

66
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.020
which also explicitly links the motto to the Roman fast.

67
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.700
She's a bundle of wood that cannot be broken unless divided this simple forceful

68
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:06.420
slogan continually reinforces the notion that the country is strong when

69
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:09.990
everyone lines up behind the leader and lives, according to his rules,

70
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.711
consequently,

71
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:14.370
anyone who does not offer complete obedience is an enemy of the people.

72
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.270
The pursuit of personal freedom becomes an attack on the very fabric of society.

73
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.480
This country back into chaos at a glance,

74
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:25.620
this anti-authority and tales seems like exactly what Alan Moore would hope for

75
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:28.860
from a cinematic adaptation of his work. So what's his beef.

76
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.580
So much of Moore's identity as an artist has revolved around interrogating the

77
00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:36.990
idea of power and how it's used in particular has worked is largely about the

78
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:40.620
dangers of any one person wielding great power, whether they're naked,

79
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:41.910
blue superhumans like Dr.

80
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:45.450
Manhattan or oppressive dictators like subtler or Susan,

81
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:49.530
as he's named in the book while director James McTeague adaptation holds true to

82
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:50.790
the rejection of authoritarian.

83
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.300
The issue more found was that it makes it all too simple.

84
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.890
The film's world is separated clearly into evil tyrants and virtuous rebels.

85
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.300
That much of the graphic novels nuances lost Moore's V for vendetta was not a

86
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.760
clear cut case of good against evil,

87
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.870
but a battle between authoritarianism and anarchism by contrast.

88
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.120
And the movie is just authoritarianism versus honest people that brings us

89
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.070
Norris fires rise to power in the graphic novel,

90
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:20.280
a global nuclear war between the Soviet union and the United States in the

91
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:23.640
eighties has reduced much of the world to an irradiated. Wasteland.

92
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.330
Britain is spared by the war, but finds itself in a state of crisis.

93
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:31.410
Afterwards when the resulting nuclear winter causes a famine out of the chaos

94
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:35.580
that follows the North fire party rises to power in the movie, however,

95
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.270
a viral pandemic, rather than a nuclear war lays the groundwork.

96
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.520
This new plate kills thousands in Britain,

97
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.910
and it's reported to have all but destroyed the U S as in the book,

98
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.500
a crisis creates opportunity and the North fire party is able to seize control.

99
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.440
At first glance. This might seem like a superficial change.

100
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.220
The point in either case is that a period of global turmoil creates widespread

101
00:05:56.221 --> 00:06:00.680
panic and leading the British public to turn to a zealot like subtler fear

102
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.800
followed by apathy has allowed the country to fall under the spell of a

103
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.800
right-wing strong man as VI explains fear.

104
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.100
<v 2>I got the best of you, but in your panic,</v>

105
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:11.740
you turn to the now hi chancellor Adams.

106
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.440
<v 0>However, it's later revealed that the virus,</v>

107
00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:18.220
which ravaged Britain was in fact intentionally released by settler and his

108
00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:21.340
cronies to force the country into accepting their leadership.

109
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.210
<v 2>Know virus, the most terrifying virus you can,</v>

110
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.790
and very much in the you and you alone, nothing.

111
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.030
<v 0>The point is that in the films version of the story,</v>

112
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.990
the British people were essentially duped Norse fire didn't rise to power by

113
00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:37.990
winning the honest support of the masses foot by fooling them,

114
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.550
contrast that with the graphic novel,

115
00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:41.920
in which the Wars that devastated the world were real,

116
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.300
many of the problems were real.

117
00:06:43.301 --> 00:06:48.220
And the public was all too willing to turn towards fascism racism and homophobia

118
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.360
V for vendetta was born out of Moore's own experience of life under someone whom

119
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.630
he considered to be a hard-right zealot, Margaret Thatcher,

120
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.290
having watched the iron lady when the support of his countrymen more was under

121
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:03.460
no illusions as to how popular these politics could be. The film, however,

122
00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:06.130
makes the populace significantly less blameworthy.

123
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.050
The people are basically good.

124
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.920
Turning a three book graphic novel series into a two hour movie was always going

125
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:13.270
to require some streamlining.

126
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.050
So we can't really blame them for cutting out some of the fascist propaganda or

127
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:17.980
entire scenes,

128
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.880
but far more concerning the movie arguably loses the moral ambiguity of the

129
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:25.360
graphic novel in Morris telling the government officials who send people to

130
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:29.500
concentration camps are also people with families, desires, ambitions,

131
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.920
jealousies, et cetera. They're three dimensional. In contrast,

132
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:36.730
the film reduces North fire to a cabal of cartoonish villains in a dark room,

133
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.820
simplifying the moral and political implications of the story.

134
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.380
Fittingly the movie show seller mostly as a big brother S ominous talking head,

135
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.480
rendering him, literally two dimensional.

136
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.200
He's no longer the complex weirdo who falls in love with a computer from Alan

137
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:52.660
Moore's version. The film's message becomes this.

138
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.590
There's a small set of clear bad men amongst a sea of good people.

139
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.610
All it takes is one brave hero to help overthrow them and things can be set

140
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:02.410
right again, in the graphic novel,

141
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:05.320
the North fire members are of course still awful,

142
00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:09.190
but they're at least presented as fully rounded human beings ranging from true

143
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:11.320
believers in Norse fire, xenophobic, creed,

144
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.510
to those who are just following orders.

145
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.320
The graphic novel actually takes pains to show us the private lives of these

146
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.311
North fire members,

147
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:21.460
people who go to church and raise families and goof around at work.

148
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.090
The point of course is not to say that these are good people within this fascist

149
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:29.320
organization, just that they are people reducing them to comic book.

150
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:31.630
Bad guys might be more comfortable for the viewer,

151
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.550
but it shies away from their reality.

152
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.390
And just as North fire leaders have been exaggerated into one note, bad guys,

153
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.890
the himself is noticeably softened and simplified for the big screen in the

154
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:43.660
movie, V is an egg frying,

155
00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:47.800
slow dancing charmer with a love of romantic movies and Shakespearian plays.

156
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.630
He kills in cold blood. It's true,

157
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.380
but as victims are so outlandishly awful that this never seems like too much of

158
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:54.430
a moral compromise.

159
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.020
The movie may claim that the monstrous things that were done to him turned VI

160
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:01.920
into a monster, but that's not really what we see in the graphic novel. However,

161
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:06.600
V is considerably less dashing the mask he wears isn't just to cover his scars,

162
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.790
hide his identity, or create a symbol.

163
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.470
The static unfeeling face it presents is a representation of who V is trying to

164
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:17.100
become. And the guy Fox grimace sneaks its way into panels of Norse,

165
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:21.390
fire members suggesting these method isn't so far removed from the people he

166
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:25.560
wants to destroy because his victims aren't all painted as cartoonish villains

167
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.030
were forced to reckon with the extreme cost of political violence like subtler.

168
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.290
He's ultimately a man.

169
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:35.220
So convinced of his own ideology that he'll do whatever it takes in pursuit of

170
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:39.630
it. So what we have is not a battle between forces of pure good and pure evil,

171
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.290
but between a proponent of authoritarianism and an agent of anarchies.

172
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.610
So let's talk about anarchies perhaps the biggest change to these character lies

173
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.070
in what he actually wants at the beginning of the movie,

174
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:52.110
before the old Bailey courthouse explodes,

175
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.530
he delivers a speech which outlines exactly what he hopes to achieve.

176
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.610
<v 3>It is to Mme. Justice, that I dedicate this concerto in honor, of the holiday.</v>

177
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:06.020
She seems to have taken from these parts and in recognition of the impostor

178
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.610
that's stands in her step.

179
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.710
<v 0>V turns himself and specifically his mask into a symbol of true incorruptible</v>

180
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:13.940
justice in doing so.

181
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:17.630
He hopes to remind people that such a thing can still exist if they come

182
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:21.350
together and fight for it, he tips his hat to the statue of lady justice,

183
00:10:21.351 --> 00:10:21.861
as he does.

184
00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:25.520
So acknowledging both what she stands for and how those values have been

185
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:29.030
corrupted by settlers brutal and dishonest machine. Ultimately,

186
00:10:29.031 --> 00:10:32.210
he is pledging loyalty to the concept of justice itself.

187
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.720
The V of the graphic novel also has a conversation with lady justice,

188
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:37.370
but it plays out quite differently.

189
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.420
We begin by making a formal introduction between the two of them while voicing

190
00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:42.254
both roles.

191
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.370
This might suggest that he's not quite so mentally composed as his onscreen

192
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:47.720
counterpart from the start.

193
00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:51.770
Their conversation is filled with odd sexual undertones framing, lady justice,

194
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.390
as V's childhood crush,

195
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.710
things then quickly turn nasty as VI accuses her of cheating on him with Norris

196
00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.520
fire's leader,

197
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.600
painting himself as a jilted lover with a score to settle V is established here

198
00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:05.600
not as a noble freedom fighter coming to the nation's rescue,

199
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.290
but as a deeply damaged man with a thirst for vengeance that borders on the

200
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:10.010
erotic,

201
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.430
perhaps what is most telling about the scene is that it echoes an earlier moment

202
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:17.330
in which North fire's leader outlines his racially pure vision for Britain's

203
00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:21.530
future and explains his belief in fascism. Just like with these conversation,

204
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.520
what begins as a statement of political ideology quickly descends into an angry,

205
00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:29.720
personal diatribe with the unsettling sexual undercurrent after lamenting the

206
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:32.120
fact that he's never been with a woman in real life,

207
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.960
Susan moves on to personifying his political ideal fate as a woman.

208
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:40.340
He is in love with just as VI does with lady justice while V and subtler are

209
00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:41.960
polar opposites in the film,

210
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.170
the novel uses these scenes to draw an eerie parallel.

211
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.070
Both men are driven by personal grudges and primal desires.

212
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.610
What's most significant though is how the conversation between V and lady

213
00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:57.400
justice with V cutting ties to Liberty and pledging allegiance to anarchy.

214
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:01.150
Instead, he talks about his dream of turning Britain into the land of do.

215
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:01.984
As you please,

216
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.290
the name taken from a children's story by Enid Blyton in his view,

217
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.950
the complete obliteration of government and law will allow everyone the freedom

218
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:11.170
to live their lives. However, they see fit.

219
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.410
The dangers of anarchism are not lost on more, however,

220
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.840
with no government to enforce the laws that are in place,

221
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.600
it's also possible that we enter a Darwin, a state,

222
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.440
or those with the greatest capacity for violence rule over those around them.

223
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.560
Although this isn't exactly different than your life under Norse fire.

224
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.250
Vee also has a term for this, the land of take what you want,

225
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.870
but the chaos can give way to a kind of anarchic order where people voluntarily

226
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:37.300
submit to the ideals that control their behavior.

227
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.830
This argument is near and dear to more a self-professed anarchist Moresby,

228
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:42.461
even in folks,

229
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:46.630
the German word for order or knowing which evokes the system of rules used by

230
00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:49.270
self-governing Amish communities, but in the film,

231
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.350
any ideas of anarchy ultimately disappear except for a quick allusion to a

232
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:55.790
misquote of the famous anarchist, Emma Goldman.

233
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.390
<v 1>Without done single cell revolution, not.</v>

234
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.070
<v 0>Worth having. And a man yelling</v>

235
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.830
what's important is that the graphic novel ends with no clear answer as to where

236
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.260
things will go from here, V is dead.

237
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:12.010
And while he successfully blows up number 10 Downing street in one last act of

238
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:15.520
defiance, it's unclear what effect this gesture will have on the nation.

239
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:19.870
At large, the film's ending is much more of a crowd pleaser while V still dies.

240
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.170
His final act has clearly inspired the country around him.

241
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.520
The sea of guy Fox masks watching on as Westminster burns are proof that the

242
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.150
British people have woken up to the true nature of the North fire party and are

243
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:34.270
ready to take back their country. The bad guys are dead.

244
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:39.190
The good guys won authoritarianism as the novel understands is not something

245
00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:42.430
that arises because a small group of evildoers hatch a plan,

246
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.230
it rises out of the country itself championed by large sections of the public.

247
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.460
The movie sidesteps the difficulty of this truth to provide a brighter breezier

248
00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:53.200
version of good conquering evil.

249
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.830
Ultimately the movie is considerably less deep than the source material,

250
00:13:56.831 --> 00:14:00.250
but it still has enough substance to save it from a full dumb verdict.

251
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:04.540
It cleverly depicts the way authoritarian governments control their citizens by

252
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:08.200
manipulating the flow of information and offers some interesting thoughts about

253
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:10.150
the power of symbols in our society.

254
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.450
So pretty deep and maybe important formatively.

255
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:16.810
If you're a teenage Jared in the end, we're left with the same question,

256
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:18.970
which V poses to the people of the UK.

257
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.660
Do we want an inspiring story about good triumphing over evil?

258
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.770
Or are we ready to take a harsh look at where that evil comes from in the first

259
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:28.750
place? Let us know which thing in the comments.
