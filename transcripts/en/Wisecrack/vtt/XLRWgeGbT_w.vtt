<v 0>This video is brought to you by Vessey footwear.</v>

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.950
What's up wisecrack Michael,

3
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:14.360
here to talk about the most contentious issue of 2021. So divisive,

4
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:18.800
it could destroy the fabric of society or at the very least to wreak havoc on

5
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:19.760
your local Costco.

6
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.130
<v 1>You come in close back off.</v>

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.210
<v 0>That's right.</v>

8
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.920
We're talking about masks or that humble six by nine inch piece of fabric that

9
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.630
manages to bring thousands of grownups.

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.850
<v 1>To tears. And they want to throw God's wonderful breathing system out the door.</v>

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.170
<v 0>This potentially life saving piece of cloth that obscures approximately</v>

12
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:43.610
56.2% of your face is causing drama all over the country.

13
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.620
Especially amongst my fellow,

14
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:50.360
Florida men and by and large viral videos of these masculine masses have yielded

15
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:52.190
widespread derision from the Twitterati.

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.930
But what if this is the wrong strategy as people fundamentally obsessed with

17
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.590
both not catching the plague and slam dunking on pseudo-science. We,

18
00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:04.280
a wisecrack are left wondering our shame and ridicule the answer.

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.300
How can we encourage our fellow Wawa patrons to hide their beautifully shaped

20
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.040
mouth?

21
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.200
<v 1>Say you left Walla. I did because of the voluntarily,</v>

22
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.820
because I refuse to wear them.

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.880
<v 0>Yes, believe it or not. This is not a new problem.</v>

24
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.110
Public health interventions have been inconveniencing and annoying Americans for

25
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:25.160
years, whether we're being told to smash safely, stop exhaling,

26
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.320
secondhand smoke, or wear a seatbelt.

27
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.590
So some volunteer firefighter doesn't have to scrape you off the side of the

28
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:34.640
road, but what public health officials learned from decades of trying to make

29
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:38.000
Americans behave, let's find out in this widespread condition.

30
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.140
America hates masks now, but before we continue,

31
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.960
I'm want to give a shout out to Vesey footwear for sponsoring this video a

32
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:47.510
little while ago, they sent over these gray cityscape sneakers.

33
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:49.850
And as a sneakerhead, I was excited to test them out.

34
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.000
You see Vesey shoes are 100% waterproof.

35
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.180
And while I'm not experiencing that much rain in Southern California,

36
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.210
I thought these could be perfect for when I do end up going home or on long

37
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:02.690
trips vessels are the perfect everyday sneaker. They are lightweight,

38
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.520
stretchy and made of diamond text material,

39
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:07.250
which is a dual climate knit material that regulates temperature,

40
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:10.940
no matter where you are, the best part is when you purchase a very Vesey shoes.

41
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.280
You know, your money is going towards something great.

42
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.570
Since the start of this global pandemic investee has donated over 300,000 masks

43
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:21.050
to frontline workers and they continue to give back to the community to check

44
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.210
out their page, to see how they're being active. Right now,

47
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.880
back to the show masks have been warned to STEM the spread of diseases to

48
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:37.730
varying degrees of success. Since the 17th century,

49
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.390
when the resurgence of the Movantik plague had doctors looking like the stuff of

50
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:42.920
nightmares, fortunately,

51
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:46.670
modern doctors prefer the more scientifically grounded and less terrifying

52
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:48.590
surgical or in 95 masks.

53
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.250
Now for a quick primer on how masks work in regard to COVID.

54
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.360
Every time you open your gross pie hole, you spew invisible,

55
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.980
disgusting droplets of your inner filth. When you're after mentioned,

56
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.710
filth includes tiny COVID-19 particles.

57
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.120
These droplets can make your fellow human sick masks worn correctly.

58
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.350
Block these droplets, preventing others from inhaling your disgusting lung Jews.

59
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.210
And that's probably why most Americans are wearing masks at least once per week,

60
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.980
which okay. Is better than nothing among the complicated and contentious issues.

61
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:22.060
Our country faces.

62
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.470
This one seems like it should be about as controversial as please wear pants.

63
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.640
And Denny's so why the furious response to being told to cover your face,

64
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.430
hope to understand America's mask phobia.

65
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.480
Let's look back at the last time we were asked to wear masks, not on Halloween,

66
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.370
the 1918 to 1919 influenza outbreak, AKA the Spanish flu.

67
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.350
It was a devastating pandemic, ultimately afflicting around 500 million people.

68
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.340
Then one third of the world's population, it was super fatal,

69
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.660
particularly for healthy 20 to 40 somethings afflicted countries relied on many

70
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.250
of the same public health strategies.

71
00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:02.080
We grumbly follow today like neurotic hand-washing and canceling every fun house

72
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:03.130
party, except, you know,

73
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:05.860
they didn't have Netflix or zoom trivia to help their sanity.

74
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.090
And then there were the gauze masks while they'd become a common site in

75
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:14.440
American hospitals mask wearing by the masses was among the most novel public

76
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:16.630
health practices introduced during this pandemic.

77
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.520
According to historian Nancy Toms,

78
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.030
as the flu spread public health authorities across the country,

79
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:24.310
encouraged people to make and wear these masks.

80
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.040
And some cities even passed laws requiring them.

81
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.490
San Francisco issued such a mandate in October,

82
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.600
1918 with detractors being subject to a fine or up to 10 days, imprisonment,

83
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.800
many other cities and States attempted to do the same,

84
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:41.220
but were stymied by resistance from city council officials or boards of health

85
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.060
as explained by university of Michigan, Jay Alexander Navarro,

86
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.340
and in places where laws were passed,

87
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.200
they sometimes caused quite a stir interestingly Navarro notes that it was mass

88
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.100
ordinances rather than the very strict lockdowns that seemed to have provoked

89
00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:58.590
the most anger from the masses in response,

90
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.310
local governments were met with intense defiance sound familiar.

91
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.490
One is specially interesting parallel between the two pandemics though lies in

92
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:12.690
who was wearing masks and who wasn't according to a U S national library of

93
00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:16.860
medicine report. Men were the weak links in hygienic discipline in 1918,

94
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.530
a newspaper article from the time paints a picture.

95
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.250
The average man wear the mask slung to the back of his neck until he came inside

96
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:24.084
of a policeman.

97
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.630
And most people had holes cut into them to stick their cigars and cigarettes

98
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:31.320
through recent polls have shown similar mask wearing reluctance amongst men

99
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:35.010
today making the Spanish flu error response to masculine dude bros,

100
00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:36.780
particularly instructive for us.

101
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.700
So how did we deal with these mustachioed cigar chewing rebel babies in

102
00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.530
response to male mask phobia,

103
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.430
public health officials adapted a more modern manly form of public health.

104
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.520
Steve didn't discipline patriotism and personal responsibility.

105
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.100
We see this ethos and in 1919 ad,

106
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.700
which features a masked guy urging the public to stamp out the Spanish,

107
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.190
you know, the way manly men do these patriotic efforts,

108
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.820
piggybacked of a massively successful world war one ad campaign,

109
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.820
which invokes the civic duty required of every American,

110
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.620
an ad from the red cross.

111
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.790
Even warned that the man woman or child that will not wear a mask now is a

112
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.870
dangerous slacker.

113
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.070
Similarly American vaccine campaigns over the years have also framed getting

114
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:21.980
vaccinations as a patriotic duty quite successfully,

115
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.870
particularly when it came to eradicating polio and make no mistake efforts to

116
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:31.220
convince Americans to Don Macs were largely effective as a story in John and

117
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:32.180
Barry writes in his book,

118
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:36.140
the great influenza mask were seen everywhere and will become a symbol of the

119
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:36.974
epidemic.

120
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.940
A wide network of churches and charities developed to produce masks and millions

121
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:42.410
of Americans made their own at home.

122
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.850
A gauze covered face became a not particularly sexy symbol of your patriotism.

123
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.871
And I know,

124
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:51.950
I know getting someone to help other people so that they feel like a man is a

125
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:56.810
very weird ask, but Hey, if it works, can we get the old spice guy in on this.

126
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.550
<v 2>Biggest possible when your man smells like old spice and not a lady I'm on a</v>

127
00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:01.450
horse now.

128
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.090
<v 0>It's important to note that mass squaring in 1919,</v>

129
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:08.380
wasn't a magic bullet experts have advanced different theories as to why mask

130
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:10.510
didn't effectively stop the spread of influenza.

131
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.990
Like people made masks and then wore them incorrectly,

132
00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:17.770
or they didn't wash them enough where they'd remove them while socializing.

133
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.940
<v 2>No and address don't you shoes in store. What else? Project it's your birthday.</v>

134
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.870
It is not my birthday.

135
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.700
<v 0>That makes sense.</v>

136
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.410
Also influence it travels in much smaller airborne droplets can COVID-19 making

137
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:30.760
it harder to block for the mask.

138
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.480
But I digress because we're talking about how to get people to wear masks,

139
00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:35.590
to protect against something.

140
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:39.400
They can actually stop the spread of the novel coronavirus,

141
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.400
despite successful appeals to patriotism and Manliness.

142
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:43.870
During the influenza pandemic,

143
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.880
there were still plenty of griping and complaining,

144
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.320
particularly in places where masks became legally mandate. Most infamously,

145
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.400
there were the 2000 or so detractors who formed the San Francisco anti mask

146
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.670
leak. But even those who will bade were thoroughly annoyed.

147
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.790
When the mask order was lifted in San Fran, after mere weeks,

148
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.080
everyone collectively cheered and tore their masks off leaving the sidewalks and

149
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.930
Reynolds strewn with the relics of a torturous month.

150
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.950
Clearly Americans have a lot of feelings about the combined indignities of

151
00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:15.880
wearing a mask and being told what to do this led scholar, Laura Spinney,

152
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:20.590
to suggest in her book about the 1918 pandemic that people have a low tolerance

153
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:21.940
for mandatory health measures.

154
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.960
And what's more that such measures are most effective when they're voluntary,

155
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.780
when they respect and depend on individual choice.

156
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.080
And when they avoid the use of police powers and other words,

157
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:36.220
it's sometimes better to inform citizens with the facts about masks, vaccine,

158
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.210
seatbelts, et cetera.

159
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.810
So as to arm them with information so that they do the right thing,

160
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.380
there's probably a lot of you watching this who don't drink and drive because

161
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:48.730
it's a Dick move that could kill somebody rather than out of a specific fear of

162
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:49.564
getting arrested.

163
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.950
Recent evidence suggests that mandates can increase compliance for masks wearing

164
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.330
seatbelts and vaccinations.

165
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.460
Even if public health experts typically prefer education over enforcement,

166
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.590
indeed Spinney notes that a 2007 CDC pandemic policy suggested

167
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.350
relying on voluntary compliance with public health measures,

168
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.750
less mortality rates exceed 1%.

169
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.250
The point is there's a limit to how far playing nice will go for the CDC when

170
00:09:14.251 --> 00:09:15.450
confronting death.

171
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.830
It's also important to note that even if we can successfully get most people to

172
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:23.970
wear masks, it's useless if they do so incorrectly. This was a huge problem.

173
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:25.020
During the Spanish flu,

174
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.990
tons of people were crappy masks and they wore them wrong.

175
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.330
Besides the after mentioned cigarette holes,

176
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.310
the very idea of which makes my head flowed people used inadequate materials

177
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:38.970
like cheesecloth, or they exposed their noses or they recycled dirty masks.

178
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.810
We're obviously seeing a similar problem today with mask bales,

179
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:44.730
plaguing everyone from nose breathers,

180
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:49.350
to people wearing valve mask that filter air coming in while expelling

181
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:53.100
disease they're out for everyone else to enjoy. Arguably,

182
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.550
this could be combated with more robust messaging about the correct kinds of

183
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:58.740
masks to wear and exactly how to wear them.

184
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.490
Particularly given that Americans are accessible by more methods of

185
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:04.020
communication than ever before.

186
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.010
Like why wasn't this YouTube video annoyingly prefaced with a federally

187
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:11.400
sponsored public health commercial telling you to cover your mouth and nose.

188
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.470
So we're also protected from the COVID molecules,

189
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:17.100
camping out in your buggers and why isn't the government making fun Twitter

190
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:21.060
videos about hand-washing all in all the 1918 pandemic demonstrates that

191
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:24.450
education should be our first line of defense against pandemics.

192
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.890
The influenza pandemic offers a really simple one-to-one comparison for

193
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:31.350
examining America's mask phobia. However,

194
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:35.220
it's also worth examining another more recent public health education effort,

195
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.420
the HIV AIDS epidemic and resulting campaign to increase condoms.

196
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.260
Look at the early years of this crisis and you'll see parallels to our current

197
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:44.930
predicament. First and foremost,

198
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.520
there was an entirely new virus to educate people about.

199
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.650
<v 3>In a healthy individual.</v>

200
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.870
There are twice as many T helper cells as T suppressor cells in people with age,

201
00:10:53.871 --> 00:10:55.100
this ratio is reversed.

202
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.791
<v 0>Secondly,</v>

203
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:58.820
the federal government basically ignored it and hoped it would go away.

204
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.510
Whereas in the spread, thirdly, people who took it seriously were often mocked

205
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.520
Even by president Reagan's own press secretary who responded to one reporter's

206
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:15.440
questions about AIDS by intimating,

207
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:18.200
that the reporter was himself infected with the virus.

208
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.393
<v 4>Okay.</v>

209
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.710
<v 0>American government was deadly silent about the virus for years.</v>

210
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.580
There were worldwide public health efforts attempting to promote awareness in

211
00:11:31.581 --> 00:11:35.030
the early eighties, mostly by seriously freaking people out.

212
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.530
Some ads went so far as to use imagery of tombstones and grim reapers.

213
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.730
As researchers from population action, international found such campaigns.

214
00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:48.500
Hadn't provided information about HIV AIDS nor suggested new behaviors effective

215
00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:50.870
in preventing HIV, acquisition or transmission.

216
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.940
And essentially only increased fear.

217
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.620
This approach would be echoed later in the decade by some American government

218
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:00.190
sponsored ads. And it was probably really not smart.

219
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.520
That's not because fear categorically doesn't work.

220
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.660
I won Michigan state meta analysis of fear-based public health messaging shows

221
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.040
the ads that aggressively appealed to fear actually can be highly successful so

222
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:15.700
long as they are accompanied by the message that people can take effective steps

223
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.440
to protect themselves. However,

224
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.100
fear based ads like our green Reaper that don't empower people to protect

225
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:25.090
themselves are counterproductive resulting in defensiveness or denial.

226
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.930
Similar studies have come to the same conclusions about anti-drug ads like the

227
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.040
infant. And this is your brain on drugs, which offers the viewer.

228
00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:36.150
No suggestions on how to take personal action rather than spurring people to

229
00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:40.680
change their behavior. Relying purely on fear seems to make people shut down.

230
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.570
Maybe even giggled don't have sex cause you will get pregnant and die,

231
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.890
but AIDS education, wasn't all death incarnate early on in the epidemic.

232
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.970
activists stepped up to fill the void created by U S governmental and action and

233
00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:55.110
widespread homophobia.

234
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.430
These activists took public health education into their own hands. For example,

235
00:12:59.431 --> 00:13:03.930
one 1983 pamphlet made by activists pioneered the concept of safer sex

236
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.650
teaching specific behaviors that could drastically reduce people's risk of

237
00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:12.090
contracting AIDS without stamping out their sex lives entirely such messaging.

238
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.440
According to public health scholar,

239
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.850
taszlin J padamsee was oriented towards changing individual behavior by

240
00:13:17.851 --> 00:13:19.560
transforming community norms.

241
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.430
Most specifically by turning condom use into a common practice for gay men,

242
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.330
such community-based educational efforts were according to [inaudible]

243
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.410
remarkably effective at stemming the spread of the disease. Accordingly.

244
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.520
These independent efforts establish some best practices in public health that

245
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.490
continue today specifically by encouraging simple,

246
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:42.840
clear directives targeted towards those who most need to receive the message in

247
00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:46.560
contrast America's government sponsored AIDS campaigns in the mid to late

248
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:46.981
eighties,

249
00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:51.360
focused on the message that anyone can get AIDS without specifying the critical

250
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:54.630
fact that certain groups faced a disproportionate risk here,

251
00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:58.020
we see the way public health messaging made by members of the community for

252
00:13:58.021 --> 00:14:02.430
their community can be remarkably effective and can even kickstart wider public

253
00:14:02.431 --> 00:14:03.240
health efforts,

254
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.740
which is probably partially why you maybe receive somewhat comprehensive sex ed

255
00:14:07.741 --> 00:14:09.330
in school. In other words,

256
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.900
teaching people how stuff works is a really good idea.

257
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.630
Some might say it's the basic foundation on which to do this.

258
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.410
This channel was founded and of course it's messy and tricky and tiring.

259
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.400
There are some people who will not be convinced by any amount of evidence that

260
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.860
this Facebook post is not scientific fact.

261
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.490
And there are times when you have to take extreme action, like barring someone,

262
00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:32.700
the joy of picking up Kung Pao cauliflower in order to make them behave

263
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:35.910
responsibly at least temporarily. But regardless,

264
00:14:35.911 --> 00:14:40.290
we should probably at least try to educate our friends and loved ones to please

265
00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:45.000
for the love of God, cover your disease holes, but in a nice way. Well,

266
00:14:45.001 --> 00:14:48.690
what do you guys think would nationwide messages about masks that stress our

267
00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:51.000
patriotic and moral duties be more effective?

268
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.790
All the Twitter shaming in the world,

269
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.900
or as getting this guy to wear a mask is simply impossible.

270
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.390
Let us know you think in the comments. Huge,

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.260
