00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.601
<v 0>Hey everyone.</v>

2
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:04.050
This video was done in collaboration with our good friends over at the tape,

3
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.550
stick around until the end of the video,

4
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:08.370
to hear more about their deep dive into princess, Carolyn

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.550
What's up wisecrack, Jared. Again, in case you missed it.

6
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:19.250
Two of our favorite shows in recent memory wrap this year,

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.190
the good place and BoJack horseman. Now on paper,

8
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:24.230
these shows might seem very different.

9
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.920
One's a feel good show about a ragtag team of dead people trying to save

10
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.600
everyone from member flattening. Hell.

11
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.010
<v 1>Maybe if you score negative points on earth, I'm sorry. You blew it.</v>

12
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.570
Enjoy having your penis flattened.

13
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.630
<v 0>While the other one is about, well, this prick, maybe.</v>

14
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.150
<v 1>Some of the troops are heroes, but not automatically.</v>

15
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.070
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

16
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.410
<v 0>But what if I told you that if you dig a little deeper,</v>

17
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:49.160
these shows actually approach the same philosophical topic from opposite

18
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:52.130
perspectives. Oh dear. As it turns out,

19
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.460
both the good place and BoJack are preoccupied, not just with death,

20
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.580
but with how the big slumber gives meaning to our lives.

21
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.740
So in the words of everyone's favorite Florida, man,

22
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.070
let's hook them all top cocktail the thing and see what happens.

23
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.680
Logan was wisecrack condition on two ways to die,

24
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.840
the good place and BoJack horseman.

25
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.070
And as always spoilers ahead now for the uninitiated,

26
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:16.340
the good place has a lot of twists and turns over its four seasons.

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.330
The show started as a story about humans mistakenly ending up in heaven only to

28
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:23.930
surprise us with the revelation that their good place was. In fact,

29
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.820
an intricate plot to torture them.

30
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.810
But after getting a surprisingly good looking demon on their side, hello,

31
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.420
silver Fox, the show follows the gang.

32
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:35.000
As they try to change the rules that govern the afterlife.

33
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.850
That's because the current system is seriously broken.

34
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.030
<v 2>And this is the problem with the current system live anything less than the most</v>

35
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:44.480
exemplary life. And you are brutally tortured forever with no recourse.

36
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.260
The cruelty of the punishment does not match the cruelty of the life.

37
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:49.100
That one has lived.

38
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.170
<v 0>To fix the problem. The judge kind of like a pseudo God with a daddy complex.</v>

39
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.380
Wow.

40
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.130
<v 1>Last time I checked, I didn't have a dad.</v>

41
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.290
That's why I'm attracted to all the father figures on the TV shows. I watched.

42
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.980
<v 0>Wants to erase humanity and start from scratch.</v>

43
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.370
But the gang manages to convince her and the folks down in the bad place to

44
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.470
adopt a new system. You die,

45
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.110
go to the afterlife and then go through a series of tests.

46
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:16.430
Before you move on to heaven.

47
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.750
<v 2>Again,</v>

48
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.710
you were given a sort of evaluation and the architects explain what you did

49
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:25.730
badly, what you did well, and then you get rebooted and do it again.

50
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.760
And again and again until you ACE, it.

51
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.510
<v 0>All's well, that ends well, right? Not so much. Well,</v>

52
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:35.150
the gang may have stopped all humanity from going to hell.

53
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:37.340
That doesn't mean that heaven is all that great.

54
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.560
In the words of Hypatia of Alexandria.

55
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.390
<v 3>Paper, this is paradise. All your desires and needs are met,</v>

56
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.960
but it's infinite. And when perfection goes on forever,

57
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.350
you become this glassy-eyed mushy person.

58
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.850
<v 0>Living forever is kind of its own hell. So Eleanor has a solution.</v>

59
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.220
<v 1>The way to restore meaning to the people in the good place is to let.</v>

60
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v 2>Them leave.</v>

61
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.950
<v 0>In other words, for your afterlife to have meaning you too must die,</v>

62
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.910
or in this case, cease to exist. The show wraps up with our heroes,

63
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.720
all doing what they need to feel at peace before shuffling off this immortal

64
00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:13.620
coil. Now,

65
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.710
if you think it's strange that a show about the afterlife ends with everyone

66
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.100
essentially dying, that's probably because you're not familiar with this guy.

67
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.110
<v 2>Mortality offers meaning to our lives and morality helps navigate that</v>

68
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.380
meaning.

69
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.680
<v 4>Wait,</v>

70
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.850
what I think it says is that mortality offers meaning to the events of our life.

71
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.190
<v 0>Nice that dude, right there is Todd may.</v>

72
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.500
Who's not only a professor of philosophy,

73
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.240
but also a philosophical advisor to the show with Pamela Harami it's May's book

74
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.080
death that actually provides the philosophical framework for the series ending

75
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.940
in it may make the bold claim.

76
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:49.140
That the fact that we die is the most important fact about us. For me,

77
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.380
death provides a unique structure to our lives with death,

78
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:55.680
subsuming all other facts about our lives without death.

79
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.510
He argues we would all lose a sense of meaning and maybe even virtue to prove

80
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:04.500
the point may ask us to consider Jorge Luis bore has this short story via

81
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:05.130
mortal,

82
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.790
which follows a man named Joseph [inaudible] in search of a river that grants

83
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.653
and mortality.

84
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.110
But when cartel is finally drinks from the river and discovers the society of

85
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:16.320
immortals, he's shocked to find that they're just apathetic,

86
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:19.410
husks of former humans. They barely talk show,

87
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:23.340
strikingly little interest in others and wander about in the literal ruins of

88
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:26.010
their own civilization. If this sounds familiar to you,

89
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.890
maybe that's because it reminds you of this delightful character in the good

90
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:31.560
place. Paul T-ball what's your favorite positive.

91
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.500
<v 4>Yeah, I mean, it's perfect. We're all having orgasms literally all the time.</v>

92
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.890
I died a Virgin. So that's real crazy.

93
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.040
<v 0>Because there's nothing that the residents of the good place haven't done or</v>

94
00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:46.590
will not eventually do during that eternity.

95
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.690
Nothing provides them meaning or joy.

96
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.820
Even the literal constant cosmic orgasmic bliss or go-karting with monkeys.

97
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.190
<v 2>Donkeys are the ideal go-kart opponents.</v>

98
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.490
They're funny enough to give the finger, but not smart enough to win.

99
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.661
<v 0>Perhaps worse.</v>

100
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:04.140
This unending life seems to also strip people of their identities.

101
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.120
Hypatia of Alexandria, for example,

102
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:09.330
becomes the exact opposite of an erudite ancient philosopher.

103
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.430
She swaps her Toga for an NFL Jersey,

104
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.700
goes by the name Patty and has totally forgotten the name of her former

105
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:15.534
profession.

106
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.220
<v 2>Where are you? What's it called a, um, a think book, man.</v>

107
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.720
Um.

108
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.020
<v 0>But it's not just our passions that eternity would numb may sites,</v>

109
00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:25.860
fellow philosopher,

110
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:29.760
Martha Neusbaum and speculating that eternity could even chip away at our moral

111
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:33.900
concerns going so far as to speculate that even justice would be imperiled.

112
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.530
The needs of others would not urge themselves on us in the same way since their

113
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:39.990
existence would not be threatened by our neglect.

114
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.770
This is certainly the case in bore has his story where car topless relates,

115
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:47.370
how a man was left at the bottom of a ravine for almost a century because no one

116
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:49.410
could be bothered to get him out after all.

117
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:53.010
Why rush when you have until the end of time and while the good place didn't

118
00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:56.580
quite bear this thesis out. It's interesting to note that after an eternity,

119
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.490
Chidi who made moral philosophy,

120
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:02.660
his whole life on earth and the afterlife was no longer interested in studying

121
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.800
the subject. Once he got to.

122
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.030
<v 4>The good place. After a thousand times of reading,</v>

123
00:06:07.031 --> 00:06:09.940
the most difficult writings in the world have acquired a new passion,

124
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.040
garbage books.

125
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.600
Do you think it would have been a good symbologist here's that learner real job.

126
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.561
<v 0>But the good place.</v>

127
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.970
And Todd may both agree that eternity is a less than great everything needs an

128
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.540
it may, for his part, asks his readers to consider a novel,

129
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.330
a book concluding isn't important in and of itself.

130
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.120
Literally every book in existence has a final page,

131
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.020
but this ending itself lets you reflect on what came before and gives you a

132
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:39.430
chance to order that experience. Or we can consider your typical TV sitcom.

133
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.730
The fact that there's a final scene to each episode, isn't surprising,

134
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.570
but building to that end allows the episode to have a narrative drive and a

135
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:48.640
sense of closure for the good place.

136
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:52.390
The knowledge of finality allows the show and its characters to create meaning

137
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.440
the chance to walk through a door of non-existence allows Jason to feel complete

138
00:06:56.441 --> 00:07:01.030
when he played the perfect game of Madden after over 400,000 tries and it allows

139
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.540
Chidi to feel at peace when he and Eleanor sit down for their last dinner

140
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:06.850
together as Michael paraphrases, Eleanor.

141
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.500
<v 4>You said that every human is a little bit sad all the time because you know,</v>

142
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:12.334
you're going to die,

143
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.600
but that knowledge is what gives life meaning.

144
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.320
<v 0>But if all of this seems a bit overly well optimistic,</v>

145
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.260
then maybe BoJack horseman. His perspective would speak to you more.

146
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.580
After all BoJack has spent six seasons deconstructing the idea that anything in

147
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:30.670
life can be neatly wrapped up, let alone in the face of death.

148
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.840
<v 1>It's funny, isn't it?</v>

149
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.190
The things that matter the truth is none of it matters.

150
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:39.490
And the truth is it all matters tremendously.

151
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.760
It's a wonder any of us ever get out of bed at all.

152
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.920
And yet we get out of bed.

153
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.980
<v 0>And the final half of season six is no different.</v>

154
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.370
While BoJack seems to have turned a new sober leaf as a drama teacher at

155
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:54.340
Wesleyan, everything goes South for him. When two Intrepid,

156
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.520
1930 style reporters start poking around his past.

157
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.560
<v 1>This last story is taking its sweet time.</v>

158
00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:02.410
But once we can tie down this boat plus house fellow to Sarah Lynn on the night

159
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:03.850
of her death wield, are you broke you on the phone?

160
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.630
<v 0>Well, it begins as a story about BoJack's involvement in Sarah Lynn's death,</v>

161
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.590
quickly spirals into a PR nightmare with BoJack getting grilled for all his

162
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.600
horrible behavior on national TV.

163
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.110
<v 1>When she was intoxicated, you had sex with her. And when she was sober,</v>

164
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.850
you gave her the heroin that killed her.

165
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.130
Then in an effort to cover for yourself,

166
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.490
you waited to call the paramedics that might've saved her life.

167
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.670
<v 0>One relapsed later complete with a near death experience.</v>

168
00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:31.390
And one of the best dream sequences on television and BoJack has been sentenced

169
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:33.100
to 14 months in jail.

170
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.130
The series ends with BoJack being released for a night to attend princess

171
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:37.000
Carolyn's wedding,

172
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.740
where he must accept the fact that life doesn't have any rhyme or reason he just

173
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.380
simply has to get by. Yeah. Well, what are you going to.

174
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.270
<v 4>Do? Life's a. And then you die, right?</v>

175
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.710
<v 1>Sometimes, sometimes life's a. And then you keep living.</v>

176
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.000
<v 0>It's that last sentence that really encapsulates the philosophical essence of</v>

177
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.570
the show. Life's a. And then you die.

178
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.500
Or sometimes you just keep on living. Unlike the good place.

179
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:04.020
There are no clear cut endings in BoJack horseman,

180
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.590
no real moments to get a greater sense of closure. Sure.

181
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.010
BoJack might make a big gesture of change at the end of one season,

182
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.550
whether it's saving Todd from an improv Colt or showing kindness to his mother

183
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.680
on her death bed, but he always slides.

184
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.850
<v 5>This place was supposed to be a fresh start for me.</v>

185
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.810
Rehab was supposed to be a fresh start, no matter how many starts I get,

186
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.560
there's always the same ending. Everything falls apart. And I end up alone.

187
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.450
<v 0>Put endings in BoJack offer little to no meaning. So it's not too surprising.</v>

188
00:09:32.451 --> 00:09:33.530
Then that death,

189
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.210
the end of all ends is likewise treated as a frightening meaningless, unknown.

190
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.170
This all hearkens back to the early French variety of existentialism to

191
00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:44.600
paraphrase the original bad boy of French philosophy.

192
00:09:44.601 --> 00:09:48.320
John Paul Sartre humans are created without any specific purpose.

193
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.460
Unlike toilet paper,

194
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:52.970
which is obviously made to be bought and hoarded like precious gold.

195
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.990
We enter this world without any rhyme or reason and only define ourselves

196
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.920
afterwards.

197
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.000
But whatever one finds in their quest for meaning it's all for not as the cosmic

198
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.880
curtain comes to a close, some existential nihilist,

199
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.820
even go a step further and say, why bother searching at all?

200
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.550
And the words of philosopher, Donald Crosby, stretch,

201
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:12.410
fret and dilute ourselves as we may,

202
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.210
our lives are of no significance and it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning

203
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:22.190
where none can be found while existential nihilism is as far away as possible

204
00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:24.380
from Todd May's argument, that death gives life.

205
00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:27.920
Meaning it's been a constant staple for BoJack. In fact,

206
00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:31.400
death punctuates almost every season with the deaths of herb.

207
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.480
Because as Sarah Lynn and BoJack's mother all causing BoJack to hit new

208
00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:39.350
emotional lows and subsequently scrambled to make sense of his life.

209
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.920
<v 5>I don't know how to be. Diane doesn't get better and it doesn't get easier.</v>

210
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.880
<v 0>Season six, where the show really drives the existentialist message home.</v>

211
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.260
Particularly in the episode, the view from halfway down after BoJack relapses,

212
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:54.140
he breaks into his old home. It takes a bunch of pills, drinks,

213
00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:57.710
a bunch of vodka, and then has a near death experience while drowning.

214
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.580
<v 2>Finally made it to a little soiree. Yeah.</v>

215
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.120
<v 5>Having this dream where I was having dinner with all the people who were gone</v>

216
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:07.010
and I thought I shouldn't do that.

217
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.670
<v 0>In the dream. BoJack has dinner with all the people he knew who died.</v>

218
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.230
Also Zach Braff.

219
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.570
<v 5>The waiter water. Thank you, Zach breath.</v>

220
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.630
What starts as a dinner game about the best and worst parts of the game.

221
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.320
<v 0>Characters lives quickly devolves into a conversation about the value of these</v>

222
00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:22.154
lives.

223
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.910
Sarah Lynn insists that all the joy she brought her fans must mean something

224
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.650
while corduroy Jackson, Jackson,

225
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.800
you know the guy who hanged himself while jerking off and sucking on a lemon,

226
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.010
says it can't equal. BoJack's uncle's sacrifice.

227
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:39.380
<v 2>You sing in songs on stage. It's the same thing as this guy who died liberated,</v>

228
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.330
we can't compare apples to Auschwitz.

229
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.111
<v 0>Notably,</v>

230
00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:45.530
this isn't the structured kind of philosophical conversation we would see play

231
00:11:45.531 --> 00:11:48.980
out in the good place or an answer or resolution has always found at the end of

232
00:11:48.981 --> 00:11:52.700
22 minutes. Instead there's no agreement, no answers here.

233
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.990
BoJack's father represented by secretary. It says it best.

234
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.360
What they did with their lives. Didn't matter.

235
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.060
<v 5>All the time those people spent trying to do good or help people would be</v>

236
00:12:03.061 --> 00:12:07.320
something. I did none of that. And yet here I am. Same as them.

237
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.340
<v 0>Regardless of what they did on earth or who they were, they all died.</v>

238
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.050
Any attempts to create meaning or to find peace or just desperation.

239
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.580
<v 5>Piece that someone trying to convince himself as something of what the life has,</v>

240
00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:24.870
meaning or purpose, that, that if you check the right boxes and do the dance,

241
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:28.110
then you get a little part and get to the end frame certificate that says,

242
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.510
congratulations. You've got peace.

243
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.010
<v 0>Of course, BoJack is anything.</v>

244
00:12:32.011 --> 00:12:34.860
But at peace when he realizes he won't be waking up from the stream.

245
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.790
<v 5>Not coming, Oh, this is always the part where I wake up. You all go to the show?</v>

246
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.620
Zach Braff says, pardon my reach.

247
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.190
Even though he can clearly get my plate from another angle, then I wake up. Oh,

248
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.180
okay.

249
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.050
<v 0>Instead BoJack joins the others for a literal show. One by one,</v>

250
00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:51.840
the characters perform artistic rendition of their deaths.

251
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.960
Sarah Lynn sings a song about how you shouldn't stop performing until you're

252
00:12:54.961 --> 00:12:59.520
dead corduroy, uh, hangs himself and secretary at slash BoJack's.

253
00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:03.600
Father reads a haunting poem about jumping off the bridge, thrash.

254
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.100
<v 5>To break from gravity.</v>

255
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.790
What now could slow the drop highlight,

256
00:13:08.791 --> 00:13:11.100
give for toast to touch the safety packet time.

257
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.140
<v 0>At the end of all of these performances,</v>

258
00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:15.840
the characters exit through a door of non-existence.

259
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.380
But this door isn't the serene wooded variety we see in the good place.

260
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.670
It's an abyss.

261
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.690
It's a stark contrast where the good place strives to tell us that death will be

262
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:26.550
peaceful and that you'll go willingly.

263
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.600
<v 1>Will happen when we go through it. Well,</v>

264
00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.190
we don't really know exactly.

265
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.200
All we know is it will be peaceful and your journey will be over.

266
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.420
<v 0>BoJack implies that it's terrifying and you're going whether you want to or not.</v>

267
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.420
Now, while it might be tempting to chalk this all up to BoJack's traders,

268
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:50.730
being a bit more artistic in their visions of death.

269
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.880
These choices are actually integral to existentialism.

270
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.030
Most existential has argued that if meaning exists in the world,

271
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.720
it is an entirely human construct. According to Sartre,

272
00:14:00.721 --> 00:14:02.340
when we perceive the world around us,

273
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:05.250
what we're actually doing is trying to impose order upon it.

274
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.570
He writes it's our presence in the world, which multiplies relations it is.

275
00:14:09.571 --> 00:14:13.110
We who set up this relationship between this tree and a bit of sky.

276
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.550
Thanks to us. That star,

277
00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:18.270
which has been dead for millennia that quarter moon and that dark river are

278
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:21.570
disclosed in the unity of a landscape. More importantly,

279
00:14:21.571 --> 00:14:25.860
existentialists argue that this mental process is what allows humans to be free.

280
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.230
Sure. There's no grand purpose to our existence,

281
00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:31.350
but that doesn't mean we can't attempt to create one for ourselves.

282
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.130
And the artist who distills their vision of the world onto a canvas or a stage

283
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.110
is perhaps the most free of all.

284
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.730
It explains why so many existentialists like Sartre Camou and Beauvoir were also

285
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:45.630
playwrights. And it explains why herb tells BoJack this during his dream.

286
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.880
Has anyone ever come back from this place?

287
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.550
<v 1>There is no place.</v>

288
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.840
<v 4>It's just your brain going through what it feels like it has to go through.</v>

289
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.320
All you can do right now is sit back and enjoy the show.

290
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.540
<v 0>This was real. It's simply BoJack creating art from his life.</v>

291
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.240
Trying to impose order in the end,

292
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.410
BoJack has to come to the sobering realization that this is it.

293
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.130
<v 4>You on the other side, hope BoJack. No,</v>

294
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.300
there is no other side. This is him.

295
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.630
<v 0>Of course, BoJack doesn't actually die. And maybe that's the point.</v>

296
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.190
Think back to May's point.

297
00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.190
The idea that death gives structure and meaning to a life,

298
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.630
if a person never died, if the book never ended, if the show just went on,

299
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.080
then at what point would we be able to sit back and ask ourselves?

300
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.090
What does it all mean? Ultimately,

301
00:15:40.091 --> 00:15:43.930
the good place chose the sitcom ending one where the characters all completed

302
00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:45.640
their journeys and found peace.

303
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.100
Even if that meant their existence is coming to an end.

304
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.530
<v 6>I just suddenly had this calm feeling like the</v>

305
00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:58.270
air inside my lungs was the same as the air, outside my body.

306
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.093
It was peaceful.

307
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.240
<v 0>In BoJack. The show ends, but the journey continues even BoJack.</v>

308
00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:06.760
Doesn't really know what he's going to do or how it's going to beat.

309
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.930
<v 6>But it's easy now in jail. I don't have to make any choices for myself.</v>

310
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.640
I worry about what's going to happen.

311
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.500
<v 0>We keep coming back to that line from the final scene. Sometimes life's a.</v>

312
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.680
And then you keep living in the last scene.

313
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.250
BoJack confronts the reality that he'll never totally make things right with

314
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:28.750
Diane, but even so life will go on as approving, proving the point,

315
00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:29.920
the last moments of the show.

316
00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:33.580
Aren't uncomfortably long shot of the two sitting awkwardly next to each other

317
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.580
in silence. So here's the million dollar question wise,

318
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.130
crack and asking how death affects life.

319
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.770
Why did the good place end on simple answers?

320
00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:44.980
And why did BoJack end with open questions? Strangely?

321
00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:48.280
I think the answer lies not necessarily in the shows themselves,

322
00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:50.650
but in their creators and more importantly,

323
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.430
their mediums after all the good places, the baby of Michael. Sure.

324
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.790
One of the most influential figures in American television. Sure.

325
00:16:57.791 --> 00:17:01.660
Cut his teeth on the American office before creating parks and rec Brooklyn

326
00:17:01.661 --> 00:17:05.440
nine, nine, and the good place. In other words, he's an honest to God,

327
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:10.240
sit-com genius, but sitcoms as a form have their own narrative demands.

328
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.200
Dan Harmon said it best. When he wrote that TV, isn't selling revolution,

329
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.060
it's selling a hygienic relatable substitution for your own filthy unmarketable

330
00:17:19.061 --> 00:17:19.894
humanity.

331
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.620
The trick that television plays is that it swaps out any meaningful and

332
00:17:23.621 --> 00:17:27.910
therefore potentially television subverting truth with the basic eternal truth.

333
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.920
That change is unnecessary.

334
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.940
Ultimately the traditional TV model is focused on placating audiences.

335
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.560
TV wants to make you feel good,

336
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.800
even safe about your lives that you'll watch more TV.

337
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.160
The last thing he wants to do is create an existential crisis,

338
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.530
but this is exactly what BoJack horseman does.

339
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.410
And it's precisely because the man behind the show Raphael,

340
00:17:47.411 --> 00:17:51.420
Bob Wachsberg is not from Hollywood. In fact like many existentialists,

341
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.840
Bob Wachsberg is a playwright by training. And as a result,

342
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.010
BoJack oozes theatricality, the episode time's arrow, for example,

343
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:03.210
freely draws on theater inspirations like Harold Pinter and Carol Churchill by

344
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:07.440
depicting Beatrice's dementia as her mixing and mashing various moments of her

345
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:08.070
life.

346
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.870
Another episode free chiro is essentially a one man show a 20 minute monologue

347
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:15.810
in which BoJack delivers a eulogy about his mother Beatrice.

348
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.290
And it's also one of the top TV episodes of all time on IMD.

349
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.580
Be given Bob Wachsberger pension for theater and all its existential baggage.

350
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.860
It's not surprising that BoJack has shoes,

351
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.050
the easy answers and happy endings of networks.

352
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.330
<v 5>TV closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.</v>

353
00:18:32.331 --> 00:18:36.650
It's like true love. And the Munich Olympics doesn't exist in the real world.

354
00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:40.780
The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward. In the end.

355
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.710
<v 0>We get a very interesting dichotomy.</v>

356
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.290
The good place attempts to be a show about philosophy.

357
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.810
Even the starting premise for people stuck in hell,

358
00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:50.150
torturing each other is inspired by John Paul.

359
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.930
Sartre's famous play no exit yet because of the shows sitcom routes.

360
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.860
It's bound to answers that can easily fit the sitcom mold of clean endings.

361
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.670
It wants to Sue thus with the traditional sitcom logic that it's all going to be

362
00:19:01.671 --> 00:19:05.090
okay. As long as we have our friends or as Chidi puts it,

363
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.380
We should just be excited that any show network television or otherwise is

364
00:19:15.381 --> 00:19:16.730
willing to talk about content.

365
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.600
<v 1>You reading the metaphysics of morals by Emmanuel Kant.</v>

366
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.470
It's a treatise on the aesthetic preconditions of the mind's receptivity to

367
00:19:24.471 --> 00:19:25.130
duty.

368
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.250
<v 0>The other hand, BoJack horseman is the exact opposite of the good place.</v>

369
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:32.000
It's a show set in Hollywood that because of its theater roots ends up being

370
00:19:32.001 --> 00:19:35.990
about philosophy. And to be sure we never get the answer to a lot of questions.

371
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:36.950
Is there meanings?

372
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.270
The damage we experience are we doomed to always be the people we are now and.

373
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.100
<v 5>Stars and celebrities? What do they know? Do they know things let's find out.</v>

374
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.690
<v 0>But in all seriousness,</v>

375
00:19:47.691 --> 00:19:51.080
just as the show leaves us uncertain about how BoJack's journey will go.

376
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.930
It leaves us uncertain about the meaning of life, death,

377
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.210
and any other deeper philosophical questions.

378
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.810
And in that there's a certain genuineness and authenticity that the good place

379
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.710
lacks still itching to learn about every nook and cranny of BoJack horseman

380
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.370
genius.

Be sure to check out the takes video on the only person who somehow stayed

it explores the working woman trope she embodies and her unique relationship to

384
00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:14.864
storytelling.

385
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.740
