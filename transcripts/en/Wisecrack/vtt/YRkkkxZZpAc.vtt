<v 1>What's up, why's crack Jared here.</v>

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.600
You might've noticed that nobody can agree on what a reliable news sources

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.200
people have been accusing the news of getting worse, more partisan,

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.970
more divisive, more alert.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.980
And as people accused news outlets of slant spin bias or outright fake news,

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.610
it's worth asking, can the news ever be truly impartial?

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.640
And where did the idea of objective news even come from?

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.550
So today we're going to see if we can answer these questions in this wisecrack

10
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:36.690
condition on can the news be objective before we begin?

11
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:38.220
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor.

12
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:42.600
Ground news ground is run by a small team of seven Canadian independent industry

13
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:46.020
outsiders with the mission of fighting against the rise of misinformation,

14
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:48.060
sensationalism and bias news.

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.050
It's an app that allows you to see the same news story as covered by every news

16
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.090
outlet from the far left to the far right.

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.380
And everything in between on the political spectrum bias is clearly labeled for

18
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:01.950
every new source using bias ratings from independent nonprofit monitoring

19
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:06.600
agencies in a world where objectivity is hard to define much less find

20
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.321
ground news,

21
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:10.620
lets you come to your own conclusions by showing you the perspectives and takes

22
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.600
from a wide range of news media.

23
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.440
Check out news from over 40,000 local national and foreign news outlets and be

24
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:20.070
aware of the diverse opinions and straight up BS that other people around you

25
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:22.440
will be sharing with you over awkward conversations.

26
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.280
The app is free to download and is available on iOS and Android.

27
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.120
And now back to the show it's worth defining objectivity very quickly.

28
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.150
So we're going to use Merriam Webster's definition of objectivity,

29
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.260
which is the lack of favoritism toward one side or another and freedom from

30
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.550
bias. In other words,

31
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.640
to report the news subjectively means to recount the goings on in the world

32
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:45.570
without a specific agenda to promote or a favorite politician to support.

33
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.290
We also need to figure out where the idea of objective news comes from because

34
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:53.820
it's a fairly modern phenomenon for most of Western history, print publications,

35
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:57.690
like pamphlets were just another method of the King or landowner passing down,

36
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:00.960
whatever he wanted his subjects to know or a method for the church to

37
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:02.250
communicate with the faithful.

38
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.520
But this started changing in the 18th century as the philosophies of the

39
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:08.430
enlightenment work, their ways into all aspects of culture,

40
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.260
including news publications,

41
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860
just as artists and scientists use the enlightenment principle of reason to

42
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.980
explore the world untethered from God in the aristocracy.

43
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.090
So two did news publications that sprung up to offer accounts of social and

44
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:22.110
political affairs.

45
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.400
And this offered a new perspective on the role of objectivity in the press as

46
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.730
the same enlightenment principles that tried to understand the natural world

47
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.050
without bias were used to understand society or so they thought

48
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.951
philosopher,

49
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:38.850
Terry Eagleton has discussed the complicated early days of the free press in his

50
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.530
book, the function of criticism,

51
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.920
which begins with an account of two of the earliest English papers,

52
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.130
the spectator and the Tatler. According to Eagleton,

53
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.270
both of these papers used moral correction and secure ridicule to offer

54
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:55.230
criticisms of the aristocracy that would have previously gotten writers locked

55
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:57.030
in a dungeon at first glance,

56
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.180
it would seem like this new freedom would an objective type of journalism that

57
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:05.790
could inform regular citizens about current Vince. But according to Eagleton,

58
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.970
these publications were far from objective. And in fact,

59
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.930
they largely serve the purpose of the emerging bourgeoisie while creating an

60
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.710
acceptable way to offer criticisms of the ruling class.

61
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.840
What was even capable of being said,

62
00:03:18.841 --> 00:03:21.930
Eagle to note was defined by England's ruling block.

63
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.640
The very ability to participate in the disinterested debate of English papers

64
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.660
usually meant that one had to be a landowner too. Ironically,

65
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:34.680
that only those with an interest can be disinterested. In other words,

66
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.380
the debate disagreements and coverage of these patients,

67
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.970
we're all predicated on people who were impacted partially trying to grease the

68
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:45.660
wheels of the society that kept them and their fellow landowners.

69
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.830
On top while Eagleton was looking back in time at England's press in the 17

70
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:50.970
hundreds philosopher,

71
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:55.470
Soren Kierkegaard offered harsh criticism of Copenhagen's press that emerged

72
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:57.750
during his lifetime a hundred years later.

73
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.500
But while Eagleton was critical of the European press for failing to offer a

74
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.110
truly objective perspective on current events,

75
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.580
Kierkegaard was critical of the papers and Copenhagen for being too objective.

76
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.350
One of here regards key philosophic.

77
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.050
Well tenants was that truth is subjectivity,

78
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.390
which for him meant that for anything to be true,

79
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:17.760
it had to elicit passion and commitment.

80
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.470
Now that might sound a little bit strange.

81
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:22.470
So follow with me for a bit in terms of journalism,

82
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:26.040
Kierkegaard thought that the lack of subjectivity in the press created a lack of

83
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:30.240
passion and intensity in the public and led to an age of passion lists,

84
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:33.570
reflection where people would rather observe what was happening around them.

85
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.190
Then take any active role in it.

86
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.010
One of the effects of the supposedly objective press,

87
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:41.880
according to Kierkegaard was that everyone reading the papers became one big

88
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.130
anonymous group called the public.

89
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.420
The news just became a forum of general entertainment describing the world in a

90
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:52.110
pseudo objective way. Now, if this all sounds a little bit abstract,

91
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:55.650
we can consider the work of John Stewart as the host of the daily show.

92
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.140
Jon Stewart embodied the opposite of the press.

93
00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:02.400
That Kierkegaard hated so much precisely because he operated in a mode of

94
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:05.940
subjectivity as writer, Matt Taibbi put it in the New York times,

95
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.930
some object to the characterization of Stewart as a journalist because he has

96
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:11.880
opinions and isn't objective.

97
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.640
But those people aren't to be taken seriously opinion.

98
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.440
Can't be extracted from reporting.

99
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.310
The only question is whether or not it's hidden Tybee points out that

100
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:24.480
objectivity is a guise. The press can hide behind to avoid responsibility.

101
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.390
Unlike CNN's marketing initiative to put facts.

102
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:30.750
First steward operated in a mode of pure subjectivity,

103
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.710
letting his audience know his biases upfront and breaking from the humor of his

104
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:36.510
show to get passionate about issues.

105
00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:39.720
He cared about like healthcare for nine 11 first responders.

106
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.760
It's not that facts don't exist,

107
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.710
but simply hiding behind the facts to distance yourself from your own bias is

108
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.700
well bad.

109
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.350
So if Kierkegaard pointed all this out in the 19th century and Eagleton expands

110
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.120
on it over 35 years ago,

111
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.160
why are we still so hung up on the promise of an objective of journalism?

112
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.030
The idea of objectivity in American journalism largely comes from the work of

113
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:02.870
Walter Lippmann,

114
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.320
a 20th century journalists and media critic who thought that journalists needed

115
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.080
to incorporate the scientific method into their reporting.

116
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.890
Litman thought that by presenting citizens with this more impartial news,

117
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.100
that they would be better informed and the democratic process would be

118
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:18.470
strengthened while Littmann seems to have been.

119
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.980
Well-intentioned the reason that objectivity in the news became so popular in

120
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:26.300
the 20th century, had little to do with democratic aspirations. Instead,

121
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:30.020
the real driving force behind the push toward objectivity in the American media

122
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.090
was America's most famous pastime advertising because as the press grew into a

123
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.110
full fledged industry, advertising became the largest source of media revenue.

124
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.620
<v 2>Today's news today,</v>

125
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.090
rodeos bar camel cigarettes by NBC.

126
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.560
<v 1>Having a narrow audience with a specific political slant was a business</v>

127
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:51.394
liability.

128
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.180
If a newspaper only focused on offering a socialist perspective on political

129
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:59.980
events in some mid-sized city advertisers weren't interested or worse a

130
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:03.220
paper with the opposite viewpoint might spring up and take away half of your

131
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:05.260
market share media scholar, Gerald bolt,

132
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.160
asking notes that 19th century advertisers wanted less criticism of public

133
00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:13.330
officials and reminded publishers that partisanship hurts circulation and

134
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:15.520
consequently advertising revenues.

135
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.570
Even if you had a widely read paper with a specific political leaning that

136
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:20.170
leaning,

137
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.130
might've also scared away advertisers dooming your business from the get-go as

138
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:28.300
noted by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky in their book, manufacturing consent,

139
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.200
plenty of papers throughout history were more widely read than their allegedly

140
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:33.730
more objective competitors.

141
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.360
But a lack of advertising meant they were either put out of business or bought

142
00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:40.660
by their rivals flushed with ad dollars. And once that happened,

143
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.170
their coverage began to resemble the ad friendly coverage of their parent

144
00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:44.860
company.

145
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.700
So offering an objective perspective became codeword for keeping everything

146
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.990
vanilla for the widest audience possible it's much like Kierkegaard predicted

147
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.280
that the press would turn individuals into one big anonymous public.

148
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.240
And in this case,

149
00:07:58.241 --> 00:08:02.110
the anonymous public is made up of consumers who can make money for both new

150
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:06.700
sources and their advertisers. This connection between journalism and commerce.

151
00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:10.750
Shouldn't be surprising in light of our 24 hour news cycle where people like CNN

152
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:10.961
head,

153
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:15.070
Jeff sucker have no problem acknowledging that the network is primarily offering

154
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:17.680
entertainment, even comparing it to sports.

155
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.980
Things are a little different than when manufacturing consent was written in

156
00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:25.570
1988 for one mainstream media has splintered into conservative outlets like Fox

157
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:29.740
news and liberal outlets like CNN. But the basic principles are still there.

158
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.730
Newspapers and media outlets are selling a product to advertisers and that

159
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:37.810
product is you. So while Fox news is appealing to a conservative base,

160
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.270
they want to appeal to the widest conservative base.

161
00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:44.950
They can and hopefully attract high earners among that base we'll drop money on

162
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:46.390
their advertisers products.

163
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.440
CNN similarly wants to attract a wide audience while not alienating their

164
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:53.470
well-to-do viewers who are so lucrative to their bottom line.

165
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.470
Manufacturing consent argued a series of filters defined what kinds of stories

166
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:02.640
corporate media could report on and how one of those filters was simply

167
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:06.870
corporate ownership. For instance, the head of GE, which owned NBC at the time,

168
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:10.350
told the news chief not to use the term black Monday to describe the stock

169
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:12.000
market crash of 1987,

170
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.570
as it could depress the value of GE stock broadcast a story.

171
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.380
And Eric bar now recounts how a documentary series on environmental problems was

172
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:23.310
unable to find the sponsors necessary for its production because it was critical

173
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:25.950
of corporations. And if you think much has changed,

174
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:29.370
consider the recent story that Bloomberg killed a piece about China's elite,

175
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:29.881
for fear,

176
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:33.660
they'd be shut out of the Chinese market and who could forget vice-president of

177
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:38.370
East coast, television and microwave oven programming for GE Jack Donaghy. Okay,

178
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:42.630
that one's a joke because the news media is dependent on advertising money to

179
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:43.380
make profits.

180
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.430
They directly benefit by serving the political and financial interests of the TV

181
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:50.010
networks and corporate entities that pay their bills,

182
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.770
even when covering less hot button issues.

183
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.430
If coverage of a story will alienate the board of directors or worse.

184
00:09:56.431 --> 00:10:00.330
The marketing department at Johnson and Johnson adjustments will be made.

185
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.130
And according to Herman and Chomsky,

186
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.480
much of what we are served as objective news is just propaganda for the

187
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.310
powerful.

188
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.910
<v 3>They determined that they select the shade they control.</v>

189
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:14.000
They restrict in order to serve the interests,

190
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.520
dominant elite groups in the society.

191
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.600
<v 1>It's not that journalists are bad and plenty of journalists do amazing and</v>

192
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:21.530
important work,

193
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.100
but many of them have to work through the constraints of news as business.

194
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.490
So do we just forget objectivity Brent Cunningham,

195
00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:31.460
the managing editor of the Columbia journalism review thinks that a

196
00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:35.300
reconsideration of the value of objectivity can provide a window into a

197
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.070
particular failure of the press,

198
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.150
allowing the principle of objectivity to make us passive recipients of the news

199
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.240
rather than aggressive analyzers and explainers of it.

200
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.720
While we started with the question, can the news be objective?

201
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.580
It seems like the better question might be,

202
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.240
do we actually want the news to be objective in the first place to which we'd

203
00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:57.440
likely answer? Probably not. At least not the way most people think about it,

204
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.250
whether it's at the risk of ideology being smuggled into our news or losing our

205
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:04.100
ability to critically look at information provided to us,

206
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.680
it seems like facts alone won't save us.

207
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.640
It might be better instead of feeling safe and secure with your new source of

208
00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:13.160
choice to ask whose interests are they serving?

209
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.990
How are they filtering their stories?

210
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.300
What kind of stories are not being reported?

211
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.110
Are they upfront about their own biases, but what do you guys think?

212
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.430
