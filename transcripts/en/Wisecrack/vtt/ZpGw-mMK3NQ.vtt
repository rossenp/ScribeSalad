<v 0>This video is brought to you by surf shark, VPN.</v>

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.253
<v 1>What's up why's.</v>

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.790
<v 2>Helen coming to you from a basement slash recording studio slash end of the</v>

4
00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:14.870
world bunker. Today,

5
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:18.230
we're going to chat about a film that make you swear you to never put a ring on

6
00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:20.720
it. I'm talking of course, about gone girl,

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.710
the David Fincher flick written by and based on the novel by Gillian Flynn.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.500
We love this movie, but what's most striking about it.

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.400
Besides the shapeliness of Ben Affleck's chin is it's uniquely disturbing

10
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.710
conclusions about romantic relationships.

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.570
It's no wonder that gone girl is often defined mistakenly as a film whose thesis

12
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.360
is all women are f-ing bananas.

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.590
But what if we told you that the real message is that your love life is all a

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.680
bad theatrical production, that this is inevitable,

15
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.410
and there's literally nothing you can do to stop it.

16
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.210
Hear us out in this wisecrack edition on gone. Girl love is alive.

17
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.760
And of course, spoilers ahead.

18
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.170
<v 0>Before we get into it,</v>

35
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.440
<v 2>Now a recap meet Nick and Amy done a cool New York couple who after</v>

36
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:58.850
getting laid off during the 2008 recession moved to Missouri to care for Nick's

37
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.650
ailing mother things kick off.

38
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:04.850
When Amy abruptly goes missing all suspicions immediately fall on Nick,

39
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:09.650
because that chin, as the investigation progresses,

40
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.520
things only looked worse for him. Turns out he's been cheating on Amy.

41
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:17.240
And also every clue basically screams this scumbag did it.

42
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.860
Nick insists he's innocent, but nobody not even the audience believes him.

43
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.720
That is until we get the midpoint reveal. Amy is not only alive,

44
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.830
but she plotted her entire disappearance to get back at Nick for his infidelity.

45
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.000
You almost gotta respect the hustle. But when Ann in hiding, Amy gets robbed.

46
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.350
She seeks solace in the clingy arms of her former sweetheart Desi at his creepy

47
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:41.600
Lake house. They watch Nick on live TV,

48
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.160
as he apologizes and figs Amy to come home in a last ditch attempt to avoid

49
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:50.720
murder charges turns out a successful media appearance is actually a huge

50
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.920
turn-on for our girls.

51
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.210
She responds to Nick's pleased by killing Desi and returning home covered in his

52
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:59.770
blood, claiming the Desi kidnapped and sexually her.

53
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.850
Everyone feels very sorry for Amy because she is very convincing,

54
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.190
very pretty, and again,

55
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.820
very much covered in blood except Nick knows the truth.

56
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.180
Amy is a murderer, but she's his murderer.

57
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.840
And he's in this toxic marriage for the long haul the end.

58
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.700
So here's a question.

59
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.530
Why stay with a woman who has a pathological tendency to ruin and or take the

60
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.180
lives of her romantic partners?

61
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.120
What is it that holds their bizarro love together?

62
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.540
<v 3>Two animals I've ever known.</v>

63
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.420
<v 2>The answer lies in theater, play.</v>

64
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.970
<v 3>Hot doting husband, sweet.</v>

65
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.193
<v 2>Putting spouse.</v>

66
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.550
Amy essentially lives her life as an actress playing the cool girl.

67
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.320
<v 3>Nick loved a girl. I was pretending to be cool girl.</v>

68
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.440
<v 2>Through Amy's eventual, revisionist history.</v>

69
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.730
We learned that the chill persona she put on when she and Nick first met was a

70
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.780
complete act.

71
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.010
Amy sees herself as most romantically appealing when she's pretending to be

72
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:02.850
someone she's not specifically someone who likes getting bikini waxes,

73
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.863
I wax trip,

74
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.510
essentially Nick to confesses to performing his initial cool guy self.

75
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.200
<v 3>I met a woman who dazzled on me and I wanted a lot.</v>

76
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.350
So I pretended to be better than I was.

77
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.030
<v 2>He acts confident, funny, and able to keep up with Amy's banter. Fittingly.</v>

78
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.080
Nick writes for a men's magazine. Not only is he performing to attract Amy,

79
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.630
but he's also teaching other men how to perform.

80
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.130
<v 3>Yeah. Does that make you an expert on being.</v>

81
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.640
<v 2>No man,</v>

82
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.080
appropriately Nick's wedding proposal takes the form of an uncomfortable little

83
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:38.100
show. Sure.

84
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.580
<v 3>Surprise me. Fun fact.</v>

85
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.270
You have a world-class vagina.

86
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.843
<v 2>Awkward.</v>

87
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.780
The cinematography even evokes that theatrical performance with the unfortunate

88
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:53.970
spectators framed like an audience.

89
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.470
So what we have here is two people explicitly enamored with their lovers acting

90
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.540
skills. Everyone can relate to this.

91
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.020
We've all tried to be a smarter funnier version of ourselves to impress a

92
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.890
romantic partner.

93
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.140
<v 3>You are happy in pretending to be other people.</v>

94
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.600
We were the happiest couple of winners.

95
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.320
<v 2>But are these trivial lies or something more sinister?</v>

96
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.330
The film seems to argue that particularly for women romantic expectations can

97
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:21.540
potentially be extremely deforming to the human character.

98
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.680
Amy describes the way she felt forced to contort herself into the cool girl to

99
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.340
win Nick's love and how it was both degrading and exhausting.

100
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.030
It's obviously an old cliche that when you pretend to be someone you're not,

101
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.540
you lose track of who you are. However, for Amy,

102
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:40.140
the cool girl that phenomena seems magnified. 20 fold.

103
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.230
This magnification you'll see is part of a pattern.

104
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.550
And that pattern ultimately separates Amy from the average woman who finds

105
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:49.650
interest in her boyfriend's craft beer tastes,

106
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.730
but even the most practiced romantic performers can get a rude awakening from

107
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:57.060
the real world. We see this when Nick and Amy get laid off in the great,

108
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.380
it instantly impacts their romantic performances.

109
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.930
They openly fret about who they might become.

110
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.390
<v 0>It was wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys to be</v>

111
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:11.350
trained and paraded husbands are treat their wives like the highway patrol.

112
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.300
<v 2>Then it turns out Amy's parents need to borrow back almost her entire trust fund.</v>

113
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.330
<v 0>Parents publish publisher, drop them and they're in debt up to their ears.</v>

114
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.540
That's terrible. And they need to borrow from my trust fund.

115
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.340
<v 2>Thus proving their own fairytale to be the marital equivalent of fire Fest.</v>

116
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.120
Afterward,

117
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.440
Nick basically gives up on being a husband and turns into a full-time gamer

118
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:36.970
slash shopaholic. This makes Amy occasionally act like the very not cold wife.

119
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:40.750
She dreaded becoming nagging him about money as she cleans up after him.

120
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.120
And then Nick's mom gets cancer,

121
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.200
which means the already floundering Nick and Amy show has to relocate to

122
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:50.380
Missouri. Amy feels lost out of her element. I.

123
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.390
<v 0>Feel like something he moved in by mistake.</v>

124
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.130
<v 2>You can't be a cold New York media gal when you're broken Missouri fittingly,</v>

125
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.930
the couple runs up anomic mansion in a rundown town that was hit hard in 2008,

126
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.540
leaving behind an empty neighborhood of bland homes.

127
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:08.920
Now overrun by wildlife as if to highlight the domestic ruin left in the wake of

128
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:13.060
the recession. What's more Amy struggles as a stay at home wife in the book,

129
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.240
Nick expressly tells the detectives that the couple have fought over

130
00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:17.050
housekeeping.

131
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.950
This suggests that she's failing at her role and Nick isn't doing much better.

132
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.180
He buys a depressing bar with Amy's remaining trust fund, but it's losing money.

133
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.390
Doubly undercutting his attempted performance as a competent breadwinner.

134
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.450
The point is that neither of them is really able to convince them,

135
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.920
leave performable defense.

136
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.880
So what's a guy like Nick to do when his cool guy facade is failing and his

137
00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:41.080
marriages too well. He finds a new romantic lead queue. Andy,

138
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.610
a younger cool girl who is both more impressionable and less intimidating than

139
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.530
Amy ever was. At this point.

140
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.980
Nick stops attempting even the most half-hearted performance of his marriage.

141
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.000
Instead he pulls all his energy into enjoying Andy's adoration,

142
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.530
even expressly reliving,

143
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.460
previous performative moments like when Nick wiped the snow from Andy's lifts

144
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.160
just as he wiped the sugar does from Amy's years ago.

145
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.740
It's really fitting that when carrying out as a pair,

146
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.200
Nick instinctively reverts back to cool guy,

147
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.240
the character he is most comfortable playing.

148
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.230
It comes more naturally than being himself. And that's a big old problem.

149
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.250
When Amy finds out about the affair, she's furious that he's betrayed her,

150
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:23.200
but even more so she's furious that he has successfully turned her into a cliche

151
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.200
clingy housewife or as bookie.

152
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.740
And he puts it average dumb woman married to average female, man,

153
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.740
this you see is a role she never wanted to play again.

154
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.640
It's super easy to make this all about Nick and Amy sublime dysfunction,

155
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.220
but we think the film is doing something more.

156
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.600
We think it's arguing that when someone in the early easy throws of romance

157
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.870
forces themselves into an unnatural mold, it all,

158
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.950
but dooms that relationship it's easy to perform well in the best of times.

159
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.920
But when a relationship is put under pressure, whether it's illness,

160
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.540
economic insecurity, or even a fussy new baby it's possible.

161
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.540
And even likely that said relationship might come on done,

162
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.230
but it gets worse when both participants are like Nick and Amy.

163
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.770
So completely used to performing that they've become out of touch with who they

164
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:12.420
really are in this case, losing the relationship means losing yourself. Again.

165
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.970
Many of us had been there on some level.

166
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.840
We just might not have experienced the spectacular fall that Nick and Amy do

167
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.380
still. Amy's not one to watch her marriage slowly disintegrate.

168
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.280
I'm not a quitter. Instead she goes straight scorched earth.

169
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.320
And that's when the girl goes gone.

170
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.860
Amy's disappearance under apparently violent circumstances,

171
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.210
allow her to entirely rewrite her marital history and recast the roles.

172
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.760
That's where her fate diary comes in in writing it.

173
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.450
Amy knows that the most important audience to win over is no longer Nick,

174
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.280
but rather the police and the public.

175
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.200
So she constructs a slightly massaged version of herself in her telling a

176
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:53.550
sincere loving girlfriend at becomes an innocent frightened wife who eventually

177
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.833
writes loose.

178
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.763
<v 0>Man of mine.</v>

179
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.680
<v 2>Then when constructing Nick,</v>

180
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.820
she takes her legitimate gripes that he's aloof and uncaring and dramatically

181
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:06.750
extrapolates Framingham as a scary murderous husband. Now look,

182
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.480
dude was a distant jerk who genuinely neglected her,

183
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.260
but he certainly doesn't seem to have been expressively violent or abusive.

184
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.340
Most importantly,

185
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.210
Amy's written performance draws from the very real and prevalent dynamics that

186
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.240
truly exists in a huge number of abusive relationships,

187
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.370
thus making her account more believable,

188
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.150
but perhaps the most satisfying thing for Amy after fleeing,

189
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.920
she gets to take on a new, more powerful role that of the missing golden girl,

190
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.980
the American beauty and the innocent pregnant wife.

191
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.110
This is a role that she knows will win everywhere.

192
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.790
<v 0>And America loves pregnant women.</v>

193
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.410
<v 2>And what might actually be this story's most profound indictment of our societal</v>

194
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:49.640
sexism, Amy Banks on this fact, there's no woman.

195
00:10:49.641 --> 00:10:53.270
The media loves more than a disappeared white girl. Meanwhile,

196
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.110
she has left Nick to navigate his own new role. One for which he is.

197
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.070
Ill-prepared the sad man whose wife has gone missing. Oh,

198
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.610
and also the main suspect in her disappearance flailing in his part,

199
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.000
Nick mumbles apathetically through a press conference and even gets caught

200
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.460
smiling in a picture with a flirtatious local woman.

201
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.650
Amy took a gamble and she guessed right that Nick smug, easygoing attitude.

202
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.090
And of course his chin would make him the worst possible performer of this role.

203
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.830
Revenge is sweet.

204
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.850
No wonder Amy watches from afar and utter bleak as her underperforming husband

205
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:29.390
seems to be underperforming himself right into the state penitentiary.

206
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.460
But why not just leave him and or egg his car? Why the whole elaborate plot,

207
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.090
it's actually pretty fitting that Amy is unable to simply disappear and leave it

208
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:38.630
at that.

209
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.280
Instead the ever able actor needs to entirely rewrite her marriage and recast

210
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:44.210
the roles to her liking.

211
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.230
We'd argue that this is particularly easy for Amy who seems to have lost sight

212
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:51.800
of who she is from years of pretending to be the cool girl inventing and

213
00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:55.450
performing comes weirdly to her. Again, this sounds crazy,

214
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.140
but it isn't that different from something a lot of us have done to varying

215
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:03.880
degrees that is recasting a relationship after it fails painting a

216
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:07.120
self-preserving narrative that allows us to cope with the reality.

217
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:09.670
We can't accept once again in the film,

218
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.630
somewhat banal and universal behavior that happens in a lot of semi

219
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:17.740
dysfunctional relationships gets dialed up until it becomes terrifying and

220
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.760
unrecognizable. But of course, because this is Nick and Amy done,

221
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.780
things are only going to get more demented. Nick finds a veritable bachelors,

222
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:28.990
then his sister's woodshed, and finally connects the dots.

223
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.460
Amy set him up truly petrified. Nick seeks the help of Tanner bolt,

224
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.900
a professional skeeze ball.

225
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:39.400
Lawyer bolt helps Nick shift the narrative specifically by directing his act.

226
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.350
He literally trains Nick to one stop seeming like a smug Dick and to

227
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.480
paint himself to also be a victim.

228
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.490
And so Nick goes on TV and becomes the best possible sad husband whose wife has

229
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:55.090
gone missing. He lies to the world about profoundly missing, loving,

230
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:59.140
and fearing for Amy and admits to being a lousy partner. And honestly,

231
00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:00.160
he kind of kills it.

232
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.570
<v 3>I don't care about that anymore. I just want to find my wife.</v>

233
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.180
<v 2>This is a performance for which Amy was unprepared.</v>

234
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.170
It's exactly this moment that we see Amy's demeanor change. Suddenly.

235
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.350
She seems attracted to Nick. He's outperforming her for once.

236
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.850
And it only took hours of intricate coaching once again. And we hate to say it,

237
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.440
plenty of us know the feeling of performing a perfect sell for our ex in hopes

238
00:13:22.441 --> 00:13:25.050
of winning them back, manifesting everything.

239
00:13:25.051 --> 00:13:28.740
They wanted us to be this kind of performance isn't necessarily rational.

240
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.360
And it definitely isn't particularly healthy, but it's understandable. However,

241
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.130
if you're Nick and you married, Amy,

242
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.370
your performance is also a fight for your life.

243
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.080
So like higher stakes that said for most of us, such a performance,

244
00:13:43.081 --> 00:13:45.510
usually doesn't work out long-term for Nick.

245
00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:49.710
It only seems to persuade Amy because she has so long been desperate for him to

246
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:50.760
perform to her liking.

247
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.350
And so Amy gets into character for her performance of crime, number two,

248
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.880
promptly, seducing and killing Desi. And then she finally comes home.

249
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.900
And this moment,

250
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.130
Nick and Amy perform a perfect reunion for the press complete with a perfectly

251
00:14:05.131 --> 00:14:09.300
dramatic embrace, which ends with Amy appearing to faint America's beloved,

252
00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:13.920
missing woman and sad husband instantly become America's golden couple of course

253
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.720
there's trouble in this FDIC paradise as they embrace Nick whispers.

254
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.143
<v 3>Okay.</v>

255
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.200
<v 2>It's the first time we've seen him call Amy out and performing or vice versa.</v>

256
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.160
Of course only he knows the insane and murderous steps of her depravity.

257
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.910
Then Nick gets to watch his wife play brave survivor in the hospital.

258
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.710
Unlike average dumb woman married to average He-Man this is a role she's chosen

259
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.960
and she milks it for all it's worth.

260
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.890
What's more her flawless performance ensures she won't be tried for her crime

261
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.700
despite detective bony skepticism. Why did you try to buy a gun?

262
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.290
Understandably wary of his killer wife. Nick is not exactly to,

263
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.453
except for new act.

264
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.430
He's even less stoked to commit to the chagrin toning husband.

265
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:56.360
He performed so well.

266
00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.740
<v 0>And that guy saw on TV. That's the fell in love with. You do know,</v>

267
00:14:59.741 --> 00:15:01.450
I was just telling you what you wanted to hear.

268
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.180
<v 2>He threatens to leave her multiple times,</v>

269
00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.850
but Amy sets him straight on just how dumb that would be.

270
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.760
<v 0>The way back to her desserts. They'll destroy.</v>

271
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:15.250
Still.

272
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.950
<v 2>Nick insists that once the media attention fades,</v>

273
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.240
he's going to write himself off the Nick and Amy show at the subsequent welcome

274
00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:26.800
home. Amy PR stunt, Nick stands beautifully by, as Amy delivers for the crowd,

275
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.990
adding to the show only when she demands it.

276
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.210
And with the most minimal amount of conviction.

277
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:39.310
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

278
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.310
<v 2>He begs his lawyer and the detective to help improve the truth,</v>

279
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.270
but both decline he's on his own importantly,

280
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.940
in order for the new Nick and Amy Love's story to work,

281
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:53.050
they necessarily must corroborate all the awful things Amy wrote about Nick.

282
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.810
<v 0>I'm going to need those three things to feel safe.</v>

283
00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:58.600
You have to own it.

284
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.890
<v 2>Amy candidly demands. He play the humbled husband indefinitely,</v>

285
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.000
but the ambiguous line between performance and reality is about to really

286
00:16:07.001 --> 00:16:10.450
disappear near the end. Amy tells Nick that she's pregnant.

287
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.010
The mic hasn't touched her.

288
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.090
Apparently she's commandeered some old blue sample in this way.

289
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.310
She's turned her unhappy life,

290
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.850
field marriage into a real tangible family.

291
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.560
Curious Nick insists that he still going to leave and gets violent.

292
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:31.330
The idea of performing happy Parenthood with a murderer is it seems too much for

293
00:16:31.331 --> 00:16:34.600
him to take that's. When Amy delivers these blistery words.

294
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.320
<v 0>The only time you liked yourself was when you were trying to be someone.</v>

295
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.090
<v 2>In this moment, they show each other, their genuine humanity,</v>

296
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.530
his abusive rage and her manipulative psychopathy. Afterwards,

297
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.360
Nick tries to reason with her.

298
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.530
<v 0>All we did was respect each other and try to control each other and caused each</v>

299
00:16:53.531 --> 00:16:54.364
other pain.

300
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.380
<v 2>She merely affirms that's marriage in front of the TV crew.</v>

301
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.120
Nick takes Amy's hand and seems to concede to her demands that their marriage is

302
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:06.460
an ugly performance. He must partake in,

303
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.100
even if he doesn't fully like the roles been given,

304
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:13.480
he will have to embody this persona, but he'll get to do so. At Amy side,

305
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.120
they're agreeing to collude in deceiving the world.

306
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.420
We see as much when Nick explained his logic to his sister, Margo,

307
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.730
he says he needs to stay around for the baby,

308
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.740
but Marco sees something more sinister.

309
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.930
<v 0>You want to stay? I have a responsibility. It's not about what I want anymore.</v>

310
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:30.933
You want to stay here.

311
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.010
<v 2>He can't even deny it.</v>

312
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.650
He and Amy have finally found a performance that each can,

313
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.200
except Nick shines in the TV interview,

314
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.600
delivering the perfect act on Amy's behalf.

315
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.570
<v 0>We're going to be parents.</v>

316
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.500
<v 2>Todd hall, their marriage is saved. So, uh,</v>

317
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.670
what the there's so creepy and fitting about.

318
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.590
Amy's ultimate revenge against Nick.

319
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.490
It's perfectly corollary to the way she felt forced to perform cool girl.

320
00:17:56.491 --> 00:18:00.930
When they first stated she has masterfully manipulated the situation to force

321
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.460
Nick to forever perform as someone that he's not both with her and with the

322
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:09.810
world they have through their love each molded and change one another.

323
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.770
And we're left to presume not for the better as Nick reflects in both the

324
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.570
opening and the conclusion of the film.

325
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.690
Marriage has forced each of them to become someone else.

326
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.600
<v 1>We'd done to each other. What will we do.</v>

327
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.030
<v 2>Now? As we said earlier,</v>

328
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.480
many people leave this movie with though women be crazy shrub,

329
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.940
but that's a pretty facile interpretation.

330
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.690
Rather we'd argue that this movie is saying something about all of us,

331
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.930
about how we lie and perform and relationships.

332
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.860
I have how those performances to form our very being similarly,

333
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.240
many of us recast ourselves as victims as Amy does and perform ourselves to

334
00:18:47.241 --> 00:18:51.380
perfection in the fallout of a relationship as Nick does. But there's more,

335
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.510
the movie seems to posit a few larger,

336
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.570
ultimately dark things about marriage and romantic love in general.

337
00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.290
First that happy relationships are ultimately performances in which the

338
00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:04.520
participants tacitly agreed to put on a good show for the world and often or

339
00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:06.920
each other. It's obviously true of Nick and Amy.

340
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.230
And in some ways it's true for a lot of us.

341
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.250
Nick and Amy with their TV appearance are merely the most extreme conceivable

342
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.120
version of your average couple putting on a happy face for a party after having

343
00:19:17.121 --> 00:19:19.550
a huge fight. That's why it's so creepy.

344
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.020
It takes existing relationship dynamics and just crank them up to 11. Second.

345
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.310
It pauses that romantic relationships are often for the participants themselves,

346
00:19:28.311 --> 00:19:32.540
bonds of questionable genuineness, a dance between honesty and the seat.

347
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.140
It argues that we can never truly know if the person we're with is being

348
00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:38.630
themselves or if they're merely playing a role.

349
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.890
And that maybe we don't even want to know no matter how close we are.

350
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.370
We can't fully understand the nature of our partner, subjectivity,

351
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.840
what they're thinking, what they're feeling or what they have in store for us.

352
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.680
What's more,

353
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.510
it seems to argue that we kind of enjoy the performance and if not too

354
00:19:56.511 --> 00:19:59.780
bad, because there is literally no other way.

355
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.220
And that twice crack is why I have resigned myself to living out my golden

356
00:20:04.221 --> 00:20:08.330
years, surrounded by cats. Kidding, sort of,

357
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.250
but what do you guys think is romantic love inherently deforming to the human

358
00:20:13.251 --> 00:20:17.840
character? Or am I just projecting? Let us know what you think in the comments.

359
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.200
