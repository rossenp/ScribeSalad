00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>This video is brought to you by Wondershare Filmora 10</v>

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.770
What's up wisecrack Michael here,

3
00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:13.280
and I'm back in a heavily sanitized wisecrack studio.

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.730
Please people wear your freaking mask. Anyway,

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.750
today I've got Disney on my brain and not just because my installed sick mom

6
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:22.130
keeps sending me this photo.

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.890
<v 2>And who can blame me.</v>

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.540
They basically own or license everything I love and everything I

9
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:30.290
hate.

10
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.010
And that's not to mention the new season of the Mandalorian because they own

11
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:36.530
star Wars also X-Men that's right.

12
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.210
They own the X people and just take a Gander at the top grossing films last

13
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:45.830
year, and you'll be greeted by one name and one name only see from end game to a

14
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:47.660
Latin, from frozen to, to toy story.

15
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.770
Four Disney made seven of the top 10 highest grossing films of 2019.

16
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.590
And while this feat is impressive, even for the big mouse,

17
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.470
it's not exactly something new. In fact,

18
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:02.090
many of the top 50 highest grossing films of all time were either made by or

19
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:06.110
later bought by Disney. Now maybe for some of you, this doesn't matter.

20
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:08.390
As long as you get that Marvel, cinematic, goodness,

21
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:12.530
injected into your eyeballs a few times a year, and I totally get it.

22
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.880
But what if I told you that Disney's ever broadening artistic reach is actually

23
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:20.960
bad for culture and not just because they made the worst star war,

24
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.550
how let's find out in this wisecrack edition on how Disney ruined culture.

25
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.410
And I guess spoilers ahead for films,

26
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:29.600
you absolutely saw if you were ever a child.

27
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
<v 0>But before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor.</v>

28
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:36.710
Wondershare Filmora, we've all been picking up new hobbies since early March.

29
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:38.540
And if you're thinking about starting your own channel,

30
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:40.790
then you should check it out. Wonder sheriff will.

31
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.160
Maura is a simple to use video at Aiden program,

32
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:45.890
which is comparable and more affordable than other big brands.

33
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:47.570
You might know Gamora.

34
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.080
Isn't just for simple edits either since it includes advanced features like

35
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:51.914
Chrome McKean,

36
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.160
video stabilization and speed duration clipping here at wisecrack.

37
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.911
Until recently,

38
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:59.150
we haven't been able to shoot in our regular studio with fancy cameras in

39
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.790
lights, but editing with Wondershare Filmora.

40
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.740
We could combat some of our issues.

41
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.880
The new update includes some awesome key features like color match, key framing,

42
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:09.440
motion tracking, and audio ducking.

43
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.110
So you can create a professional looking video.

44
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.200
The best part is that the interface is user-friendly.

45
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.740
So you don't have to worry about spending too much time. Googling tutorials,

So let us know what you would create in Filmora.

50
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.340
Now back to the show in the past few decades,

51
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:35.630
Disney has gone from an industry giant to an absolute behemoth acquire.

52
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.300
<v 2>I mean everything from the Muppets to Pixar, to Marvel,</v>

53
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:41.690
to star Wars to most recently 21st century Fox,

54
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.270
of course Disney's game of hungry, hungry hippos,

55
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:47.510
but for intellectual property goes way back to the beginning.

56
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.670
According to the company's own telling founder,

57
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:53.120
Walt Disney moved to Los Angeles almost 800 years ago with,

58
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:57.980
and I quote a lot of hopes, but little ELLs, how wholesome four years later,

59
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:01.510
Disney got his first taste of success with Oswald. The lucky rabbit.

60
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.170
You only catch when Disney tried to make a, another round of these cartoons.

61
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:08.770
He found out that it distributor had gone behind his back and poached all of his

62
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.010
animators, worse upon reading the fine print of his contract.

63
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.900
Disney realized he didn't even own the rights to Oswald his distributor did.

64
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.770
And thus like a super villains origin story are Intrepid young waltz vows to

65
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:23.800
never get screened again. Or as disney.com puts it.

66
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.060
He saw to it that he owned everything that he made after that Disney set up shop

67
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.990
in a studio that is five minutes away from wisecrack headquarters and is now a

68
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.060
high-end grocery store here.

69
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:38.710
He created his most iconic character from then on Disney became a veritable

70
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.470
creative and financial powerhouse by 1937,

71
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.800
it would break all box office records with the release of snow white and the

72
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:49.240
seven dwarves early on though, the success was predicated on a simple formula,

73
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.710
find an existing story,

74
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.640
make it as cute and wholesome as possible to maximize your potential audience

75
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.210
and then dive into your Scrooge McDuck sized money pool.

76
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.460
Of course you might think this is fine.

77
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.570
After all pop culture is by definition entertainment aimed at the largest

78
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:09.130
possible audience. And Disney definitely had one thing and aesthetic,

79
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.910
you know, round faces, saucer eyes, big goofy grins.

80
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.020
And if the kids love it, how could it be bad? But as we've mentioned before,

81
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:20.770
Disney's reign of cuteness was not a happy accident or mere coincidence.

82
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.550
Walt was basically ruthless in his quest to make all things adorable.

83
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.390
And in the process, Disney has spent the last 100 years acquiring stories,

84
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:32.740
adapting them and ultimately twisting their original artistic intentions beyond

85
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:33.550
recognition.

86
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.990
All of which is to say is all this cuteness actually super unqoute,

87
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.250
but to see the Disney method in action, let's dissect an early example,

88
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.270
Pinocchio for the uninitiated. This story revolves around the titular puppet,

89
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:50.290
who just wants to be a real boy as the magical blue fairytales.

90
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.190
And his wish will be granted. If he proves to be brave, truthful and unselfish.

91
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.620
<v 3>Someday, you will be a real boy.</v>

92
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.440
<v 2>But Pinocchio's not about that life. He runs away from home,</v>

93
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:04.170
joins a puppet show and the lies to the blue fairy about it,

94
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.390
which famously leads to this.

95
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.210
The ferry lets them off the hook,

96
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.550
but Pinocchio doesn't stay out of trouble for long.

97
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.510
He soon whisked away on an all-expense trip to the dubiously named pleasure

98
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.760
Island. There Pinocchio in his resort.

99
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.670
Buddies engage in all sorts of vices from drinking to smoking,

100
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:24.570
to gambling only to find out that they're turning into donkeys,

101
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.270
but with the help of his cricket companion, Pinocchio,

102
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:32.100
narrowly escapes only to learn that his daddy got lost at sea looking for him.

103
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.440
<v 3>It says here, he, uh, he went looking for you and, uh,</v>

104
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.600
he was swallowed by a whale.

105
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.501
<v 2>Pinocchio,</v>

106
00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:41.820
then sacrifices his little wooden life to save the old man from the literal

107
00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:45.810
belly of the whale. But lo and behold, now the Pinocchio is good.

108
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:48.120
He's brought back to life by the blue fairy,

109
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.310
but this time as a real boy and everyone lives happily ever after if

110
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.310
only life was that easy. But what if I told you that the author of Pinocchio.

111
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 0>Carlo, Colatti never intended for his story to give children that warm,</v>

112
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:06.080
fuzzy feeling and that once Disney had bought the rights to the story,

113
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.070
the company whitewash Pinocchio to fit the big mouse cutesy aesthetic.

114
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.240
If you have any doubt,

115
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.450
then I present to you the original ending of collodion Pinocchio.

116
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.470
Without loss of time, they tied his arms, pastor running new,

117
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:22.910
surround his throat and hung him to the branch of a tree called the big Oak.

118
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.220
A tempestuous northerly wind began to blow and roar angrily and

119
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.920
it beat the puppet from side to side,

120
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.060
making him swing violently like the clatter of a bell ringing for a wedding.

121
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.450
And the swinging gave him atrocious spasms, really bad. His breath failed.

122
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.050
And he could say no more shut his eyes opened his mouth,

123
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.570
stretched his legs and gave a long shutter and hung stiff and

124
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:54.710
insensible. You heard right?

125
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.620
Colotti had Pinocchio, gruesomely, hanged.

126
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.220
This inspired so much angry fan mail that his editor demanded.

127
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.180
He bring the puppet back to life and continue the series which he begrudgingly

128
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:07.220
did in Colonia. His defense though,

129
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.360
Pinocchio being hanged was pretty much par for the course. It's hard to say.

130
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.680
<v 2>And Disney's version, but Pinocchio. It was intended to be a tongue in cheek,</v>

131
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.690
albeit bleak morality, tale,

132
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.530
the simple moral be good or suffered throughout the story.

133
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:23.020
We see a mean-spirited and rude Pinocchio,

134
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.520
a stand in for all misbehaving children robbed starved stand,

135
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.880
and also his legs get sought off, but we're not supposed to feel,

136
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:35.050
especially sorry for him, his actions cause all of his suffering. Oh,

137
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:38.890
and if that wasn't enough, Colotti also heaped on the psychological abuse,

138
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.360
making Pinocchio at one point, think he had killed Japan and the blue fairy,

139
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.910
which I didn't even know as possible.

140
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.140
And while you and I growing up in a media diet full of high saturated Disney

141
00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:53.620
cuteness might find this story. Repulsive, it's pretty run of the mill.

142
00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:56.530
If you're familiar with old German folklore more recently,

143
00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:59.320
we've seen similarly Gothic tones and children's books like lemony.

144
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.560
Snicket's a series of unfortunate events. Now let's be fair.

145
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.700
And maybe you don't want your kids' bedtime story ending Incruse and death,

146
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.780
but there's still something unsettling about the way a media giant like Disney

147
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:14.770
can take a beloved fairy tale purge it of its original intentions and thus

148
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:17.290
rewrite the narrative and our collective memories.

149
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.290
Instead of saying faithful to colonias artistic intention,

150
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.930
Disney did what it would continue to do for decades.

151
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.490
Bias story Belichick in a caustic VAT of cuteness and pump it out in exchange

152
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.353
for cold,

153
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:33.130
hard cash gone where the dark satiric overtones and in their place were syrupy

154
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:34.210
lines like this.

155
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.930
<v 4>He deserved to be a real goer.</v>

156
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.550
<v 2>Pinocchio himself.</v>

157
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.760
He went from being a total frat bro to the naive piece of pine.

158
00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:45.130
We know and love today in the process,

159
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.000
his character design underwent similar changes with Walt Disney scrapping the

160
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.110
angular designs found in Colone story for a character model that can best be

161
00:08:53.111 --> 00:08:56.820
described as what would happen. If Mickey had a baby with a tree,

162
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.740
obviously colonias estate was kind of with his grandson suing Disney's Italian

163
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.160
distributor for infringing on the moral copyright of the story.

164
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.100
Now I know what you're thinking. It's an adaptation.

165
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.480
Artists are allowed to adapt and sure they are plenty of great art exists

166
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:15.480
because someone took an existing story and made it their own.

167
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.540
Sometimes undercutting the original like pride and prejudice,

168
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.610
but at zombies more seriously,

169
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.000
something like there will be blood took the first few pages of Upton.

170
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:28.830
Sinclair's equally awesome book oil and basically threw away everything else,

171
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.460
but nobody would accuse Paul Thomas Anderson of whitewashing oil.

172
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:36.180
And I don't think pride and prejudice and zombies has somehow cheap into the

173
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:37.260
Jane Austen novel.

174
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.310
Maybe part of the difference lies in formula and scale PTA.

175
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:45.240
Hasn't created a billion dollar industry by stripping stories of their content

176
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:47.730
and replacing them with a deranged Daniel Day Lewis.

177
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.710
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

178
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.711
<v 2>Disney.</v>

179
00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:55.520
On the other hand regularly take stories like Pinocchio or sleeping beauty or

180
00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:59.480
hell the hunchback of Notre dam and throws them into the commercial meat

181
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:00.530
grinder. Worse.

182
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.400
They'd been doing this pretty consistently for the past hundred years.

183
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.880
Seriously. If you were to put all the Disney films on a spinning wheel,

184
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.290
whatever you land on would likely be an adaptation in which the original story

185
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:15.770
has been blanched artistically ground down and pumped out as a cute little

186
00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:20.520
Disney sausage. Actually, why don't we just spin that wheel and find out I,

187
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.280
yes, the 1989 classic the little mermaid timeless story in which a young mermaid

188
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:28.940
makes a frosty and bargain with a sea witch to gain legs so she can win the hand

189
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.750
of a hunky brands based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale of the same name,

190
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.490
Disney's retelling strips.

191
00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:37.820
The story of a lot of its darker and more religious overtones.

192
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.150
And the big mouses version were treated to a love story that ends with they

193
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:45.290
happily ever after the Prince ultimately realizes that he really digs this

194
00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:48.200
mermaid. The mermaid frees herself from the sea witch's curse.

195
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.940
The Prince harpoons said, see which end all is basically right with the world.

196
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.880
The message true love saves all,

197
00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.140
but the source material isn't nearly as happy or uplifting that's because

198
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:03.470
Anderson flatly rejected this message. First of all,

199
00:11:03.471 --> 00:11:08.270
his story portrays love primarily as suffering. For example, Anderson's mermaid.

200
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.880
Doesn't just give away her voice and exchange for legs,

201
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.710
but also indoors the pain of being stabbed every time she takes a step,

202
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.460
nevertheless, she delights in dancing for the Prince and making him happy.

203
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.090
What's more in Anderson's telling the Prince never returns the mermaid's

204
00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:27.200
affection. Instead he marries a local princess. So yeah,

205
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.243
rough deal.

206
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.240
But there's a reason for this Anderson wanted the mermaid to be saved,

207
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.040
not by love, but by sacrifice at the start of the story, the mermaid despairs,

208
00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:38.660
not just because she's half fish,

209
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.620
but also because she doesn't have a soul and won't be able to chill with her

210
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.060
Prince in heaven. In fact,

211
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.780
the whole bargain with the which revolves around Ariel gaining a soul.

212
00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:52.160
If she manages to kiss her true love. But as Anderson explained to a friend,

213
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.290
he never wanted the mermaid to gain a soul simply because she fell in love with

214
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.280
a straight up hunk. He thought such an ending would be explicitly wrong.

215
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.110
In short Anderson would have despised Disney's ending in which a kiss and a

216
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:08.950
strategic boat crash saves the day. See in Anderson's tale,

217
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.970
the mermaid saves the day with a Christ-like sacrifice where she gives up her

218
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:16.440
life and love to save the Prince. And lo and behold,

219
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.260
she's rewarded for her good deeds and turned into a gentle spirit.

220
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.970
If she helps mankind for the next 300 years, she'll be rewarded with the soul.

221
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.970
Her a well, according to Anderson,

222
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.150
this is the more natural more divine path though.

223
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:34.750
It probably wouldn't have jacked up Disney's 1989 stock prices.

224
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.720
And at this point we could keep rambling off examples.

225
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.190
The real Pocahontas is not a story about the freedom to love, who you choose.

226
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.810
It's about colonists kidnapping,

227
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.360
a native American woman and murdering her husband.

228
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.260
The original sleeping beauty is literally about a woman being non consensually

229
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:52.870
impregnated in her sleep and giving birth to twins.

230
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.120
<v 0>Also in her sleep.</v>

231
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.420
Now we're not going to say Disney should be making more films about assault

232
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.710
because that'd be horrible. However, the general Disney meat grinder,

233
00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:05.760
which polishes off any roughened and savory edges comes with consequences.

234
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.140
<v 2>In the case of Pocahontas,</v>

235
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.010
it's a very easy history lesson that some people might never question,

236
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:15.210
but that's just the first of many ways that Disney's storytelling might actually

237
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:18.210
be a major disservice for developing young minds.

238
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.810
And that's because most of the stories Disney adapts are fairytales.

239
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.130
And while these stories may often be dark and complex and vaguely disturbing,

240
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.450
they also offer children a symbolic template for understanding the world,

241
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.730
for example, and at children's cancer clinic,

242
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.540
researchers found that patients were able to use fairytales to express and cope

243
00:13:36.541 --> 00:13:40.680
with their anxieties. One child, for example, identified with the big,

244
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.450
bad Wolf in little red riding hood,

245
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.340
venting his frustration and anger by drawing an oversized Wolf with massive

246
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.000
teeth.

247
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.140
Another child drew a comically tiny Wolf as an expression of confidence and

248
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:54.420
bravery in the face of his struggles here,

249
00:13:54.421 --> 00:13:58.500
we see how the darkness of fairytales can actually offer a light to children

250
00:13:58.501 --> 00:13:59.730
confronting adversity,

251
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.990
but Disney often strips these fairytales of their bites instead inserting a

252
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.520
bland, wholesome narrative,

253
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.750
as we saw with Pinocchio and the little mermaid and ironically in the process,

254
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.990
Disney's developed new narratives that are in their own rights,

255
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.510
potentially quite destructive as psychologist,

256
00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:19.200
Susan darker Smith points out young girls who identify with characters like

257
00:14:19.201 --> 00:14:22.980
Cinderella or Belle from beauty and the beast are more likely to end up in

258
00:14:22.981 --> 00:14:27.060
abusive relationships as adults, while interviewing victims of domestic abuse,

259
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.660
darker Smith found that many identified with the heroines of these stories in

260
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:34.590
which love conquers all believing that if their love is strong enough,

261
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:36.600
they can change their partner's behavior.

262
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.200
<v 0>Of course, the reality is tragically different ironically,</v>

263
00:14:40.201 --> 00:14:43.650
by pedaling a convenient narrative in which all the world's problems can be

264
00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:45.060
solved by true love.

265
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.050
Disney fails to give children any tools for navigating real life problems.

266
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.550
And that was kind of the whole point of fairytales to convey the darker and

267
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:53.870
crueler aspects of life.

268
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:57.560
So as to better prepare children for the realities of adulthood, of course,

269
00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.640
this all begs.

270
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.740
<v 2>The question should Disney care,</v>

271
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.060
according to the legendary and incendiary free market economist,

272
00:15:04.061 --> 00:15:06.790
Milton Friedman, definitely not.

273
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.630
He argued that companies don't have the same responsibilities that people do.

274
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:15.520
A person might have a responsibility to be a nice neighbor or recycle while a

275
00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:19.120
company's only responsibility is to make more money.

276
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.140
And Friedman's definition of corporate responsibility has pretty much become

277
00:15:23.141 --> 00:15:24.700
gospel. In other words,

278
00:15:24.701 --> 00:15:28.630
Disney will only do what is required to make the most amount of money,

279
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.850
regardless of the social consequences.

280
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.420
It's the capitalist raise on debt of companies, the world over,

281
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.390
and it explains why Disney operates acuteness factory.

282
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.690
<v 0>Indeed when Disney went dark in the 1970s and eighties,</v>

283
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.270
it put out a series of grimmer, edgier films,

284
00:15:43.271 --> 00:15:46.540
like the black cauldron that were huge box office failures,

285
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.470
and nearly brought about the collapse of the great empire.

286
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.980
<v 2>The so-called Disney Renaissance of the nineties was a major course correction</v>

287
00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:57.790
back into the sentimental cuteness that has sustained the company ever since.

288
00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.410
And it's no wonder cuteness after all has a very particular way of

289
00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:05.170
hijacking or brains. And more importantly,

290
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.190
itself studies have shown the cuteness increases our concentration,

291
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.300
a useful trick to make sure humans pay close attention to their adorable young

292
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.600
or, you know, pay more attention to a dysfunctional snowman.

293
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.710
<v 0>Even more telling when volunteers were hooked up to an MRI machine and bombarded</v>

294
00:16:20.711 --> 00:16:21.880
with cute images there,

295
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:25.840
nucleus accumbens also known as the pleasure center of the brain lit up and

296
00:16:25.841 --> 00:16:27.490
started pumping out dopamine.

297
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.630
<v 2>In other words, when viewers saw Mickey mouse's adorable body Bob,</v>

298
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.730
up and down on screen, 100 years ago,

299
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.170
they were unwittingly receiving the first micro doses of Disney branded brain

300
00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:39.760
candy. Interestingly enough,

301
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.020
the phenomenon of cuteness being used for potentially nefarious purposes has a

302
00:16:44.021 --> 00:16:47.560
name, cultural theorist, Joshua Paul Dale calls it evil.

303
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.850
And while Dale specifically sites gambling machines that use cute cartoon

304
00:16:51.851 --> 00:16:52.900
kittens. As an example,

305
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.920
it's not hard to argue that Disney's precious animated friends might also

306
00:16:56.921 --> 00:17:01.750
qualify in the end. Cuteness is just a means for Disney to Pat its bottom line,

307
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.620
regardless of it's telling stories that are ultimately good for children.

308
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.520
And while you might not be too devastated to hear the Disney sabotage your

309
00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:12.640
favorite 16th century tale about a naughty century and puppet.

310
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.000
<v 0>Disney vacation of storytelling becomes more viscerally upsetting.</v>

311
00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:19.210
When the big mouse starts screwing around with more iconic.

312
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.043
<v 2>Cultural works,</v>

313
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.100
you catch my drift ever since Disney acquired the universe's most beloved

314
00:17:24.101 --> 00:17:28.690
franchise fans have increasingly despaired at the creative choices that resulted

315
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.560
the last trilogy began with sentimental fan service, befitting of Disney.

316
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.070
It seemed to briefly flirt with darkness and complexity in the last Jedi

317
00:17:36.071 --> 00:17:39.490
suggesting star Wars wouldn't fall completely into the pits of cuteness.

318
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.390
And then this that's right,

319
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.170
Disney quickly course corrected and opted for a sweet conclusion based on a

320
00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:49.710
magical kiss, romantic sacrifice. And of course,

321
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.110
everyone you care about is Jedi royalty.

322
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:57.060
Now all of which is to say there's no property or franchise,

323
00:17:57.061 --> 00:18:00.270
which Disney won't find a way to Rapids cute little tentacles around.

324
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.910
So what happens now? Honestly,

325
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.120
probably nothing good as Disney continues to grow,

326
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:08.100
which it's almost certainly going to do.

327
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.490
It's reasonable to worry that we'll see an expansion of their blanket philosophy

328
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:13.680
of cuteness. And as we've seen in the past,

329
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.940
that cuteness probably comes at the expense of story nuance and morality.

330
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.570
It definitely makes us nervous for the future of a franchise. Like X-Men,

331
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.470
it's hard to imagine Disney signing off on something that's adversive as Logan

332
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.640
and as Disney continues to gobble up more and more of the media we'd love.

333
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:34.560
We're worried that there won't be space for grittier darker stories for grown-up

334
00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:35.880
fairytales, if you will.

335
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.660
But what do you guys think is our loading for the Disney empire totally

336
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:43.590
reasonable and warranted? Or do we sound like overly quarantined haters?

337
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.380
Let us know in the comments is always huge.

Like it's a fairytale you're ready to ruin four buckets of money. And as always,

340
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.573
thanks for watching.
