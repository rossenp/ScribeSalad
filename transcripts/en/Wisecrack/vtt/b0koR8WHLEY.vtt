<v 0>This video is brought to you by keeps.</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.870
<v 1>What's up guys, Greg Michael,</v>

3
00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:12.350
here time-traveling movies has a weird history to say the least,

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.530
whether it's a DeLorean juiced up to 1.2, one gigawatts,

5
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:17.930
a germ filled hot tub or Keanu Reeves.

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.580
It's basically always a certifiable mind trip.

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.210
And yet we keep returning to these stories because they tickle our brains with

8
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:27.860
one very compelling question.

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.850
Do we have any free will to change the future or are the awful things that

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.320
happened to us? Inevitable.

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.790
Enter dark this German Netflix series centers around a small forest town whose

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.680
residence time traveled across centuries,

13
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.600
trying to change a tragic chain of events,

14
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.180
their ultimate goal avoid an off disgust.

15
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.350
<v 0>Phillips. [inaudible].</v>

16
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.450
<v 1>The question of whether or not they can do anything about their impending doom</v>

17
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:56.720
is the core of the show's mystery and make no mistake.

18
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.270
This show we'll have you up at 3:00 AM,

19
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.830
a hundred comments deep on a Reddit thread about dark's incestuous family tree.

20
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.940
But more on that later, they're really important question to pose is, is this,

21
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.060
do we have the power to prevent our own suffering?

22
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.290
And is it even worth trying to let's find out in this wisecrack edition on the

23
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:20.090
philosophy of dark and as always spoilers ahead. But before we continue,

24
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:23.750
I want to give a shout out to this week. Sponsor keeps I love wearing hats.

25
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.700

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.190
Now back to the show. And now a quick recap, dark tells the story of winded,

43
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.850
rural town face in a series of tragic, but seemingly normal events.

44
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.130
This all quickly spirals into time, travel,

45
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:29.900
accidental incest and interdimensional disaster. So first a guy kills himself.

46
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.830
Then a boy goes missing. And then the son of the guy who killed himself,

47
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.760
Jonas starts looking for the missing boy via a literal wormhole to the past.

48
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.181
There,

49
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:41.660
he learns that the missing boy has been living in 1986 and will grow up to

50
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.640
become his dad. Oh, and meanwhile,

51
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.060
a whole lot of other folks are also secretly messing with time travel to

52
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.470
eventually the people have wind in from as far back as 1888 to as far forward as

53
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:56.150
2053, discover that they are trapped in a perpetual unchangeable time loop.

54
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.760
That always ends in a horrible apocalypse. Oh yeah.

55
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.650
And finds out that his crushed Martha is in fact his aunt. Yikes.

56
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.900
So let's take this one season at a time.

57
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.980
All our characters are using time-travel to try to fix or change the future,

58
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.060
but do they even have that power or are they cursed to stay trapped in this

59
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:13.601
rainy,

60
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.500
suburban hell of a time loop midway through the season Jonas and the people of

61
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:21.400
wind and discover the wormhole beneath her town and attempt to correct or change

62
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.330
the central event.

63
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.770
The young boys disappearance at first Jonas thinks he has free will and that his

64
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.680
choices will determine his fate and the fate of the missing boy.

65
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.610
But a mysterious stranger tells him that taking the boy back to 2019 would

66
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:37.870
result in the end of Jonas's own existence because this kid is his father and

67
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.210
needs to grow up in the past in order to, you know,

68
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.590
father Jonas examples like this are numerous and the results are always the

69
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.200
same. Every time someone tries to change the past,

70
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.770
they're actually just doing something that by necessity has already happened.

71
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.280
And as the characters attempts to change the past are continuously forwarded.

72
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.120
They slowly realized that they don't have free will rather they seem to be

73
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:01.060
trapped in an endless cycle. That's outside their control.

74
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.120
We can understand this endless cycle with a little help from Arthur

75
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.140
Schopenhauer, who side note was a horrible hand. According to Schopenhauer,

76
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.780
the world is driven by an animating force called will.

77
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.810
This will rather than our own individual choices.

78
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:17.950
What drives our actions will compels us to eat, breathe, sleep, and importantly,

79
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:21.970
to try to avoid suffering. It's like will be underpaid bus driver.

80
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.040
And we're all passengers stuck in the back of the bus,

81
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.790
unable to get off and dark characters like Jonas struggled to accept this

82
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.460
reality as they continue to believe that they are in fact,

83
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.760
the driver of their own bus, able to change history with their own will.

84
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.330
In fact,

85
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.560
one character's determination to change the future makes him behave so radically

86
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.730
that he gets put in a mental institution in the past. It can be harder,

87
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.680
even impossible to accept that we don't really have control over anything we do

88
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.000
after all we experienced life as a series of actions and the consequences of

89
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:52.720
those actions.

90
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.800
So even as teen Jonas realizes that all of his choices have been predetermined.

91
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.340
The mysterious stranger who is actually adult Jonas from the future,

92
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.760
keeps trying to change the fabric of reality by destroying the wind and

93
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:04.380
wormhole.

94
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.730
<v 2>Wait, wait, I'm gonna get after this, it's been</v>

95
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.410
candies. [inaudible]

96
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.360
[inaudible], [inaudible].

97
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.150
<v 1>Only problem. Even this event has already happened.</v>

98
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:27.120
And we learned that adult Jonas's attempt to close the worm hole is what

99
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:29.220
actually creates it in the first place.

100
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.950
Because your stoner friends from college ganja, Greg was right.

101
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.530
Time is an illusion.

102
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.130
The characters keep messing up their lives because they can't accept that time

103
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.710
is not a one-way street of sequential events.

104
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.070
Rather the things they do in the present can actually affect the past.

105
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.140
They like we experienced time as linear and tend to assume that's the

106
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:52.200
reality. In fact time, according to dark and also, you know,

107
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.060
Einstein is happening all at once everywhere. And every time of course,

108
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.480
people of dark might've realized their faith sooner.

109
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:02.840
If they could have read the first season's opening quote by Einstein himself,

110
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.860
the distinction between the past present and future is only a stubbornly

111
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.140
persistent illusion by season two,

112
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:12.890
our characters start to learn that not only are they unable to change the past,

113
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.570
but they are also completely unable to stop trying to why you guessed it.

114
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.380
The force of will. And in this case, the will to stop their own suffering.

115
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.050
Everyone in wind, in his dealing with emotional wounds,

116
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.130
Jonas can't get over his father's suicide. His mother feels rejected by the men.

117
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:31.400
She loves various people are hurt by their spouses, infidelities,

118
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.400
and many people die tragically, one character,

119
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.290
Claudia experiments with time travel,

120
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.540
hoping to save her daughter who gets cancer in the future,

121
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:42.830
as well as her father who was murdered in the past and Jonas far in the future

122
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.820
tries to save Martha,

123
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.900
his aunt slash lover and everyone else he loves from the end of the world is

124
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.470
constantly trying to stop bad things from happening without succeeding sounds

125
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.170
awful. That's because it is in fact,

126
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:57.050
the very will that makes us take action to avoid suffering.

127
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:00.500
Simultaneously drives us to further suffering. According to Schopenhauer,

128
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:04.490
the world of daily life actually just is suffering and trying to prevent that

129
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:07.550
suffering just makes us more miserable. Like we said,

130
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.680
not a fun hang by this point,

131
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:13.070
the people of wind and may have realized that they're not in control of

132
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.950
anything, but they're also not sure who is that's.

133
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:19.520
When the show suggests that there might be some kind of higher being pulling all

134
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:20.270
the strings.

135
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.830
It introduces add a godlike dude in a church like room who seems very bossy.

136
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.230
So is Adam God, hell no.

137
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.280
He's just an older and uglier version of Jonas in a literalization of

138
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:32.540
Schopenhauer. His philosophy,

139
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.020
young Jonas's innocent desire to save his town from suffering,

140
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.490
leads him to grow into Adam,

141
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.850
an ugly thing responsible for much of his town's suffering.

142
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.250
We see this again at the climax of season two,

143
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.450
as both young Jonas and adult Jonas are trying to stop the death of Martha Young

144
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:49.370
Jonas. Then she dies during the apocalypse,

145
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.450
but adult Jonas knows she dies by gunshot in a sick irony.

146
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.070
Adult Jonas forces her into a bunker with the very gun that all Jonah's

147
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.120
AKA Adam will one day use to murder. Martha is your brain, okay?

148
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:05.930
Right now mine's not. But anyway, Jonas's desire to save.

149
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:10.310
Martha ends up being the very thing that sets all the pieces in place to get her

150
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:12.380
killed. By his own hand,

151
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.220
the creators of dark seemed to agree about the inevitability of certain human

152
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:19.010
behaviors. According to the show's writer, Jontay freeze.

153
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.760
It always comes down to some kind of programming they had before them that you

154
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:25.940
can not choose because you can not let go of this stuff that happened before

155
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:26.240
you,

156
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.660
your past is always pushing you into the direction you're going while at the

157
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:31.520
same time, the future is pulling you,

158
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.860
but there's still one more season of the show.

159
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.930
Is there any hope for our time traveling incest babies?

160
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.980
There is if they can learn to like your laconic teenage brother,

161
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.210
just give less of it. We'll let the show explain season three,

162
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.120
roots it's conflict and the tension between two mirror worlds,

163
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.780
one light and one dark, which are both fighting for control of time travel.

164
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.890
Naturally. Everyone believes that they on the good side,

165
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.180
even as they do very bad things like repeatedly killed their own family members.

166
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.650
So have grown-up Jonas, AKA Adam is the mastermind of one mirror world.

167
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.640
What's going down on the other side. They're in the parallel mirror world.

168
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:12.630
We have Martha now called Eve when mirror Martha kidnaps Jonas.

169
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:13.770
At the end of season two,

170
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.610
we crossover into this mirror timeline where things are sort of different,

171
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.540
but mostly the same. These mirror worlds in the war between Adam and Eve,

172
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.321
AKA old,

173
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:26.760
Jonas and old Martha might make us wonder who's on the right side of this FDF

174
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:30.330
history. If there's new free will and no architect of fate,

175
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.820
is there even such a thing as good and evil,

176
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.870
not according to your favorite party, ruiner Schopenhauer. If the world is,

177
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.960
will, it's an endless striving with no end in sight,

178
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.300
devoid of knowledge and law entirely free.

179
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:44.850
And self-determining within Schopenhauer is vision.

180
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.100
There is no God to be comprehended.

181
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.450
The world is inherently meaningless and therefore beyond any descriptions of

182
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:52.140
good and evil.

183
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.970
So neither Adam Nora Eve is right or wrong as if to literalize this point,

184
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.040
Jonas and Martha's interdimensional baby.

185
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:01.470
A human trilogy of antichrist seems to be,

186
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.430
single-handedly trapping everyone in this hellish timescale and the ultimate

187
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:08.970
interdimensional custody battle. They fight over how to deal with their demon.

188
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:13.620
Baby. Martha has a maternal desire to keep him alive and Jonas wants him dead.

189
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.980
Hoping it will put an end to this ugly time, moral of the story,

190
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.270
maybe having a baby with your aunt from another dimension, isn't the best idea.

191
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.360
And in case you thought we were stretching with all the Schopenhauer stuff.

192
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.020
Season three opens with this quote by the German Lord himself,

193
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.980
man can do what he wills, but he cannot will what he wills.

194
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.940
And the show reaffirms this view by revealing a few remaining secrets about the

195
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.300
town's closed time loop. The apocalypse is unavoidable.

196
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.360
Jonas dad can't be saved no matter what. Oh,

197
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:45.750
and also a number of people end up being their own parent and or grandparent,

198
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:49.710
which would lead to the world's weirdest 23 and me results ever. And again,

199
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.440
everything is inevitable and infinitely repeating.

200
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.000
So upon realizing all of this, what can Jonas and Martha do well,

201
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.380
they can commit a weird type of metaphysical suicide by preventing the event

202
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:03.840
which created each of their timelines in the first place,

203
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.840
by denying their desire to fix their suffering. They might be able to find,

204
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.780
we move past it in a way this is an extreme,

205
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.080
the self-denial that Schopenhauer describes as one cure for human suffering.

206
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.520
According to Schopenhauer,

207
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.270
this type of self sacrifice helps us give up the desire to find meaning and

208
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:21.320
purpose in our suffering.

209
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.130
It's sort of his cranky German version of the moral wisdom that Buddhist monks

210
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.820
have practice long before Netflix was a thing Jonas attempts to remedy his

211
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:31.820
suffering by ending his own life and those of everyone around him,

212
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.220
but this doesn't work. Instead,

213
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:39.110
the creators of dark robbed me of another peaceful slumber by creating a third

214
00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:43.670
dimension, which proceeds the timelines of both Adam and Eve, the origin world.

215
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.960
And it turns out our mural worlds only exist in the first place because of

216
00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:51.650
distraught scientist and clockmaker and the origin world tried to build a time

217
00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:55.240
machine that accidentally reality into those two timelines.

218
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.960
And it's only by stopping the painful event that motivated this mishap,

219
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.530
that Jonas and Martha can destroy their own worlds completely and stop the

220
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:04.840
endless cycle of suffering. Unfortunately,

221
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:07.270
doing so will turn them everyone they know,

222
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:10.330
and all those incest babies into sparkly dust.

223
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.450
<v 3>It's the senior to you.</v>

224
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.940
<v 1>But wait, what about the will to live according to Schopenhauer,</v>

225
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:31.200
if you were to truly realize how hopelessly immoral human nature is,

226
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.080
you'd be so disgusted by the pointless driving of will.

227
00:12:34.081 --> 00:12:38.340
That you'd simply deny it. Like you give up the will to live, resign yourself,

228
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.180
to what it is,

229
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.260
and actually find some tranquility in doing so basically once you realize how

230
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.700
cruelly everything is,

231
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.900
you're able to stop giving and this worry about your suffering a lot less and

232
00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:53.220
Jonas and Martha having fully realized all of this peacefully make the choice to

233
00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:57.540
correct the origin world by saving the clockmakers family in the origin world,

234
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.230
thereby erasing the tragedy that brought themselves into existence.

235
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.430
But isn't this sad,

236
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.030
not really an accepting their role in the perpetuation of suffering across the

237
00:13:06.031 --> 00:13:07.860
multiple generations and timelines.

238
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.480
They're able to do something both moral and selfless, which is to simply let go.

239
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.750
And the show's final scene at a dinner party with the only characters whose

240
00:13:15.751 --> 00:13:19.320
existence hasn't been raised. One character, Hannah describes a dream.

241
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.670
<v 3>[Inaudible] not take us</v>

242
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.630
to satisfy bias.

243
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.670
<v 1>So it sounds a lot like Schopenhauer is tranquility in self denial.</v>

244
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.210
This sentiment that the world is better off without Windon has been previously

245
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:46.044
expressed.

246
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.683
<v 3>Innovate.</v>

247
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.070
<v 1>The repetition of this idea drives home the theme of the show and wind and to</v>

248
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:05.790
erase the world is to erase the tragedy and suffering of existence,

249
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.280
which seems like a total bummer from one perspective.

250
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.210
But the show makes a final choice that actually veers away from Schopenhauer a

251
00:14:12.211 --> 00:14:15.330
bit. Hahna says, she's thinking of naming her new baby Jonas,

252
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.510
and you can make a VAT, vaguely hopeful note, what you will,

253
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.690
maybe it means that there's a future somewhere for Jonas and Martha to be

254
00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:24.900
together after all, or maybe everything is forever.

255
00:14:24.901 --> 00:14:28.020
And your dad is your crushes little brother and your crushes, your aunt,

256
00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:31.080
and by some weird logic, your mother is also your great, great, great,

257
00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:34.830
great grandmother. And why can't Germans just make a happy show.

258
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.040
But what do you think is dark the ultimate exploration of a totally

259
00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:41.250
deterministic universe? Or is there another way to read the ending?

260
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.210

<v 4>Is there someone there? Is this the thing? Did I do the thing, right?</v>

265
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.730
Do you guys have any snacks.
