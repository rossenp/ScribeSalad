<v 0>This video is brought to you by keeps</v>

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.450
What's up. Guys, Jared,

3
00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:11.510
here to talk to you about something that's as American as canceling your Amazon

4
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:15.170
prime trial immediately. After getting two day shipping on a Nintendo switch,

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.170
I'm talking about the art of convincing you to buy stuff.

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.400
Advertising occupies a strange place in our collective imagination.

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.490
We revile it when it interrupts our beloved YouTube videos.

8
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:29.510
We talk about it way too much when it's super bowl season and frequently ignore

9
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:32.660
it unless it features Kendall Jenner, single-handedly ending racism.

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.290
But what if we told you that advertising aside from being an annoying

11
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:40.520
interrupter of content shaped America in ways you never imagined possible,

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.600
want to know how stick around for this wisecrack edition on how advertising

13
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:48.710
changed America and appropriately enough for a video about ads.

14
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:50.900
We want to thank keeps for sponsoring this video,

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.590
spending all this time at home. I've had a chance to reflect on myself.

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.500
There are some things I want to work on and some things that I don't want to

17
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:58.760
change. For example,

18
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.580
I never want to lose my hair and would do anything to prevent it.

19
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.780
After all the key to combating hair loss is prevention keeps makes it easy

20
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:09.770
because they offer FDA approved over the counter and prescription medication and

21
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:13.130
deliver it right to your front door. The process is so easy.

22
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.580
You simply meet with an online doctor and get the medication shipped to your

23
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.310
home. Keeps works to save the hair that you have.

24
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.920
And some men even experienced hair regrowth,

25
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.190
find out why keeps has more five-star reviews than any of its competitors.

26
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.630

So stop stressing and keep your hair. And now back to the show advertising,

30
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:42.231
as we know,

31
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:45.950
it is somewhat of a newcomer in society's development prior to the invention of

32
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:48.740
the printing press. For instance, when most people were illiterate,

33
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.200
advertising mostly took the form of symbols,

34
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.690
like an Advil signifying that you were a blacksmith.

35
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.550
If you walk through a public square,

36
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:59.420
you would often be accosted by enterprising peddlers and public criers who

37
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:02.360
spread news about product shipments, theatrical performances,

38
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.770
and more as time went on as scholar Julian Silka explains in her book, soap,

39
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:10.070
sex and cigarettes advertising continued to reflect the cultural and

40
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:11.840
technological realities of the time.

41
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.810
Naturally when the printing press came around in the 15th century,

42
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.490
it led to an explosion in literacy and soon the emergence of printed ads,

43
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.990
newspapers became widespread in the 16 hundreds and by the 17 hundreds were all

44
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:25.190
aboard the ad train.

45
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.840
But the big campaigns you associate with Campbell soup or Coca-Cola were nowhere

46
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:33.470
to be seen. That is until a little thing called America happened.

47
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.590
And I don't mean America's endless thirst for cocaine, Jews,

48
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.460
English entrepreneurs in the 17th and 18th century tried luring people to the

49
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:41.060
new world,

50
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.260
but the promise of free land in exchange for labor in what was one of the first

51
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:47.870
concerted and sustained advertising campaigns,

52
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.790
condensed history of the modern world.

53
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.350
According to historian Richard Hofstadter, the ads are mostly lost to time,

54
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:56.960
but the sentiment can be seen in engravings of the time,

55
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.870
which typically and creepily embodied America as an Indian queen in a lush

56
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:03.070
landscape ads,

57
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:07.270
accordingly presented America as a garden of Eden full of gold and fountains of

58
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:11.680
youth and abundant land. But this successful plan had one minor hiccup.

59
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.430
America was a total sausage party with men outnumbering.

60
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.740
Women's six to one in Virginia and Maryland.

61
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.650
The Virginia company stepped in with of course,

62
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.990
an ad campaign addressing this lack.

63
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.670
They'd literally give you a wife in exchange for 120 pounds of decent tobacco

64
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.890
cause you know, romance,

65
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.150
but otherwise a world developing America didn't generally have much use for

66
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:38.440
advertising at the time most Americans lived in self-sustaining farms where they

67
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:40.600
produced everything they needed still,

68
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.680
there were some ads and it's very important and depressing to note that a large

69
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:48.610
percentage of them were advertising rewards for black people who had escaped

70
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:53.260
slavery. This was only the beginning of an extremely ugly history of racism and

71
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.120
advertising full of disturbing imagery.

72
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.300
We're not going to show you because woof,

73
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.950
but in the early 18 hundreds sweeping changes about to transform the country and

74
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.790
its advertising for good que the first industrial revolution,

75
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.810
suddenly manufacturers were able to make products so cheaply that it costs less

76
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:14.710
to buy lots of your household goodies than to make them as a new network of

77
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.470
railroads. And waterways began to snake around the country.

78
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.240
Shipping costs fell also growing urbanization meant fewer people growing food,

79
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.910
meaning they had to actually buy it around this time.

80
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:28.330
Crafting advertisements started to become a real profession though.

81
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.530
Not quite Don Draper, Swank defied, good Americans were consuming more,

82
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.790
but our country wasn't primarily driven by consumer spending. Not yet,

83
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:40.930
at least it would take the civil war to really turn American consumption into

84
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:44.350
the engine of our economy. So vocal sites to central reasons,

85
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.420
it changed the entire economy. First,

86
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:50.140
the war mainstream factory made food and clothing amongst hundreds of thousands

87
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.690
of soldiers, thus rendering them more willing to buy,

88
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:56.560
say mass produced suits or canned goods in the future. And second,

89
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:00.190
with all the men at war women now had to pick up the Slack in the fields and at

90
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:03.760
the factories, leaving them less time for their household tasks like cooking,

91
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:07.990
sewing, and soap, making advertisements at the time, weren't very sophisticated,

92
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.110
mostly relying on the hard sell style of advertising,

93
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.560
which is all about capturing the consumers attention in straightforward ways,

94
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.650
telling them why they need your product and why it's the best.

95
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.040
This can be particularly seen in patent medicine ads of the time,

96
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.010
which often hard sold solutions that just didn't work.

97
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.480
Hadn't medicine and medical quackery skyrocketed from the end of the civil war

98
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:32.260
until the end of the century becoming one-third of all American publishers

99
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:33.880
revenue by the turn of the century.

100
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.990
This was in part because so many wounded soldiers became addicted to wartime

101
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:41.980
drugs, which included cocaine and opiate also lousy diets,

102
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.130
lots of disease and increased settlement out West meant more.

103
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:49.990
People didn't have access to a trained doctor. So why not try caskets candy,

104
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:54.490
cathartic patent medicine salesmen also predicted another increasingly important

105
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:57.470
aspect of advertising packaging. You know,

106
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:01.280
the stuff surrounding your new purchase that you promptly discard cheap mass

107
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.750
production of packaging materials.

108
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.690
After the civil war doesn't sound like the most exciting thing in the world,

109
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.360
but trust us, it changed the game completely.

110
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.200
It allowed for brand differentiation and ushered in a host of new marketing

111
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:16.520
techniques, including trademarks. Instead of buying a plain barrel of oatmeal,

112
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.630
people were increasingly saving their money for brand named goods based solely

113
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:25.220
on packaging and branding exemplified by the Quaker oats guy who was born around

114
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.160
this time. But advertisers had a growing problem.

115
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:31.160
They'd have to face a lot of Americans, wary of tacky,

116
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.450
pet and medicine ads found mass consumption and the advertising that fueled it

117
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.310
dishonest and distasteful. So in the final decades of the 19th century,

118
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.360
advertisers tried to rebrand consumerism as a force of progress.

119
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.170
Ads began spotlighting the power of the consumer to contribute to American

120
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:51.110
progress specifically by choosing the right products,

121
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.510
a piano for your budding Bouswami daughter,

122
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.960
the right soap that would make you into a better mother or the stove Polish that

123
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:59.300
would get you into the Congress. No real,

124
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.230
this fit right in with the political values of his time,

125
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.230
which celebrated morality efficiency, many,

126
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:09.040
a successful advertising campaign piggybacked off of technological reforms of

127
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:09.640
the time,

128
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.330
which did everything from mainstream electricity to improve public transit.

129
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.170
This certainly wouldn't be the last time advertisers exploited political values

130
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:20.230
to overcome consumer skepticism, political values.

131
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:23.920
Aside the turn of the 20th century saw the rise of the mass produced luxury,

132
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.911
good product.

133
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:28.240
You probably can't afford that you hadn't heard of until you saw a compelling

134
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:32.320
ad. Consumers needed to be educated about these new products and why they needed

135
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:35.680
them. A prime example was the Kodak camera, a novelty,

136
00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:38.740
which brought the art of photography to the home. In 1888,

137
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.910
you can see the advertiser trying to Sue the unfamiliar aspiring selfie taker

138
00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:46.120
with the slogan. You press the button. We do the rest.

139
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.580
Another luxury product of the era was the bicycle,

140
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.360
which early ads educated consumers on how they even worked in the first place.

141
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.760
Once the product generated a craze, however,

142
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.840
advertisers switched to depicting fun countryside, sporty enjoyment,

143
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.180
and pretty women at the turn of the century.

144
00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:05.860
Advertisers had solidified their strategy into two major schools of thought one,

145
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.540
the affirmation should hard sell,

146
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:11.920
or here's why you need this can opener then to the soft sell or

147
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:13.030
atmospheric ads,

148
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:16.780
which promised that buying a new piano would give you the luxurious lifestyle

149
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:20.770
you've been chasing as we'll see advertisers would often inhibit depending on

150
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:24.250
how healthy or absolutely screwed the economy was.

151
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.780
Start with the good times in the twenties production double as once thrifty

152
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:32.050
Americans started buying expensive products by installment.

153
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.590
All ad people had to do was come up with creative ways to separate folks from

154
00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:39.760
their money. And boy did they succeed lifestyle and leisure ads,

155
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:43.540
reign Supreme portraying the message that consuming wasn't about buying what you

156
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:47.530
needed to survive. It was about buying what you wanted to enhance your status.

157
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.250
Ad makers stress this through their frequent portrayals of upper-class women who

158
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:54.700
indulged in the fashions of the time and not just fashionable clothes.

159
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.430
So notes that in this age,

160
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.690
manufacturers began using color and designed to sell everything from box to

161
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.240
silverware, to underway in the process.

162
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:07.770
She writes manufacturers transformed utilitarian staples into fashion goods.

163
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.760
You'll need a hat and handbag to match your new shoes. And so on.

164
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.310
Not only did advertisers invent reasons,

165
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:16.950
you needed different handbags to match your different shoes,

166
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.670
they invented all kinds of other weird reasons. You needed to buy their stuff.

167
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.530
Hilariously cool advertisements,

168
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:27.180
shamed women by inventing fake medical terms like halitosis I E bad

169
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:30.210
breath and warning them that they would be often a bridesmaid,

170
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:33.180
but never a bride unless they bought breath. Deodorant.

171
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.020
This is also around the time where razor manufacturers decided to double their

172
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:40.500
market by convincing women that they needed to shave their legs and pits.

173
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.140
But a problem comes with economic growth.

174
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.880
How do you get people to buy even more after your consumer buys one toaster,

175
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:50.790
they may not need another one for years or decades,

176
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.290
and that's not good for business.

177
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.060
So advertisers invent even more kinds of soft selling in the 1950s

178
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.680
manufacturers began employing dynamic obsolescence and nicer term for planned

179
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:05.850
obsolescence that focused on design and colors. Whereas in the past,

180
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:08.970
you might've kept your toaster for all 10 years of its functionality.

181
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.200
You would now to start it in favor of a cuter hipper toaster and do so with a

182
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:16.140
smile in the wake of America's new economic power.

183
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.070
This strategy helped foster the strongest consumer economy we'd ever seen.

184
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.520
This was a time when consumers bought things on credit and they were encouraged

185
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:26.100
to own two cars, several television sets,

186
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.690
and two shop excessively colored towels and handbags weren't enough anymore.

187
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.620
The central status symbol at the time was a modern kitchen with a new color.

188
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.230
The appliances doubling as fashion statements,

189
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.370
the rising prominence of psychology also gave advertisers some new tools to work

190
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:45.840
with people's subconscious cue motivation research, or Mr.

191
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.290
Which employed similar psychoanalytical tools used by father of public

192
00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:50.700
relations. Edward Bernays,

193
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:55.230
as early as the 1920s motivation research had to figure out why people bought

194
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:57.870
things on both the subconscious and unconscious level,

195
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.830
suggesting that consumers don't actually know what they want and said,

196
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:05.550
seek out items for two main motivators sex and secure.

197
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.480
As a result of bra ads tried to tap into women's supposedly exhibitionist

198
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:12.150
tendencies, all camel cigarettes, route them with doctors,

199
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:14.040
assurances that smoking was good for you.

200
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.630
Skip ahead to the 1980s and you'll see a consumer market much like the 1950s,

201
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.350
but on lots of cocaine, people didn't just want to keep up with the Joneses.

202
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.510
They wanted to blow them out of the water.

203
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.220
Advertisers were all about reaching the ultra consumer who drank Perrier or

204
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:33.810
Ralph Lauren and drove a Mercedes ultra consumers also worked their butts off in

205
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:34.950
pursuit of nice things.

206
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.970
Leaving Alka seltzer to make a commercial promising relief for the stress of

207
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:42.060
success. Of course, prosperity can't last forever.

208
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:45.210
And advertisers have repeatedly over the 20th century,

209
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.030
had to relearn how to sell to thrifty folks.

210
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.840
This occurred most notably after the collapse of the stock market in 1929,

211
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.140
cue the hard, but make it neat. Many 1930s ads,

212
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.070
prey quite openly on existing emotions like guilt, fear, shame,

213
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.330
blame adds warned mothers of the perils of not buying their children milk and

214
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.200
urged men to buy Fleischmann's yeast cakes or risk being a failure.

215
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.030
Again in 1975,

216
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.690
advertisers would be faced with a quandary of selling to people who didn't have

217
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.760
much money after another recession.

218
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.600
Naturally they revive the great depression style, hard sell aggression,

219
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.610
especially through monotonous repetition.

220
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.063
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

221
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:31.320
<v 0>Puts it. Creativity had turned into a rational quantifiable science with ads,</v>

222
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:34.890
less interested in fashion or lifestyle than in convincing consumers that their

223
00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:38.400
products would get the job done. Even when pocket books were light,

224
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.280
advertisers came in heavy. Of course,

225
00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:44.970
there's one decade that doesn't quite fit the mold of human Buster advertising

226
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.350
the 1960s.

227
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.820
Similar to how in the 1890s advertisers had to appeal to progress to make up for

228
00:12:50.821 --> 00:12:53.130
the bad rap marketing had gotten sixties.

229
00:12:53.131 --> 00:12:56.700
Advertisers had to deal with open hostility to consumerism brought on by

230
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.313
counterculture and hippies.

231
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.790
So to not seem like some kind of lame stiff advertising, embraced creativity,

232
00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:04.860
liberation, and sticking it to the man.

233
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.110
This is best exemplified by one of the decades.

234
00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:09.960
Most famous campaigns that have the VW beetle,

235
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.520
these ads were creative self-deprecating and emphasize the unchanging nature of

236
00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:15.354
the VW.

237
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.930
Soon advertisers started targeting the youth with psychedelic imagery and

238
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.870
younger models. They also convinced the generation of people.

239
00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:25.650
I eat boomers who allegedly care about planet earth to embrace disposable,

240
00:13:25.651 --> 00:13:30.030
everything from blow-up furniture to pop art ceramics advertisers also

241
00:13:30.031 --> 00:13:33.480
piggybacked off the burgeoning movement for civil rights and women's rights

242
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.000
incorporating, or if you're cynical like us,

243
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.880
arguably co-opted their messaging into advertising,

244
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.170
but we haven't talked about the two gigantic leaps in advertising technology,

245
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.790
television, and the internet commercial broadcasting began in the 1940s.

246
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.770
And by 1960 advertisers could reach nearly every American home via the boob

247
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.940
tube. But at first TV advertising looked a lot different than it does today.

248
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.650
Early television programming was largely controlled entirely by their sponsors.

249
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.500
For example, I love Lucy was owned by Philip Morris.

250
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.320
One of the first TV hits was the Texaco star theater,

251
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.370
which both opened and closed on a shot of four Texaco gas station worker

252
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.030
singing.

253
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.930
This was all fine and good until the trademark fifties network quiz shows were

254
00:14:15.931 --> 00:14:20.100
revealed to be rigged by advertisers who kept popular contestants on the show

255
00:14:20.101 --> 00:14:24.570
longer in order to earn more money networks and advertisers alike soon renounced

256
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:28.260
entirely sponsored content. And instead adopted commercial breaks.

257
00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:32.610
We have come to know and hate relaxed regulation on advertisers in the 1980s

258
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.620
also meant the introduction of infomercials,

259
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.340
which allow your advertisement to go on and on and on.

260
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.290
Also increasingly ads became embedded in movies and TV shows by an increasing

261
00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:44.790
use of product placement.

262
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.300
Thus further blurring the line between entertainment and advertising,

263
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.030
which brings us to the internet a whole new way,

264
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.280
advertisers to capture people's attention if they can only get them to click.

265
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.360
And as we'll see that weird lack of distinction between advertisement and

266
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:03.470
content seen in the Texaco star theater will really, and truly haunt us.

267
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.920
We have to start with the beginning, the banner ad and the pop-up ad,

268
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.120
which redirected you to the typically very janky homepage of a mega corporation,

269
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.140
early internet advertising work hard to differentiate the ad from the regular

270
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:17.540
website content highly effective. At first,

271
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.450
the first banner ad for at T and T in 1994,

272
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.820
got 44% of viewers to click on it.

273
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.030
But we're soon dismissed as boring and ineffective today,

274
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:31.010
fewer than 0.1% of users click on a given banner ad. Unlike TV,

275
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:34.700
the internet has always been a tricky place to advertise because consumers are

276
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:38.240
in control over what they interact with or are willing to sit through.

277
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.590
But in the new millennium,

278
00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:43.100
advertisers would go from wanting to get your attention to wanting to get

279
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.440
something more your heart.

280
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.190
And the two thousands advertising got really personal with brands wanting to

281
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:51.290
form relationships with their consumers.

282
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.790
The product itself becomes increasingly irrelevant and sometimes even invisible.

283
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.390
Like this is an advertisement for Cadbury. What's more,

284
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:03.320
the rise of social media created new ways for consumers to interact with brands,

285
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.580
which has been exploited to varying usually humorous and troubling degrees

286
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.610
brands will now just straight up, try to act like people.

287
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.630
The goal is if you feel fondly about the olive gardens, social media presence,

288
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.210
it's a lot more likely that you're not just going to buy a basket of

289
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.930
breadsticks.

290
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.890
You're going to be the envy of your friends and buy a freaking pasta pass.

291
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:24.260
<v 3>It. Wasn't.</v>

292
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.690
<v 0>Just brands trying to connect with you on a personal level.</v>

293
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.850
Advertisements themselves became personalized. We saw the rise of targeted ads,

294
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:36.170
which required consumer surveillance often on the part of online mega giants

295
00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:40.310
like Google and Facebook who have increasingly intricate profiles of each user

296
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:43.370
based on search history, demographics and interests.

297
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.290
Probably the biggest development of the time though,

298
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:49.280
is the way advertising has become increasingly stealthy on the internet.

299
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.330
Banner ads and popups were largely replaced with search advertising in big part,

300
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:56.180
thanks to Google's invention of ad sense in 2003,

301
00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:00.770
which allows any web publisher to host cost per click contextual ads based on

302
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:01.880
Google search history.

303
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.420
This can obviously make it more difficult to distinguish between real search

304
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:08.540
results and promoted sites. Another growing phenomenon,

305
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.680
native advertising allows for everything from sponsored editorial content that

306
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:17.330
seamlessly incorporates a brand into a news article to Instagram influencers,

307
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:19.700
invisibly, integrating ads for vitamin gummies,

308
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.570
ultimately making the line between ad and information slash entertainment,

309
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.410
all but invisible way more subtle version of the Texaco show.

310
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.250
Content marketing too has exploded with corporations producing their own

311
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:33.080
magazines games. And of course,

312
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:37.700
viral videos often focused on addressing consumer needs as seen in the lows

313
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.950
fixed in six home improvement ads,

314
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.360
increasingly we're consuming advertising without realizing or in spite of it

315
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:49.010
being advertising possibly the best example of a 21st century corporation

316
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.950
pursuing all the possibilities of the new age of advertising can be seen with

317
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:53.784
red bull,

318
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:57.570
which has over the past two decades checked all the modern marketing boxes with

319
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:01.980
its own media company that produces TV, magazines, music games, and more.

320
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.760
They employed everything from celebrity slash influencer endorsements to

321
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:09.420
sponsoring music festivals, to acquiring thousands of brand ambassadors,

322
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:11.100
to hand out their product for free.

323
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.970
They also host events like break dancing competitions and organized social media

324
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:17.130
stunts like this guy jumping from space.

325
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.030
Of course the result is a weird advertiser mediated reality.

326
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.430
When our news can be sponsored by jet blue,

327
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.450
a sporting event can be planned and executed by red bull and even dollar shave

328
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:30.930
club has its own media arm, which to be honest is weirdly good.

329
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.990
How much of our culture is just some weird way to sell you something?

330
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.250
Will there be some backlash like there was against sponsored game shows or are

331
00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:41.700
we stuck in this nightmare forever, but what do you guys think?

332
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.680
Let us know in the comments, big, big,
