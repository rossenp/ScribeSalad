<v 0>This video is brought to you by surf shark, VPN.</v>

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.010
<v 1>What's up guys? Michael here don't freak out,</v>

3
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:14.030
but I want to talk to you today about reality dating shows and love. Now I know,

4
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:16.910
I know they're fake trashy and probably bad for your brain,

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.870
but what if we can learn something in the midst of these named cat fights over

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:21.860
champagne bottles,

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.360
the unbelievability absurdity and straight up tacking this of these shows has

8
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:26.811
led many,

9
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:31.160
a spoilsport grownup to declare reality TV dating shows a uniquely modern plague

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.210
signaling the complete collapse of society. And honestly, we get it,

11
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.330
but maybe in this producer, fabricated reality,

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.690
there's actually nothing particularly modern or new going on.

13
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.100
What have we told you that the very things we mock reality TV stars for doing on

14
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.270
the respect of dating shows STEM from weird love standards invented by dreamy

15
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.870
eyed writers in the 18th and 19th century and worse.

16
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.280
What if we told you that your probably just as guilty of it as this very

17
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.490
unpleasant man, welcome to this wisecracking edition on reality.

18
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.510
TV's lies about love and spoilers ahead for your own love life.

19
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.010
But before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to this week. Sponsors,

21

especially when you spend all your time online. Right now,

22
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:19.370
I am using my credit card all over the internet, getting books, running movies,

23
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.260
and even purchasing groceries for pickup.

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.850
It makes me nervous to input my info on so many different sites, but with a VPN,

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.000
I know that I'm safe while connected to a VPN.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.650

40
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.510
And now a quick caveat. There are tons of reality dating shows,

41
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.800
but for our purposes,

42
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.460
we're going to focus on a few culturally significant ones that seem to share a

43
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:27.200
perspective on love. Specifically,

44
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.060
the bachelor slash bachelorette love is blind and the 90 day fiance televisual

45
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:34.700
universe. Now look, we know what you're thinking,

46
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.380
why even bother analyzing the way love is portrayed on reality TV when it's ever

47
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.590
more apparent that tons of people are at least partially going on.

48
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:45.350
These shows in the hopes of scoring some profitable skincare sponsorships,

49
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.290
or at the very least to boost their Instagram following.

50
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.560
<v 0>I have 310,000 followers right now.</v>

51
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.570
It goes up usually every single day.

52
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.040
<v 1>Indeed the inherent less for fame that we see on most reality TV dating shows</v>

53
00:02:58.041 --> 00:02:59.150
can't be denied.

54
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.580
And those ulterior motives are a phenomenon in and of themselves. However,

55
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:07.390
we in some scholars still think it's worthwhile looking at the kinds of romantic

56
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:09.670
narratives that these actors slash real people,

57
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:13.540
who we will henceforth referred to as characters choose to enact and that their

58
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:18.100
producers choose to well produce because even when it's fake or

59
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.000
inauthentic,

60
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.140
these characters are still parroting ideas about love that are upon closer

61
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:28.060
examination either Jerious strange and also quite ubiquitous for those who are

62
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.280
uninitiated in the trash fire of reality.

63
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.390
Love a quick overview on the bachelor and bachelorette one man or woman.

64
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.290
It's a giant pool of potential soulmates eliminating contestants each week until

65
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:41.950
they found the person they're apparently going to marry and love is blind.

66
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.610
A few dozen singles date and serve real pods of them ever actually seen one

67
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:48.070
another and try to find love some, get engaged,

68
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:50.950
and then try to see if they can successfully make it down the aisle.

69
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.390
On the various 90 day,

70
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:56.590
fiance shows Americans struggle with their overseas relationships and see where

71
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.800
their love can transcend continents, visa restrictions. I'm sweating.

72
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.690
<v 2>I'm worried about this, this, this visa now, and lack of air conditioning.</v>

73
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.580
I'm like hot. I'm sweaty.

74
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.570
I'm starting to freak out a little bit. So.

75
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.140
<v 1>What could these clearly troubled 20 somethings lusting after each other</v>

76
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.460
possibly have to do with 18th and 19th century writers to explain we'll need to

77
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.550
leave through a very brief history of love in Western civilization.

78
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.000
As philosopher Simon may outlines in his book, love a history.

79
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.720
There have been four major transformations in the way Western civilization to

80
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.740
find love.

81
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.850
The first occurred in biblical times and concerned the value of love basically

82
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:33.510
in this era,

83
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.530
love became the Supreme virtue because it specifically signified the bond

84
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:42.360
between the human and God. Divine love was at the time all the rage.

85
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.660
The second change began around the fourth century and concerned the power of

86
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:49.920
love in this framing, loving God could make you yourself divine.

87
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.180
The third change began in the 11th century and was all about the object of love.

88
00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:58.620
I heed the person being loved once. Exclusively reserved for God.

89
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.480
Divine love could be bestowed upon a lowly human being is specially if they were

90
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.240
hot, that brings us to the fourth change, which occurred in the 18th centuries,

91
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:10.380
spurred in part by the contributions of philosopher and Loverboy.

92
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.940
Jacques were so, and later by other key figures of the romanticism movement,

93
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.230
this change was concerned with the lover who becomes authentic through love from

94
00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:20.064
this perspective,

95
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.090
romantically loving another person is what's really divine and what's more,

96
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.710
it's all but essential to developing your true nature. Ultimately, as Mae puts,

97
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.530
it love comes to fall in love with itself.

98
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.940
Now probably we assume slash hope that people loved each other before the

99
00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:37.560
romantic writers put quilt to paper,

100
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.520
but at any rate there wasn't the same intellectual framework around love.

101
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.590
Loving another person in this era became divine. According to may,

102
00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:50.460
this era of romantic love is still alive and well today. In fact,

103
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:54.480
he argues that the notion of love is a radical divine experience in which you

104
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:57.530
discover your true self and become complete. You.

105
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.550
<v 3>Complete me.</v>

106
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.440
<v 1>As only become more salient over time. And for two reasons,</v>

107
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.630
first religion has become less important.

108
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.780
Leaving a vacuum in the absence of divine love. Second,

109
00:06:10.781 --> 00:06:14.770
our society has become more individualistic and less explicitly hierarchical.

110
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.670
We can choose our own romantic partners for a little extra context.

111
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:19.630
For most of history.

112
00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:23.440
Marriage had more to do with property transfer and political alliances than it

113
00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:27.190
ever had to do with lusting over a person who likes the same books issue because

114
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:30.790
we now have more freedom in the development of our personhood Love's ability to

115
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.550
help us achieve that makes it seem ever more crucial.

116
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.560
And this isn't without its problems.

117
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.330
We're not trying to show on your ideas of fairytale romance, but well, okay.

118
00:06:40.331 --> 00:06:44.230
Maybe we are as a result of hundreds of years of philosophizing about it,

119
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.430
love now labors under the insane expectations that you should essentially feel

120
00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:50.260
about our relationship that we developed.

121
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.400
Lee religious person feels about their God, but Hey, no pressure.

122
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.040
You don't have to take Mae's word for it either.

123
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.840
We all know that society rhapsodizes the craft of romantic love and use a

124
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:05.320
person's inability to find it as a pretty objective failure.

125
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.550
I'm going to die alone,

126
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.810
but what did these smooch happy writers like were so think love could do for a

127
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:12.430
person. According to may,

128
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.320
there were two major motifs first that you can achieve personal authenticity

129
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.070
or the quest to become yourself and dedicating yourself to a loved one.

130
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:22.990
And in being loved second,

131
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.550
the nobility of passion and even sexual desire as a great source of goodness and

132
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:28.384
truth.

133
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.230
So TLDR a love makes you more authentically yourself and be your passion is

134
00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:36.970
divine. Now to be clear,

135
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:40.000
we've got no beef with romanticism and its predecessors.

136
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.510
It was indeed a profoundly important movement and affirming the importance of

137
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:44.890
individuality, of honest,

138
00:07:44.891 --> 00:07:49.450
emotional expression and a host of other generally good occasionally sublime

139
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:53.170
things. The problem is according to me, our views on love.

140
00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:57.040
Haven't evolved since we're so gushed about is crushed and that's made for a

141
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.140
whole lot of achy breaky hearts.

142
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.440
But what does this all have to do with spending over a hundred thousand dollars

143
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:05.230
on a woman you met on a sketchy Ukrainian dating site?

144
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.670
A lot actually in his book may outlines many myths about love that have been

145
00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:13.900
propagated by this whole romantic love, his divine idea. And upon inspection,

146
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:18.880
we realized that reality TV is a masterclass in dumb ideas about love.

147
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.240
So let's go through a few of May's myths myth. Number one,

148
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.560
love is unconditional.

149
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.610
It is neither aroused nor diminished by the other's value or qualities.

150
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.820
It is a spontaneous gift that seeks nothing for the giver.

151
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.080
The notion of unconditional love is according to may the most salient and the

152
00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:38.470
most harmful of all love myths propagated in our society.

153
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.640
And it is also arguably the one most reinforced by many dating shows,

154
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.410
unsurprisingly some of the most horrible toxic people are really into this idea

155
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.190
on the show before the 90 days about Americans finding love abroad,

156
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.490
one couple constantly screams about each other's manipulative behavior,

157
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.910
drinking and alleged physical assault.

158
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.130
<v 4>She chose shoes at my head.</v>

159
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.770
<v 1>And yet they persisted at least for awhile.</v>

160
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.320
Why try to power through such unbecoming,

161
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.810
occasionally dangerous behavior from your partner? Well,

162
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:08.100
it's all in the name of it,

163
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.330
working things out and honoring your true and pure love, which by the way,

164
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.210
if any of these things sound like your own relationship,

165
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.090
please don't or for another example,

166
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.510
consider the guy who immediately breaks off his seemingly normal relationship

167
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:25.380
with a woman. He just met because in his mind, if she truly loved him,

168
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.310
she would know immediately and unconditionally that you wants to marry him after

169
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.360
knowing him for a few weeks.

170
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.520
<v 4>Maybe we are no, always too quick.</v>

171
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.480
<v 1>Similarly,</v>

172
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.990
other subjects who are almost definitely getting scammed and or catfished,

173
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.621
basically,

174
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:44.210
excuse a long series of red flags is just an obstacle in their fairy tale of

175
00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:45.320
unconditional love.

176
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.130
<v 3>I know it'll just raise more red flags with my children.</v>

177
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.740
It's easy for them to think bad of Williams and think he's scamming me,

178
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.460
but they don't know him. Like I know him.

179
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.660
<v 1>The bachelor and the bachelorette where the titular characters starts out dating</v>

180
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.100
over two dozen people,

181
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.400
all of whom are asked to repress their jealousy and their discomfort in the

182
00:10:07.401 --> 00:10:09.320
hopes of finding true love with the lead.

183
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:14.360
<v 3>I'm not going to do what Ben did. I'm not going to fall in love with two girls.</v>

184
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.350
I'm going to fall in love with you.

185
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.640
<v 1>From the get-go.</v>

186
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.990
Each contestant is agreeing to emotionally untenable circumstances filled with

187
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:24.950
constant jealousy and anxiety in exchange for maybe finding love. And yes,

188
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:28.880
we know being on TV, but things get even trickier near the end.

189
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.200
When we have four characters,

190
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.200
all of whom typically seem genuinely invested in the lead,

191
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.480
taking them to their home towns. At this point,

192
00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:40.280
it is by now almost formulaically required for each contestant to verbally

193
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:44.360
express their love to the point where not doing so can literally get them sent

194
00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:45.194
home.

195
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.710
What could be more unconditional than telling someone you love them in the hopes

196
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:52.550
of forging a monogamous marital relationship while they're dating three other

197
00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:55.430
people. This results in competitively, lavished,

198
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:57.650
declarations and promises of forever love.

199
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.020
<v 5>There's nothing I ever wanted more just to look at you and like be here</v>

200
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.970
wherever we are though. You know,

201
00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:08.510
we could be in a little apartment trying to argue about what the paint were put

202
00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:10.880
on the walls. You know, like I just want to be there.

203
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.740
<v 1>Then look that is sweet as hell.</v>

204
00:11:12.741 --> 00:11:16.580
But as my new love consultant may would put it love, like everything.

205
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:20.210
Human is conditioned. You probably wouldn't still love your wife.

206
00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:23.210
If she plays the trumpet every day at sunrise or your boyfriend,

207
00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:24.200
if he murdered your cat.

208
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.240
<v 4>I have this crazy thought that I know is crazy that</v>

209
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.040
maybe Dwight killed my cat.

210
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.750
<v 1>Onto myths to love transports us beyond the messy imperfections of the everyday</v>

211
00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:38.870
world. And two weeks of superior state purity and perfection.

212
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.830
This is most literally propagated by the format of some of these shows where

213
00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:46.880
contestants are swept away to sublime beaches, surreal modernist pods,

214
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.670
and various beautiful locales all over the globe.

215
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.040
This of course reinforces our notion of love as a fantasy best enacted in

216
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:58.390
fantasy locations. Then there's the insane requirements demanded of contestants.

217
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:00.460
You need to drop everything and pursuit of love.

218
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.830
Oftentimes giving up your job in the process.

219
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.930
<v 4>Everything could be here.</v>

220
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.590
<v 1>Or if you're a man from San Diego, looking for love in the Philippines,</v>

221
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.090
you might just liquidate your only retirement savings to make one big

222
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.020
romantic play.

223
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.590
But it's also embodied in the way contestants are depicted upon arrival.

224
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.510
They're often posited as missing that special someone I E a partner snoring next

225
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:23.340
to them in bed.

226
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.080
<v 4>I wanted to show you that I do have a heart on my finger and it's</v>

227
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.250
open. Okay?

228
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.030
And I hope that you'll be the guy to complete it as your things have happened.

229
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:33.630
Yes.

230
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.770
<v 1>Of course this hopeful ladies introduction has darker implications that she is</v>

231
00:12:37.771 --> 00:12:38.970
literally incomplete,

232
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.880
not a fully formed person without romantic love in her life.

233
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.510
Perhaps more troubling me. Our fr mentioned 90 day love searcher.

234
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.400
Darcy expresses hopes that.

235
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.300
<v 2>He's going to take it upon himself to make me feel like a woman.</v>

236
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.140
<v 1>Of course,</v>

237
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.970
necessarily implies that Darcy can't embrace a rebel in her own womanhood

238
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:02.010
without the express approval and assistance of a particular type of man and

239
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.210
onto myth three, that love is our highest duty to ourselves.

240
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.380
Promoting this belief is almost mandatory for any contestants on a reality TV

241
00:13:10.381 --> 00:13:15.090
dating show, As previously mentioned,

242
00:13:15.091 --> 00:13:18.660
new characters are often introduced primarily by their lack or the flaw that has

243
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:20.840
made them until this point, unable to find.

244
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.780
<v 2>I deal in produce for one thing I haven't produced yet.</v>

245
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.370
<v 1>This makes sense purely from a story perspective,</v>

246
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.150
audiences care about characters with defined goals that they pursue.

247
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.170
But here it suggests that this lack of romantic love overwhelms the good of

248
00:13:34.171 --> 00:13:37.560
personal accomplishment, supportive family, and so on. What's more,

249
00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:41.430
the competitive nature of some shows further reinforces the idea that love is an

250
00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:44.100
aspiration, a prize to be won for oneself.

251
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.790
<v 4>I came here to win this. No girls are getting in my way.</v>

252
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.720
<v 1>This supports May's notion that the divinity of romantic love is inextricably</v>

253
00:13:51.721 --> 00:13:54.780
tied up with the rise of individualization and self determinism.

254
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.440
You are in charge of your love life and its failures are your failing.

255
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.260
So you better win this contest.

256
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.820
It also manifests and contestants swearing that they don't really fully exist

257
00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:07.350
without the object of their love.

258
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.450
<v 2>I can't believe it's happened. I have to do all this alone afterwards now.</v>

259
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.840
<v 1>And keeping with an amaz earlier points in this era of love.</v>

260
00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:19.110
We focus so much on the lover and what they want. And quote,

261
00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:22.740
unquote deserve as to render the beloved, almost an accessory.

262
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.950
You get the sense that this woman could be crying over pilot, Pete,

263
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:27.450
or Colton or whoever the hell.

264
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.130
This is the point is what the men and women have really invested in is the

265
00:14:32.131 --> 00:14:34.440
idea of loving nowhere.

266
00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:38.100
Is this more apparent than when a catfish the victim on before the 90 days talks

267
00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:39.510
about why he, for example,

268
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.440
flew thousands of miles on several occasions where a girl that's straight up

269
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.880
ghosted him every time.

270
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.460
<v 2>You tried to go on a cruise with her.</v>

271
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.070
And that didn't happen because of her medical reasons, right? For him, he's.

272
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.000
<v 1>Invested thousands of hours and dollars into this relationship. Fittingly,</v>

273
00:14:56.001 --> 00:15:00.080
the language of investment comes up a lot on this particular show or when a

274
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:01.910
woman who is definitely getting catfished,

275
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:04.880
fondly recalls countless hours of texting and phone calls.

276
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.660
Even after it becomes pretty clear that her English boyfriend is probably a

277
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:09.680
Nigerian scammer.

278
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.560
<v 3>Someone who hacked his account, must've got a hold of my address.</v>

279
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.130
You gave away your address. I'm still in love with you.

280
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.060
<v 1>Now.</v>

281
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.500
Even if all of the clips we've looked at were constructed by devilishly adept

282
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.730
and manipulative producers,

283
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.660
they still demonstrate something important are socially endorsed philosophies

284
00:15:31.661 --> 00:15:33.940
about love taking to their logical extreme,

285
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.990
but what's wrong with hanging onto a few sweet myths about romance? Well,

286
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.030
according to may, the problem is this.

287
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.120
When we view love as all of these magical things,

288
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.660
we set ourselves up for disappointment and upon being disappointed,

289
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.080
our love easily lurches to the opposite, extreme bitterly,

290
00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:54.250
resenting loved ones in whom so much hope had been invested and writing off love

291
00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:55.570
as brutal or impossible.

292
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.703
<v 3>I</v>

293
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.113
do not believe it loud.

294
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.510
<v 1>And it's not just renouncing love it's well, this.</v>

295
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.640
<v 3>We can keep going. Mate.</v>

296
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.600
<v 1>The reason things get so particularly dramatic and crazy is because in this</v>

297
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:23.170
case, rejection is very, very public and expectations.

298
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.200
I E lifelong love are very high. Okay.

299
00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:29.800
But you might still be wondering if it's a reality constructed by a SWAT team of

300
00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:34.630
editors who really cares well when reality TV couples parrot cliche ideas

301
00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:35.830
about love for the millions.

302
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.940
It very quickly stops being about them and starts being about us.

303
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.500
Why is that blame it on something called an effect or what scholar Misha Kafka

304
00:16:44.501 --> 00:16:49.000
calls the zone of potential emotions or the primordial soup of feelings.

305
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.170
It also serves as the cusp that brings the individual person into the collective

306
00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:54.760
psyche. According to Kafka,

307
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.660
TB is a remarkably important purveyor of aspect in today's society.

308
00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:03.100
A conjoining divider that connects us to those outside our immediate purview.

309
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.310
When you emote even a little as Tyler's heart is broken,

310
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.800
whereas Darcy pursues love with hopeless vigor.

311
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.780
The TD becomes a conduit of social aspect for you. What's more cop guard used.

312
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.980
The consequences of dating shows for our aspect is particularly salient because

313
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.850
as a work of reality TV, it is a constructed on mediation.

314
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.110
That is a lot of work goes into making it feel like a simulation of reality.

315
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.380
And even though we know that this reality is mediated,

316
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.960
the effect of seen real people dating still,

317
00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:35.440
both simulates as well as stimulates. What's more,

318
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.250
CAFCA argues the choices that these characters have to make mirror the choices

319
00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:42.880
that we, our cells are forced to make in the dating world and imitating while

320
00:17:42.881 --> 00:17:45.490
exaggerating the stakes of our own romantic lives.

321
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:50.040
Kafka says these shows bring to light aspects of love practices that are indeed

322
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:51.570
conflictual and contradictory.

323
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.470
That is how are we supposed to find practical lasting love in a world that's

324
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:59.130
obsessed with both Tinder's wiping and magical soulmates.

325
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.760
So are we all destined to keep parenting myths about love?

326
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.410
Is there any hope for us? Don't despair may has a solution.

327
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.530
He proposes embracing a new different definition of love.

328
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:13.920
That is based on the feeling he calls ontological rootedness,

329
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:18.900
