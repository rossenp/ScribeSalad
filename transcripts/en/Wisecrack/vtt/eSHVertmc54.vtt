<v 0>This video is brought to you by mischief.</v>

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.030
<v 1>Hey wisecrack, somehow even longer haired Jared here and today,</v>

3
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:14.300
we're talking about a movie that bitterly divides the wisecrack team.

4
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.410
We've spent hours going back and forth on our self isolated Skype calls on

5
00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:20.540
whether the film is deep or dumb.

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.430
Zack Snyder's Watchman those of us on the pro watchman's deep side,

7
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:28.850
contend that Zack Snyder, playfully twists Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons,

8
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:33.140
Seminole comic injecting his own signature style to satirize pop culture and

9
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:35.570
comic book films. Nowadays. However,

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.350
those of us that think watchman's dumb claim Snyder not only completely missed

11
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.930
the point of Moore's graphic novel, but betrays,

12
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:46.730
everything Watchman originally stood for. So who's right. Well, let's dig in,

13
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:50.750
in this wisecrack condition on Zack Snyder's Watchman deep or dumb,

14
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.640
but before we get into it,

15
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.920
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor mischief.

16
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.360
If you don't know what mischief is,

17
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:59.930
it's a company that releases drops every two weeks ranging from viral digital

18
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:01.880
experiences to high price items.

19
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.520
That means in the past they've dropped Jesus' shoes,

20
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.380
a $1,425 pair of sneakers with Holy water in the souls that sold out instantly

21
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.870
and were subsequently featured on late night with Seth Meyers,

22
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.370
a text message bot that generates AI feet picks and the office Slack,

23
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.120
where they recreated all 201 episodes of the office inside of Slack,

24
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.970
just as if Michael and Dwight were working together in 2020,

25
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.100
none of their drops have ever been the same.

26
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.450
So you never know what you're going to get.

27
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
You may have seen some of these go viral on Reddit or even cable news.

28
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.020
So here's how you can get access to their future drops before anyone else.

29
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.980
They recently released an app to allow fans to get drops early drops can sell

30
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:37.761
out within seconds.

31
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.730
So the earlier you can get access to the better chance you'll have to secure a

32
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:44.660
drop fans will also be able to access exclusive drops twice a month and see what

33
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:48.080
items have been dropped in the past. So download the mischief app today,

34
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:50.510
by going to M S C H f.com.

35
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.640
That's M S C H f.com or search S C H F in the app store or

36
00:01:55.641 --> 00:02:00.290
on Google play. And now back to the show, a quick note, before we begin,

37
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.740
there are three different cuts of Watchman available for the purposes of this

38
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:07.550
video. We're going to go with Zack Snyder and analyze his preferred version.

39
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.840
<v 0>For me, the director's cut is really the, you know, which has the house's death.</v>

40
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:12.674
And.

41
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.690
<v 1>All right, let's get into a quick recap.</v>

42
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.500
The film opens in an alternate timeline where the emergence of anonymous heroes

43
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.780
has dramatically changed the world. As we know it,

44
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.920
the U S won the Vietnam war and Richard Nixon is now serving his third term as

45
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:26.600
president in 1985,

46
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.500
but cold war tensions between the Soviets and the us have reached a tipping

47
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:34.070
point each side on the precipice of firing nuclear warheads,

48
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.210
making things worse. Former vigilantes are beginning to mysteriously die.

49
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.250
The comedian and early mass Touro is found dead flung from his apartment window.

50
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.473
The murder prompts,

51
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.770
another mask vigilante war shack to investigate and warn other prominent crime

52
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:53.180
fighters of the impending danger. These include night owl, silk Spectre,

53
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.520
Ozymandias, and the Superman himself.

54
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.300
Dr. Manhattan turns out all these murders were a distraction.

55
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.060
Ozymandias says master plan to kill millions of people and frame Dr.

56
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.893
Manhattan,

57
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.950
why you might ask well to unite the Soviet union and the United States against a

58
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.460
common enemy, thus averting nuclear Holocaust. Now,

59
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.660
before we can determine if Snyder either betrays or skillfully adapts Watchman,

60
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.141
first,

61
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:21.220
we need to understand the comic book that serves as its basis at its core.

62
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:25.150
Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons Watchman is a deconstruction of superhero comics.

63
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.090
Comics prior to Watchman were made in the bronze age,

64
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.140
which came directly after and largely mimic the silver age a time when they were

65
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:36.570
at their height of popularity yet were stifled by government regulation during

66
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:38.190
the silver age of the comics code,

67
00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:41.610
censored them so that they had to adhere to strident rules,

68
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.600
advocating that good should always triumph over evil and forbidding any sexual

69
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.750
perversion or excessive violence. The bronze age,

70
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.480
largely replicated many tropes of the silver age though.

71
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.380
It's comics were darker and more Laden with social commentary. However,

72
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:56.400
by the 1980s,

73
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.880
comics were beginning to more meaningfully Belle against these restrictions

74
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.020
giving way to Watchman, which obliterated these rules altogether.

75
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.110
Watchman depicts a world where things aren't black and white,

76
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.790
the so-called heroes are morally conflicted and sometimes downright awful.

77
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.300
Even the villains nefarious plot is all in the name of averting nuclear

78
00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:19.200
Armageddon. Just take it from Alan Moore. I think with things like Watchman,

79
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.440
if they succeed it's because they transcend the superhero genre,

80
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.341
they take it somewhere.

81
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:27.000
It had not been previously been the more hopeless the genre, the better really,

82
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:29.670
because people are going to be more surprised if you do something been good with

83
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:30.150
it.

84
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.860
Zack Snyder's Watchman emerged at a similar period names say comic superhero

85
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:39.150
films had been dominating the pop culture landscape X-Men Spiderman and leader

86
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.590
Ironman ushered in a resurgence of family-friendly superheroes at the multiplex.

87
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.970
These films dominated the box office in turn leading to darker more adult

88
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:49.770
superhero stories like the dark night.

89
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.640
So the time was seemingly perfect for Snyder to obliterate the family-friendly

90
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:56.370
reputation of superhero films and adapt to Watchman,

91
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.410
not as they sat higher up comic books,

92
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.940
but of comic book movies Snyder does so by filling his version of Watchman with

93
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:06.810
graphic violence, most superhero films issue the inherent violence,

94
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.890
their so called heroes because Batman punches folks, senselessly, Ironman,

95
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:14.700
blasts, bad guys with his res. And yet we never saw any of the carnage.

96
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:19.110
These violent acts would naturally because everything is a hundred percent PG

97
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:23.490
13, but in Watchman, we see everything take for instance,

98
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:27.360
the scene we're Dan and Lori are attacked by a gang in an alleyway in the comic.

99
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:30.180
This scene is just Dan and Lori punching a few goons.

100
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.530
We see a few bloodied faces a broken arm, but that's it in Snyder's version.

101
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:35.160
However,

102
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.780
this seems depicted in exacting detail detail that YouTube will probably flag us

103
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:41.730
for showing uncensored, sorry.

104
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.050
One could argue that all this Gore was intentional Snyder commenting on the dark

105
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:49.440
nature of the film said what's popular about the dark night is that it's a

106
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:54.240
superhero movie at its core. When Batman puts on his costume that's bad. Yeah.

107
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.100
Batman go kick some. Watchman is an entirely different experience.

108
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.420
It punishes the audience. It says, Oh, you like the comedian, Oh, he's a rapist.

109
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:03.254
By the way,

110
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.320
I wanted people to think it's going to be a standard superhero movie.

111
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.830
And then they're confronted by all these ideas by showcasing.

112
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.990
<v 2>This violence Snyder draws attention to how comic book films refuse to</v>

113
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:16.600
acknowledge the destruction and darkness implicit.

114
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.200
<v 1>To the idea of vigilantism satirizing superhero films,</v>

115
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.790
just as more did to comics before him. So pretty deep, right?

116
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.680
Well, look,

117
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.130
there's no denying that Zack Snyder is a gifted filmmaker who can stage an

118
00:06:30.131 --> 00:06:31.750
action sequence like no other,

119
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.530
but these intricate fights are significant departure from the graphic novel,

120
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.860
which in comparison is fairly light on action. Yes,

121
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:41.110
of course there are fight scenes scattered throughout the book,

122
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:44.950
but they're always depicted in hyper realistic fashion, quick, brutal,

123
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.190
and over in less than a page or two or three more here,

124
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.540
lampoons the typical long-winded elegantly staged superhero fight by depicting

125
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:56.110
what these fights would actually look like in reality, by contrast,

126
00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:57.820
as you tuber captain Christian notes,

127
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.480
the most vivid depiction of violence comes not from traditional superhero

128
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:04.990
antics, but as a result of Ozymandias is destruction of New York.

129
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.830
More never wanted to glorify watchman's heroes or their antics.

130
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.790
When heroes look back on their past, it's a pathetic form of nostalgia.

131
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.050
The comic even frequently invokes a perfume called nostalgia to drive the point

132
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:21.010
home as such all the present day fight scenes in the comic deliberately don't

133
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:24.610
match the rose-tinted way. The supers view their past heroics.

134
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.020
The best example of this is Hollis Mason's death, more juxtaposes Mason,

135
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:32.470
getting beat to death with the old man flashing back to his glory days,

136
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.520
beating up the baddies and saving the day yet in the present reality,

137
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.930
not a single punch of the elderly Hollis has shown only his fantasies of

138
00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:44.740
youthful violence. However, in Snyder's version of Hollis Mason's death,

139
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.710
the elder crime fighter goes out with a bang landing,

140
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:50.830
a series of punches and dying with a kind of macho dignity.

141
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.850
The fight scene only reinforces Mason's Rose tinted vision of his past.

142
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.910
He really was just as heroic as he thinks he was,

143
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.670
which is the antithesis of what more was saying in the comic,

144
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.970
like giving us a veritable show of bad-assery Snyder.

145
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.150
Doesn't so much as subvert the genre. He reinforces it.

146
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.310
Whereas the comic was anti nostalgia. The film is adamantly pro nostalgia.

147
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.070
When silk Spectre a night owl Don their capes. Again,

148
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.590
it's a moment of triumphant Snyder's version.

149
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.970
They're even hero shots of the two, the comic feature soak spectra night.

150
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:25.360
I will reliving their glory days by having a nerdy discussion about how to

151
00:08:25.361 --> 00:08:28.150
accommodate fire victims by moving a steering column,

152
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.950
the rescue culminates and them serving coffee to their wards by contrast Snyder

153
00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:36.280
has night owl epically shred a water tower with a Gatling gun

154
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.390
while so expect her does a bonafide superhero landing super hero landing.

155
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.070
So you're going to do a super hero landing.

156
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.640
Whereas the comic depicts an impotent nerd needing to play with his gadgets to

157
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:49.540
feel like a man,

158
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.490
the film cures this impotence with actual bad-assery by glorifying these

159
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:55.324
superheroes,

160
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.580
both in the present and past Snider undercuts the moral ambiguity of the

161
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.600
original Watchmen glossing over many of the less desirable traits of the

162
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.030
characters take roar, shack, a character,

163
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:10.110
the anarchist more created to make fun of Steve did CO's iron ran inspired.

164
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:14.370
The question more portrays Worshack is a misanthrope who's obsessed with other

165
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:16.800
people. He reads the new frontiersman,

166
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.300
a far-right paper that supports the KKK echoes Reagan era talking points about

167
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:24.570
welfare Queens called silk Spectre, a bloated aging,

168
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.490
and just generally stands for everything that more personally detests Snyder

169
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.080
keeps a few of these flourishes.

170
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.860
<v 2>The first silk Spectre is a bloated aging.</v>

171
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.940
<v 1>It's mostly to the more appealing nihilistic journal entries.</v>

172
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.410
Even the questionable comments,

173
00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:42.770
roar shack makes are repurposed in Snyder's version. For instance,

174
00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:45.500
in the comics and the movie roar shack speculates.

175
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:47.480
If Ozymandias could be a homosexual,

176
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.170
this was meant to be more of a critique on war shacks obsession with so-called

177
00:09:51.171 --> 00:09:54.170
deviant sex, but in Snyder's version were shacks.

178
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:58.310
Belief is taken as fact Ozymandias is revealed to have a hidden file on his

179
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:00.080
computer labeled boys,

180
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.030
thus roar shacks worldview is given more extra legitimacy instead of the morally

181
00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:06.770
complex weirdo from the comics,

182
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.670
roar shack becomes the voice of reason and the audience surrogate of Snyder's

183
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.210
film. So we're stuck in a bit of a stalemate between deeper dump,

184
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.740
which means only one thing.

185
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.780
<v 2>Watchman may have started.</v>

186
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.440
<v 1>Out as just a Lampoon on the superhero genre, but as more wrote the series,</v>

187
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.780
it began to become something far deeper.

188
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.840
Watchman started off as a silly superhero story.

189
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.410
But what I eventually came to the conclusion of about Watchman was the most

190
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:34.010
important thing in it, was it structured. And I think at the end,

191
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:36.290
that Watchman structure was what it was about.

192
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.080
It was about a certain way of viewing reality.

193
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.970
It was about a kind of perception,

194
00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:44.510
which I think was perhaps not as prominent in 1985 as it is now.

195
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.520
And as I think it will be in the near future,

196
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.630
it's not a linear perception of things that we do increasingly have in the 21st

197
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:53.990
century, see more wanted to challenge reader's perception.

198
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.490
He believed in a post relativity slash Einstein world time could no longer be

199
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.410
considered a linear construct.

200
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.540
How we perceive the world was inherently incomplete events don't occur linearly,

201
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.590
but are happening simultaneously through the structure of Watchman and in

202
00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:10.730
particular through Dr.

203
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.410
Manhattan and Ozymandias more sought to prove this point just as Dr. Manhattan

204
00:11:15.411 --> 00:11:16.244
views time,

205
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.090
non-linearly the comic is structured so that the past present and future are

206
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:21.680
constantly blurring together.

207
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.460
We tried to make Watchman structured that images recur all the way through

208
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.600
linking the present with the past and the future giving foreshadowings of things

209
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:32.810
that have yet to come giving echoes of things that have already happened.

210
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.820
And later on the comic Ozymandias watches events unfurl on multiple television

211
00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:40.880
screens mirroring how a person would read the comic itself.

212
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.580
Adrian Vite is watching six channels at once.

213
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:48.500
And so at various points in Watchman are the readers it's multichannel viewing

214
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.440
by exposing readers to a non-linear comic book,

215
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:55.780
more sought to challenge how readers perceive their own reality. Similarly,

216
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.430
Snyder uses his version of Watchman to comment on the same, except for Snyder.

217
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.510
Isn't interested in how time and space shape perceptions of reality. Instead,

218
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:08.230
the filmmakers zeroes in on how pop culture and media have warped people's

219
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:11.740
perceptions with their comic Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons were saying,

220
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.690
superheroes are kind of funky aren't they,

221
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.440
we build upon that with a movie that acknowledges that superhero movies have

222
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:20.020
affected pop culture to prove this point,

223
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.750
Snyder fills Watchman with touchstones, from pop culture,

224
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:26.620
with one crucial addition superheroes by doing so Snyder.

225
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.580
Lateralizes the impact of comic book films on viewers showing how the emergence

226
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:31.720
of superheroes changes,

227
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:36.100
familiar moments in pop culture that we all know and remember Watchman almost

228
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.260
super imposes its heroes on your world,

229
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.170
which then changes how you view your world through its prison.

230
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.500
That's the genius of this book. That's what we try and do in the movie.

231
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.340
The movie is a challenge, sort of like the book is a challenge to your icons,

232
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:51.880
your morality, how you perceive pop culture, how you perceive mythology.

233
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:54.070
And for that matter, how you perceive God,

234
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.150
everything in Watchman is filtered through pop culture, even history itself.

235
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.550
When Dr. Manhattan fights in the Vietnam war.

236
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:03.810
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

237
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.140
<v 1>That recreates this historical moment through the prism of the most famous</v>

238
00:13:07.141 --> 00:13:09.420
Vietnam war movie ever made apocalypse.

239
00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:11.790
Now using the same music cue from Coppola's.

240
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.190
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

241
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.420
<v 1>Later Snyder uses his soundtrack choices to reference the art film Koyaanisqatsi</v>

242
00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:22.350
life out of balance

243
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.490
That non-narrative film juxtaposes,

244
00:13:29.491 --> 00:13:32.190
beautiful scenes of nature with the chaos of modern life,

245
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.820
and to have choice for a man who left earth because of the mayhem of humanity.

246
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:39.750
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

247
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.870
<v 1>Even the war room Richard Nixon and his generals use is modeled.</v>

248
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:44.010
After a famous film.

249
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.620
<v 3>You can find in here, this is the war room.</v>

250
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.120
<v 1>All these examples expose how we perceive and filter the world through media and</v>

251
00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:51.990
pop culture.

252
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.070
It's not just a meadow wink that Hollis Mason has a copy of Moore's Watchmen on

253
00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:59.070
his shelf. It's yet another example of how pop culture,

254
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.390
a comic book like Watchman influenced and shaped Snyders. And by proxy,

255
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.460
our perception of the world,

256
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.840
this theme culminates with Ozymandias watching dozens of TV screens allow the

257
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:12.930
comic book, but unlike Moore's original intent,

258
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.250
Ozymandias watching these screens mirroring how viewers read the comic Snyder

259
00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:21.180
instead uses this moment to play on how reality is warped by pop culture,

260
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.770
all the images on the screen,

261
00:14:22.771 --> 00:14:26.490
reference different films and programs that influence and shape Zack Snyder.

262
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:29.520
The filmmaker there's road, warrior Looney tunes.

263
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.400
The day the earth stood still fail safe and more.

264
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.360
So what are we to make of Snyder's Watchman as the filmmaker betrayed

265
00:14:36.361 --> 00:14:36.840
everything.

266
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.100
Alan Moore's comics stood for glorifying its heroes and compromising the moral

267
00:14:41.101 --> 00:14:42.480
ambiguity of Moore's work,

268
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.070
or has Snyder skillfully adapted Watchman for our pop culture saturated time.

269
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.060
Ultimately, it all depends on your perception. If you view Watchman,

270
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.260
the lens of Moore's original intent, then watchman's pretty dumb.

271
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.590
But if you view the film through Snyder signature style envision,

272
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.500
then the film could be considered deep. Even after all this,

273
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:03.980
we're still pretty split on the merits of this movie, but for what it's worth,

274
00:15:03.981 --> 00:15:05.960
I tend to lean toward the deep side.

275
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.390
Whereas many of our writers lean towards dumb,

276
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.790
but honestly I can see both sides.

277
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.790
So what do you think is Watchman deep or dumb?

278
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.070
Has your perception of the film changed at all?
