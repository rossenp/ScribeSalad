<v 0>This video is brought to you by net ease games.</v>

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.040
Hey wisecrack, Dr. Chris here and today,

3
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:13.580
we're talking about a kid's cartoon that still haunts our grown-up nightmares.

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.490
Courage. The cowardly dog. This show is weird.

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.830
<v 1>Between.</v>

6
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.210
<v 0>Its empty isolated setting.</v>

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.090
It's bizarre plot lines and it's unsettling animation style.

8
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:25.070
The show is just off route.

9
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.830
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.740
<v 0>And because of that, it terrified a generation of young viewers,</v>

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.810
but wasn't creepy just for creepiness sake.

12
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.023
<v 1>No.</v>

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.420
<v 0>Wait, because while it was busy, thoroughly freaking us out,</v>

14
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.370
it was also doing something else showing us how fear could save or

15
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:53.204
ruin us.

16
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.200
<v 0>Explain in this wisecrack edition on courage, the cowardly dog,</v>

18
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.700
while courage may show us how fear shapes us. There's plenty of other movies,

19
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:08.510
TV shows, and even games that show us. We need to be fearless to survive.

20
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.260
Today's sponsor life after is just one example.

21
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.000

and thanks to net EAs games for sponsoring this video.

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.350
We interrupt this program.

37
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.463
<v 1>Cowardly.</v>

38
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.100
<v 0>For a quick recap, courage, the cowardly dog as well,</v>

39
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.190
a fearful canine living in the middle of nowhere, Kansas,

40
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.750
with a kindly old Scottish lady Muriel and her cranky husband Eustace at this

41
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:25.310
plot line seems a bit prosaic.

42
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.390
The show itself is anything but courage is adventurous are not the wholesome

43
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:33.800
games of SpongeBob or the whimsically imaginative adventures of the Rugrats.

44
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.400
The reason for his distinctiveness is simple courage. The cowardly dog,

45
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.540
more than any other cartoon we can think of clearly went to great lengths to

46
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:45.470
scare the hell out of its young audience, whether it was parodying, hardcore,

47
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:49.040
horror, flicks, like the Exorcist or inventing its very own terrorists.

48
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.740
Like the vengeful three, headed chicken from outer space.

49
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.340
It really pulled out all the stops to ensure it gave us a childhood frightened.

50
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.130
<v 1>And the it resonated so.</v>

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.410
<v 0>Well has everything to do with the protagonists.</v>

52
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.540
See courage himself makes for an oddly perfect avatar for the psychology of a

53
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.820
child as a little purplish pink dog.

54
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.120
He's physically dwarfed by the world around him and only has a limited

55
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:16.240
understanding of it. Making much of it appear quite frightening,

56
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.020
just happens to be the same exact reason why small children are so easily

57
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:20.770
scared.

58
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.520
They're underdeveloped brains and limited pool of past experience to draw from,

59
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.280
make it impossible for them to accurately assess the threat,

60
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.330
which outside stimuli posts as a result, perfectly harmless.

61
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.720
Things might appear terrifying. Also like a young child,

62
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.140
courage has a restricted ability to communicate his fears.

63
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.490
Use this perpetually writes his screams of tear off as the panic reactions of

64
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.670
the dog while Muriel is much more compassionate.

65
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.570
She is similarly unable to understand what has him so spooked.

66
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.110
So he's left alone to deal with fears,

67
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:57.070
which no one else seems to understand like a young child who can't comprehend,

68
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.440
why his parents insist on sending him to bed.

69
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.080
When there are clearly monsters under there.

70
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.760
<v 1>[Inaudible] in the attic.</v>

71
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.900
He shaped happy to me.

72
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.710
<v 0>Understanding courage as an avatar for a young child becomes a sort of</v>

73
00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:20.250
heartbreaking exercise. When you consider the poor puffs early years,

74
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.210
they were marked by the severe trauma of watching his parents launched into

75
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:26.220
space by a deranged veterinarian.

76
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.540
And while this is a typically absurd plot detail for our cartoon network show,

77
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.010
it also acts as a weirdly effective analogy for childhood trauma witnessing

78
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:38.430
their loved ones in danger, from a crazy vet or whatever else,

79
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.130
fundamentally shatters a child's sense of safety.

80
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.000
The aftereffects of such a huge shock to their developing psyche can linger for

81
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.220
a long time. As a result of his trauma,

82
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.360
courage now lives in a heightened state anxiously expecting the worst at every

83
00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:55.500
turn in particular, he has developed a clear case of separation,

84
00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:56.820
anxiety panicking.

85
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.530
Every time Muriel leaves his site and constantly worrying about her safety as is

86
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:04.020
common for children who experienced loss at a young age.

87
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.380
He now lives in fear of his other loved ones. Leaving.

88
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.213
<v 1>As well.</v>

89
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.820
<v 0>Episodes begin with him freaking out about a danger that no one else has</v>

90
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:25.740
bothered by. But importantly he is sometimes incredibly wrong. In the episode.

91
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.780
Heads of beef courage is convinced that the new burger joint in town is secretly

92
00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:34.590
killing off its customers to use them as meat Sweeney, Todd style,

93
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.000
after thoroughly freaking out and knocking the owner unconscious in his bed to

94
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:43.050
rescue use this courage discovers that he was wrong all along his mind has been

95
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:47.070
so molded by his early experiences that he lives in a constant state of terror,

96
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.380
which can cause him to panic unnecessarily.

97
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.390
<v 1>That sure is one good looking statue where you can we eat it. However.</v>

98
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.030
<v 0>Because he lives in a place riddled with aliens,</v>

99
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.910
giant insects and the like courages initial fears tend to be pretty well founded

100
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.360
more often than not. In fact, thanks to his hyper alert nature.

101
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.560
He's actually frequently able to save the day while used to send Muriel,

102
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:13.220
continually walk blindly into all kinds of danger, courage, spies,

103
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.020
the threat early enough to take action.

104
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.260
The two parts of his name are what makes him the show's hero.

105
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.590
He is cowardly enough to feel threatened by all the crazy stuff.

106
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.100
Life throws at him, but he has the courage to power through it,

107
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.090
to protect the people he cares about things I do for love.

108
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.980
This is important in making courages, neurosis, not only well-founded,

109
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.970
but actively lifesaving. The show tells us something about fear itself,

110
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.460
namely that the emotion isn't a weakness,

111
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.230
rather it's a natural and necessary part of life. Key to keeping us safe.

112
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.430
This is underscored by the introduction of a recurrent character known simply as

113
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.533
the computer,

114
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.460
a well-spoken AI who lives inside courageous computer and who like an awful

115
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:57.470
lot of people is kind of a jerk to him.

116
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.320
<v 1>You're such a lousy typist.</v>

117
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.460
<v 0>In particular, the computer seems to take issue with the whole idea of fear.</v>

118
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.760
He prides himself on being a cold calculating machine.

119
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.540
When a freak storm allows him to take control over Muriel's body.

120
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.670
He uses it to perform a series of death,

121
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:16.700
defying stunts to show just how unafraid he is,

122
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.770
but being fearless isn't necessarily a strength.

123
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.070
It might just mean you don't value anything or anyone enough to worry about them

124
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:22.904
being harmed.

125
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.180
<v 1>When it's not like I'm scared or anything.</v>

126
00:07:25.181 --> 00:07:28.030
It's just that if there's an electrical surge,

127
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.720
I could crash get Y Zippo.

128
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.580
<v 0>Again, it's courage is overwhelming concern for the safety of those around him,</v>

129
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.650
which regularly inspires him to save the day.

130
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.400
But while fear can be helpful or even fun in the right context,

131
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.900
it can also ruin people while courage has basically internalized his trauma.

132
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.070
Many of the shows,

133
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.310
buildings reveal what can happen when inner pain is expressed.

134
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.170
Outwardly episodes, the tower of doctors, a lost and the shadow of courage,

135
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.640
both feature characters who break bad as a result of their own suffering in the

136
00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:04.750
first doctor is a loss is a mad scientist who is so deeply depressed,

137
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.730
that he launches a barrage of emotion,

138
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.960
altering cannon balls to make everyone as unhappy as he is in the latter

139
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:11.680
episode,

140
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.850
the shadow takes the terrorizing courage and his family only stopping when

141
00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:19.270
courage finally manages to connect with him emotionally and convince him to

142
00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:22.540
follow his dreams rather than ruining other people's lives.

143
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.100
<v 1>I dunno how to make it in show biz, but there are the real stars.</v>

144
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.570
Why don't we hang with them? You meet become the shadow of a real star.

145
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.553
It's worth a trial.

146
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.190
<v 0>These episodes offer a far more complicated idea of evil.</v>

147
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.290
They suggest that much of the time,

148
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.740
the people who scare us the most are the ones most wrapped up in their own

149
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:46.600
fears. The lesson, if we let it overwhelm us, fear makes monsters of us all.

150
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.690
<v 2>What's the good of having all the money in the world.</v>

151
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.020
If it doesn't bring in their happiness and then five not happy,

152
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.250
no one deserves to be happy. And if you think we're.

153
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.000
<v 0>Reading too much into this terrifying children's show, guess what? The creator,</v>

154
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.260
John R Dilworth agrees with us saying I don't portray psychopaths.

155
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.340
Those don't interest me.

156
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.790
I'm very much interested in the repressed traumas of villains.

157
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.380
The idea of going deeper,

158
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.880
trying to assign an etymology of bad behavior to childhood trauma is based on

159
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:18.090
actual science. That's the science of psychiatry.

160
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.880
Nowhere is this more true than with Eustace?

161
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.730
The most constant source of fear encourages life,

162
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.790
a grumpy old man who never has a kind word to say,

163
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.530
and mostly seems to exist only to abuse. The other members of his household use.

164
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:34.620
This would have been tragically familiar for too many young viewers,

165
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.650
but we learn more about his past childhood throughout the show.

166
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:41.520
And it turns out that his own hostility is rooted in the treatment he received

167
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:42.354
as a child.

168
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.230
The way he treats courage is just a replication of the way his own mother

169
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.064
treated him.

170
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.330
<v 1>Stupid boy, stupid dog.</v>

171
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.740
<v 0>You rating him constantly and favoring his older brother all to ensure that he</v>

172
00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:58.040
lived in constant fear of not measuring up. See.

173
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.650
<v 1>Elated use lists.</v>

174
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.040
<v 0>And while it's heavy stuff for creepy kids, cartoon,</v>

175
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.870
it's also sadly true to life.

176
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.220
Many adults carry their own childhood abuse with them inflicting the fear that

177
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:14.240
they felt onto others, rather than learning to process it in a healthy way,

178
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.800
stope a dog.

179
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.910
But while courage extends a lot of sympathy to many of its more monstrous

180
00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:20.690
characters,

181
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.170
it also has a pretty empowering central message that it's important to take

182
00:10:24.171 --> 00:10:26.840
action in the face of those who make us feel unsafe,

183
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.810
even if it can be a really scary thing to do. And one of the series,

184
00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:32.120
most infamous episodes freaky. Fred,

185
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.380
the family is visited by a relative named Fred who narrates his actions with a

186
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:37.700
rhyming inner monologue.

187
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.170
<v 1>That's when my tired eyes beheld, doggy dog like dog,</v>

188
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.560
he spelled D O G is what he spelled.

189
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.820
And that's how I spell no shorty.

190
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.080
<v 0>And compulsively shaves people's hair off because it makes them feel naughty</v>

191
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.070
because Muriel and Eustis ignore courages protests about their creeping new

192
00:10:58.071 --> 00:10:58.341
house.

193
00:10:58.341 --> 00:11:02.360
Guests thread is able to trap courage in the bathroom and forcibly shave him.

194
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.370
Fred is one of the many figures from courage who lingers with viewers years

195
00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:07.910
later,

196
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.630
even if they struggle to put a finger on exactly what made him so unsettling.

197
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.450
<v 1>Hello friend, my name is Fred.</v>

198
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.130
The words you hear are in my head, I say, I said,

199
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.830
my name is Fred, and I've been

200
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.740
naughty.

201
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:25.880
<v 0>Back though.</v>

202
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.780
The tail is basically a cartoon network friendly story about a child predator.

203
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.160
Fred is terrorizing courage in his own home while other family members refuse to

204
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:37.430
acknowledge that this creepy compulsive Rhymer is dangerous.

205
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.260
Despite our protagonist warnings,

206
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.230
fear has an ability to make us feel unworthy or cowardly.

207
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.780
This is something many abusers prey on the courage.

208
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:48.470
His fears are valid and he deserves to have them taken seriously. Fortunately,

209
00:11:48.471 --> 00:11:52.370
he eventually realizes this and makes a call to Fred's mental institution.

210
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.240
The villain is promptly carted away. The episode,

211
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:59.650
the mask widely regarded as one of the show's best returns to this idea of how

212
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.490
immobilizing fear can be with a tale about a couple of friends named kitty.

213
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.950
<v 3>And bunny. I was forced to leave my home and my best friend.</v>

214
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.950
<v 0>Some have argued that it's a thinly veiled allegory for a same-sex couple bunny</v>

215
00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:17.640
has been forbidden from seeing kitty and is being held captive by her vicious

216
00:12:17.641 --> 00:12:19.440
partner, Madoff kitty.

217
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.790
Now wearing the titular mask has come to believe that all canines are evil and

218
00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:24.630
attacks courage.

219
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.860
Every time they meet while kitty lashes out in the same way that Eustace doctors

220
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.370
are lost.

221
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.540
And so many others do Bunny's fear pushes her to accept the abusive treatment

222
00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:34.890
she receives from her boyfriend,

223
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.530
convinced that she deserves nothing better than again,

224
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.360
wrapping heavy subjects like domestic abuse and homophobia up in its colorful

225
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.470
cartoon language.

226
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.210
The show gets at how easy it is for us to be made afraid of who you really are

227
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.930
to feel like we need to hide ourselves. No matter the cost of happiness,

228
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.080
watching kitty and money write-off triumphantly after courage,

229
00:12:55.081 --> 00:12:56.610
rescues them is a bright,

230
00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:59.780
brilliant way to tell a young audience that this simply isn't.

231
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.290
<v 3>True [inaudible].</v>

232
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.950
<v 0>While courage is attention is typically drawn towards the monster of the week.</v>

233
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:12.660
Deep down he shares bunny, same ultimate fear, not being good enough courage,

234
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.950
clings to Muriel because she is the one person left who reaffirms his sense that

235
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:17.784
he has value.

236
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.440
And yet he puts up with Eustace is abuse because on some level he doesn't

237
00:13:22.441 --> 00:13:25.800
entirely believe it. That nagging voice we all have on some level.

238
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.240
The one that insists that we aren't good enough is even given physical shape in

239
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:33.300
the series finale. Perfect. The episode season,

240
00:13:33.301 --> 00:13:35.760
old school teacher dub the perfectionist,

241
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.660
demanding that courage prove his worth by performing a never ending series of

242
00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:42.930
tasks up to her impossible standards. The more he struggles,

243
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.130
the more she berates him,

244
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.480
steadily grinding away at his confidence and adding to his anxiety.

245
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.000
By the time she ordered him to sleep perfectly,

246
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.160
which prevents him from actually sleeping at all.

247
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.690
He's pretty much losing his mind.

248
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.310
That is until a friendly green fish in his bathtub offers some Sage advice to

249
00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:02.070
stop aiming for perfection and embrace who he is.

250
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.730
<v 3>With all your imperfections you can do.</v>

251
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.161
<v 0>And just like that,</v>

252
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:11.850
he is able to vanquish the nagging voice of the perfectionist and the fear that

253
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.684
she feeds on.

254
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.100
And so one of the weirdest darkest most soul rattling shows that the cartoon

255
00:14:17.101 --> 00:14:20.130
network ever aired comes to a genuinely heartwarming conclusion.

256
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.820
<v 3>There's no such thing as perfect.</v>

257
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.140
You'll beautiful as you are.

258
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.470
<v 0>Courage was able to get inside our heads when we were kids,</v>

259
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.820
because as disturbing as it might be to admit it really spoke our language.

260
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.780
And one of the reasons it continues to resonate is that it isn't just invested

261
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:41.070
in scaring its viewers.

262
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.270
It also wants to teach us about what it means to be scared that our fears

263
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:47.130
matter, even if others dismiss them,

264
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.500
that we can overcome the things we're scared of.

265
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.160
And ultimately that there was no in being afraid.

266
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.730
So what do you think wise crack is courage, the cowardly dog in all,

267
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:59.540
its weirdness a wonderful exploration of childhood fear. And is that why?

268
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:03.200
