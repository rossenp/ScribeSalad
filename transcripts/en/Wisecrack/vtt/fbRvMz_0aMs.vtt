1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:04.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.480
<v 1>Wisecrack Michael here. It feels like every time a TV show ends.</v>

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.920
There's one thing you can always count on. Disappointed fans,

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.490
things have gotten so bad that when game of Thrones ended angry,

5
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:18.050
fans flooded the internet,

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.520
creating a petition for the final season to be rewritten by competent writers.

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.290
This pattern constantly repeats a show is lauded as one of the greats of all

8
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:30.260
time until that pesky finale,

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.180
just look at what happened with last praised as the pinnacle of modern TV drama

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.590
until the very last episode, then the fandom went scorched earth,

11
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.371
admonishing,

12
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:44.570
the showrunners for lying and copying out with their twist ending even a series

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.200
as beloved, as breaking bad concluded to divisive reactions.

14
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.250
Some say the show should have ended two episodes earlier with the watermark

15
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.180
episode Ozymandias, the list of shows with disappointing endings.

16
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.420
It's seemingly limitless, but this got us thinking,

17
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.600
why is it so hard for TV shows to stick the landing?

18
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.750
Is there a foolproof way to do so that will please everyone,

19
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:09.110
or are TV finales inherently doomed to this fleece?

20
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.800
Let's find out in this wisecrack condition on how to ruin a TV finale.

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.740
<v 0>Spoilers for a whole bunch of shows.</v>

22
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.730
<v 1>So what makes a great or terrible finale anyway,</v>

23
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.900
it's not quite as simple as just comparing and contrasting the supposedly good

24
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:28.070
finales with the supposedly terrible ones. Every show is inherently different.

25
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.850
If Schitt's Creek ended with a dragon raining hell fire on its town,

26
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.990
I'll like game of Thrones.

27
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.310
That would be both nonsensical and also kind of awesome. However,

28
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.510
there is one constant that every show shares, no matter the genre,

29
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.310
us, the viewers,

30
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.120
the relationship between viewers and their TVs was once considered to be fairly

31
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:51.290
one-sided with viewers, mindlessly consuming, whatever was playing on screen,

32
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.850
but in the 1970s, sociologist, Elihu Katz redefined that relationship,

33
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.500
describing it as an active one,

34
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:01.130
whereby viewers choose what to watch in order to satisfy their own personal

35
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:02.900
needs. Based on this work,

36
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.800
psychologists began to study the bond that develops between a viewer and a TV

37
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:10.820
series and discovered it's not too different for real life relationships.

38
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.160
That makes sense just as we cry,

39
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.620
when something happens to a loved one in the meat world,

40
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.190
we cry when something terrible happens to a beloved fictional character on

41
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:20.024
screen,

42
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.820
this intense relationship between a viewer and a television show is called a

43
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.990
parasocial relationship. A phenomenon. We talk about a little in a recent video.

44
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.200
A parasocial relationship is a one-sided bond.

45
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.940
You might have with a celebrity or fictional character or sweaty YouTube post,

46
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.840
but finales are interesting, not because of our parasocial relationship,

47
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.110
but the way we could view them as a Tara social breakup,

48
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.120
when watching a TV series, we,

49
00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:51.110
the viewers project ourselves into the lives of Ross, Rachel Dexter,

50
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:52.370
Tony and Walter White.

51
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.480
We get to know these characters deeply as if they were our own friends,

52
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.580
even though they will never know us or forget to Venmo is $7 for tacos,

53
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.270
Brandon, and after spending hours upon hours,

54
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.570
watching these characters and talking about them, it's only natural.

55
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.610
We become emotionally attached.

56
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.150
These fictional characters and series become a bedrock in our lives,

57
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.010
which only makes it harder when inevitably they end just like a real breakup.

58
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.860
The end of a TV series can evoke a flurry of emotion.

59
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.790
Of course not all breakups are the same.

60
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.650
Sometimes you calmly accept the lie that it wasn't your fault or come to

61
00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:29.131
resent.

62
00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:33.390
The idea that you're grateful dead fandom is a turnoff put the most emotionally

63
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:38.160
healthy breakups usually have something in common closure relationships.

64
00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:42.360
This closure somewhat self-evidently comes from understanding the reason why the

65
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:45.990
relationship ended. Was it another person? Have we just grown apart?

66
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.560
Was it something I said, almost certainly in these moments,

67
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:53.430
we're just looking for an answer to latch onto to explain this sudden change in

68
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:57.420
our personal lives. But when deprived of a concrete answer, it can cause me,

69
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.440
I mean, anyone to start spinning out. Similarly,

70
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:04.320
audiences yearn for closure from television series,

71
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.880
we seek to understand why a series is ending just as we would try to understand

72
00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.650
why a significant other is ghosting us.

73
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.920
Even after we go to medical school in hopes that we become their primary care

74
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:17.520
physician, just so we can know that they're alive. Samantha,

75
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.120
this is one of the reasons why shows that are abruptly canceled,

76
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:23.340
inspires such vitriol from audiences.

77
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.780
They feel like the closure that was owed to them has been taken away after the

78
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:30.930
TV series. Jericho was abruptly canceled on a cliffhanger.

79
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.090
Viewers sent thousands of peanuts and protests demanding to see the full story

80
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:39.930
played to its conclusion, which okay, weird, but good bit.

81
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.420
This need for closure extends the series.

82
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.450
Finales shows that end on an ambiguous note,

83
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.240
tend to find a much more divisive reaction. That series,

84
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:50.310
that wrap things up in a conclusive manner.

85
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.980
Look no further than the finale of the Sopranos.

86
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.330
One of the most hotly debated endings of all time as Tony sits with his family

87
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:00.000
and joined some greasy onion rings, he looks up and

88
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.150
fans weren't sure if this abrupt cut to black meant that Tony had been whacked,

89
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.230
or if their cable just gone out as such many were disappointed with the finale

90
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:14.430
due to this lack of closure at the time of the finales Erin angry fans,

91
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:19.110
yet again flooded the HBO website, demanding answers, no peanuts though.

92
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.580
Some reviewers even said the ending ruined the series as a whole,

93
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.800
while it divided audiences at the time,

94
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.760
it contemporary opinions about the episode seem to have become less vitriolic.

95
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.270
Similar tensions existed in the finales of breaking bad and mad men.

96
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.740
Both of which also ended on a somewhat ambiguous note for its protagonist.

97
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.360
Did Walter White succumb to his gunshot has Don really turned a corner and found

98
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.350
peace and enlightenment, or really fall back into the same huckster lifestyle.

99
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.160
Yet again,

100
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.540
both series deliberately leave these questions open-ended and deprive audiences

101
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:54.420
of the closure they so desperately want. And yet again,

102
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.770
a lot of people were in contrast,

103
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:00.800
if you look at the highest rated TV finales of all time,

104
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.910
one series consistently appears on every list, six feet under,

105
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.940
whereas the Sopranos and mad men divided viewers,

106
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.830
the six feet under finale was universally embraced with nary of peanut insight.

107
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.980
In fact, it's hard to find a single negative reaction to it,

108
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.510
even on the rapidly over opinionated internet, unlike the Sopranos,

109
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.440
the finale of six feet under provides total closure ending with a montage that

110
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.990
reveals the futures of all its main characters.

111
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.210
These final moments are structured so that you,

112
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.660
the viewer can cathartic fully say goodbye to each character.

113
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.530
We omnisciently see how each of their lives play out, who they'll marry.

114
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.120
The children they'll have. And yes, how they'll eventually die. One by one,

115
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:45.560
the familiar six feet under plaque comes up as they pass on allowing total

116
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:48.980
closure for the series and for the audience's relationship with these

117
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:52.040
characters, just as Claire drives off from her family,

118
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.720
moving away into the unknown,

119
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.800
we to bid farewell to the show and move on with our own lives.

120
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.640
Aside from closure. Another problem, plagues finales,

121
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.170
the twist ending.

122
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.830
This is kind of strange because in movies we love a good twist.

123
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.740
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

124
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.690
<v 1>But to see why this doesn't work in TV,</v>

125
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:16.900
let's return to the parasocial relationship with movies.

126
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.230
Audiences don't have the same time investment that they would with a television

127
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:23.170
series. A movie is only two or so hours of our lives.

128
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.740
Whereas we can build our one-way relationship with characters like Jim and Pam

129
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:28.210
over several years.

130
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.470
If we learn that the good guy we've known for 90 minutes is actually the bad

131
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:33.640
guy. It's no sweat,

132
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:38.170
but in TV it can feel like you've just been catfished by a Nigerian man calling

133
00:07:38.171 --> 00:07:39.280
himself Williams.

134
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.930
<v 2>I don't know about this.</v>

135
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.510
<v 1>After spending so much time with a series,</v>

136
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:45.730
this kind of sudden twist is unsettling.

137
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.930
It should be no surprise then that the most poorly received finales all tend to

138
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:52.360
have an out of left field twist case.

139
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:55.390
In point Denaris target Aryan for seven seasons.

140
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.220
Denaris was the mother of dragons that heroic breaker of chains who the audience

141
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.630
cheered and rooted for yet in the final season of game of Thrones is turned into

142
00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:09.070
a homicidal maniac out of the blue and started burning innocence of billions

143
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.900
alive. She suddenly,

144
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.040
without proper explanation became a completely different person than the

145
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:17.950
character we had invested in for seven plus years.

146
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.310
Understandably audiences rejected the twist.

147
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.870
This is also true for the finales of Dexter and lost on Dexter.

148
00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:29.620
The titular character attempts to balance being a forensic investigator by day

149
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:33.730
and a successful serial killer by night, over the course of eight seasons,

150
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:34.510
Dexter crafts,

151
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.560
a meticulous domestic facade fooling his workmates and family into thinking.

152
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.610
He's just like them all the while indulging in his homicidal impulses.

153
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.630
<v 2>I need you to put it on that time. I see it right away. I'm kinda in the middle.</v>

154
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.480
<v 1>But a funny thing happened over the course of the series.</v>

155
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.950
The domestic facade that Dexter creates ultimately becomes his reality as he

156
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:57.780
gets married and has a son faced with the prospect of raising a child,

157
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.260
Dexter begins to try to quell his darker inclinations and becomes,

158
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.330
dare we say more empathetic.

159
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.410
<v 3>But I was wrong. There is something I truly believe</v>

160
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.820
everything's better after a bubble bath.

161
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.980
<v 1>Well, he's still kills a whole bunch of people,</v>

162
00:09:12.981 --> 00:09:16.520
but at least he begins to question if this was really the right thing to do,

163
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.910
which only made it all the more random when the series ended,

164
00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:23.390
not with Dexter on the run or behind bars or hanging up with scalpels,

165
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.560
but at some random lumberjack in the Midwest, and to add insult to injury,

166
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.270
he's abandoned his own son,

167
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.070
negating years worth of character growth in the process like Denaris Dexter

168
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:36.590
suddenly becomes a completely different person,

169
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.820
ironically for a show entirely about a man reconciling his identity.

170
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.760
We were left. Wondering if we ever knew him at all,

171
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.990
as for lost the finale twist. Wasn't so much of a trail of the characters,

172
00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:50.240
but of the series as a whole,

173
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.290
for six seasons audiences debated and argued over loss, various mysteries,

174
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.590
who was the smoke monster. What's the deal with that for towed statue?

175
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.520
How can the Island heal a paraplegic? And most importantly,

176
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.010
what and where the hell is this Island?

177
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.533
<v 3>Gosh.</v>

178
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.950
<v 1>One theory kept popping up over and over again in the early seasons that all the</v>

179
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:16.610
castaways that actually died in the inciting plane crash and that the Island

180
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:18.470
itself was their purgatory.

181
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.000
This theory became so popular that show co-creator JJ Abrams had to come out and

182
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.750
denounce it early in the show's run. And in 2006 interview,

183
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.860
after the first season had aired Abrams explained that the purgatory theory is a

184
00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:33.740
great one. I love that theory, but it isn't what it is.

185
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.410
I'd be frustrated if that were the answer I have to say,

186
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.450
but reception to the finale was marred and confusion was the Island purgatory,

187
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.680
basically purgatory parallel universe or D none of the above.

188
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.850
What the hell is happening.

189
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.170
The writers basically sidestepped the questions with Carlton Q saying that we

190
00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:53.390
felt like lost was sort of the big bang theory.

191
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.510
And every question would only beget another question.

192
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.550
One common interpretation that the parallel universe is flashbacks simply took

193
00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:05.600
place in the character's heads would mean that many events depicted in the final

194
00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:10.190
season didn't matter or reveal which betrays a fundamental aspect of what makes

195
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:14.510
a good finale that everything we've previously watched needs to have mattered.

196
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.990
Ironically, Damon Lindelof might agree with the sentiment.

197
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.960
He Sates cheers as the perfect TV series finale,

198
00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:24.950
because it's so definitively showed that everything we had watched mattered to

199
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.980
quote Lindelof. When Sam switches off the lights at the end of cheers,

200
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.110
you're basically like these going to be a bartender.

201
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.320
He's going to have more girlfriends. He's going to have further adventures,

202
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.500
but they're not as interesting as everything else that you just showed me.

203
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.630
You showed me the most important part.

204
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.270
<v 3>I'm the luckiest son of a on her.</v>

205
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.960
<v 1>However, a series that undermine their own internal logic. Aren't,</v>

206
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.130
well-received just as lost undercut its final season with a big twist.

207
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.860
Roseanne did the same revealing that the final season was a fantasy Roseanne's

208
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:56.050
head concocted to cope with her husband's.

209
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.850
<v 3>I lost Dan last year when he had his heart attack.</v>

210
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.560
<v 1>Fans hated this finale so much that when Roseanne was revived in 2018,</v>

211
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.380
the show just pretended it never happened. Similarly,

212
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.850
the finale of St elsewhere,

213
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.300
infamously ended with the reveal that the entire series took place in the

214
00:12:12.301 --> 00:12:17.280
imagination of a boy with autism to say audiences were displeased would be an

215
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.230
understatement. In both cases,

216
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.310
the series went against the central tenant of good television that everything

217
00:12:23.311 --> 00:12:27.150
we've watched matters. So how can you make audiences happy?

218
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.740
It's actually pretty simple by looking back to the good times,

219
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.980
the most revered finales don't focus on the end at all.

220
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.320
Instead they harken back to the beginning,

221
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.920
reminding the audience of the parasocial relationship they developed with the

222
00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:42.210
series at the start.

223
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.840
This is why so many finales are filled with constant callbacks.

224
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.240
Look no further than the good place.

225
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.380
It's finale is stuffed with references to its early years from Chidi teaching

226
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.160
ethics lessons,

227
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.370
just like he had with Eleanor to the gang returning to their original,

228
00:12:56.371 --> 00:13:00.510
good place neighborhood to Jason's obsession with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

229
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.643
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

230
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.001
<v 1>Similarly,</v>

231
00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:10.500
the Veep finale was filled with Easter eggs even ends with a call back to its

232
00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:14.850
very first episode. When Selena uses the R word on camera,

233
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.930
prompting her team to do disaster control Selena's press secretary suggest they

234
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:22.830
hold off on making a public apology and wait for a bigger story to get

235
00:13:22.831 --> 00:13:24.630
everyone's attention. Let's not make it.

236
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.030
<v 3>It's a story and panic. Okay. What if Tom Hanks dies?</v>

237
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.000
<v 1>And how does the final season of Veep end with Salinas funeral being</v>

238
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.540
overshadowed by yes. The death of Meg Ryan's favorite loving.

239
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.970
<v 4>Breaking news. I've just been told that four time Academy award winning actor,</v>

240
00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:43.710
Tom Hanks has died.

241
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.060
<v 1>Or trying to get fans the same dopamine high they got when they first fell in</v>

242
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:51.990
love with the characters just as we replay the good times of a relationship in

243
00:13:51.991 --> 00:13:52.530
our head,

244
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:57.300
the best TV finales tap into the same emotional need breaking up naturally

245
00:13:57.301 --> 00:13:58.770
feels pretty terrible.

246
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.450
So why even dwell in these negative feelings instead just focus on the

247
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:07.350
positive when things were great in the future seem limitless and Samantha was

248
00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:10.890
still your day to the office, Halloween party, the Beavis to your Butthead,

249
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:15.810
and then you let them go and find the next show to binge watch at a disturbingly

250
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.160
frenzy pace. But what do you think wise crack? What makes a good finale?

251
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.430
And if you're interested in a deeper breakdown on the game of Thrones finale,

252
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.010
check out the deep or dumb video we put out a bit ago,

253
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.650
but you can't guess our conclusion while you're there.
