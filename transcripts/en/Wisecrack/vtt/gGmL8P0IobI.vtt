<v 0>This video is brought to you by opera.</v>

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.220
Hey, wisecrack, Jared here, let me ask you something.

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.270
If you had the chance to wipe out the worst thing that ever happened to you to

4
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:16.850
make it so that you had no memory of the event at all,

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.090
would you do it or more importantly, should you,

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.280
these are the questions at the heart of today's movie,

7
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:25.760
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind first released in 2004.

8
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:30.470
This lasting film opened to rave reviews, charmed by innovative cinematography,

9
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:35.120
unusual structure and an all-star cast critics and audiences alike fell in love

10
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:39.290
with this quirky haunting story about the nature of human relationships and

11
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:44.060
heartbreak. But after 16 years, does the movie holdup was Kate Winslet,

12
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:47.690
just lucky enough to cash in on the manic pixie dream girl phenomenon before it

13
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:48.410
got stale,

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.190
or is there something really profound about the relationship she and Jim Carrey

15
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:54.470
portray on the screen to answer this question,

16
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.990
we have to get to know the uncredited star of this movie,

17
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.880
the human brain specifically,

18
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:02.420
we're going to look to neuroscience to examine what this film says about the way

19
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:05.600
the brain works and what that means for us as human beings.

20
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:08.330
Living with those brains sound complicated.

21
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.390
<v 1>Smithies this isn't rocket science it's brain.</v>

22
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.800
<v 0>Don't worry.</v>

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.010
We'll break it down for you in this wisecrack condition on eternal sunshine of

24
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:17.030
the spotless mind,

25
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.740
deep or dumb and spoilers ahead for one of the few movies ever to put Frodo

26
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:23.630
Baggins in the hope in the same room.

27
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.070
<v 1>I haven't really had much luck with the ladies and maybe we stop stealing their</v>

28
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:28.904
panties.

29
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.160
<v 0>But before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to this week.</v>

30
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.640
Sponsor opera. We're all online a lot these days.

31
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:37.490
So why not have the best browsing experience possible?

32
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.880
Opera is the all-in-one browser that gives you features to connect to your

33
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:45.080
favorite platforms and make your time online, more productive. For starters,

34
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:48.830
you can design the way you want your browser to look and organize all your tabs.

35
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.490
There's also workspace a feature that allows you to create and customize the way

36
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:54.890
your tabs are saved for optimal workflow.

37
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.700
Opera also features integrated messengers. So you can access Facebook,

38
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.760
messenger, WhatsApp, and telegram all on the side.

39
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.030
So you don't have to check every app individually. While browsing.

40
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:07.280
You can watch videos from Netflix, YouTube,

41
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.090
or almost any other video provider with the browsers video pop-out tool.

42
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.240
They even offer a built-in VPN and ad blocker,

43
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:17.330
which saves you the headache of downloading extensions and keeping track of

44
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:20.660
subscriptions. Opera includes all this and more,

45
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.840

So make sure you use our link. And now back to the show, all right, guys,

51
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:41.750
let's do a quick recap. Sad sack.

52
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.900
Joel bearish wakes up one day to find a huge scratch on his car.

53
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:47.450
And most of his journal entries missing on whim.

54
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:51.350
He ditches his usual commute and hops on a train to Montauk where he meets and

55
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:55.460
starts to fall in love with the quirky and impulsive Clementine Christian ski.

56
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.950
After some jumping back and forth on the timeline,

57
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.210
we discovered that Joel and have actually met before. In fact,

58
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.750
they've had a whole life together dating for what appears to have been several

59
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.320
years.

60
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.680
Neither lover recognizes the other because they independently arranged to have

61
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:12.670
their memories of the painful relationship erased by a company called lacuna,

62
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.120
Inc.

63
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.600
The film cuts between Joel's bedroom were Lacount technicians are working to

64
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.260
wipe memories of Clementine from his brain and the inside of his head.

65
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.130
As he changes his mind about the procedure and fights to keep those memories

66
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.970
safe while Joel and Clementine do ultimately lose their memories of each other,

67
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.880
they managed to retain a vague impression of their feelings,

68
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.600
which sends them to Montauk at the same time. At the end of the film,

69
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.980
it's heavily implied that the whole cycle of their relationship will begin again

70
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.440
to discern whether the film is deeper, not.

71
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:44.860
We need to dive into some philosophical and ethical questions about the proper

72
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:47.590
use of technology and our Nate human abilities.

73
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.480
When it comes to building our identities,

74
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.600
selves and experiences at a very basic level,

75
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:56.530
the movie's plot is driven by Joel's choices about what to do with his brain.

76
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.920
That is whether or not to eliminate Clementine from his consciousness.

77
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.880
He starts off wanting to alter his brain even to the point of harming it in

78
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:07.300
order to avoid the pain of having loved and lost Clementine.

79
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.220
<v 1>Is there any risk of brain damage? Well, uh,</v>

80
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.710
technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's,

81
00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:19.830
it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking, nothing you don't miss.

82
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.940
<v 0>As he goes through the night and starts to realize what losing Clementine really</v>

83
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:28.320
means. The eradication of a huge part of his life and emotional experience.

84
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.730
He makes a choice to fight the procedure and preserve as much of her as he can

85
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.103
paint and all.

86
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.400
<v 1>Call it off.</v>

87
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.870
<v 0>Those decisions, boil down to a choice between comfort and growth.</v>

88
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.100
He can live a diminished but easy life without Clementine or opt for a harder

89
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:46.080
but richer experience with her in it.

90
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.070
But this is also a choice between two ways of approaching his physical brain,

91
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.790
either as something to be trimmed down and controlled for the sake of efficiency

92
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.000
or something to be used for its full messy potential,

93
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.020
whatever the consequences of that growth and freedom might be philosopher.

94
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.560
Catherine Malibu has written about this exact dilemma in her conveniently titled

95
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:06.330
book. What should we do with our brain?

96
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.320
The book draws on neuroscientific research to discuss the concept of the brain's

97
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.570
plasticity. When we say plasticity,

98
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:16.200
many of us are actually thinking about the far more limited and nefarious

99
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:17.880
concept of flexibility.

100
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.590
Plasticity involves adaptation and according to Malibu is an agency of

101
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:25.230
disobedience to every constituted form.

102
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.640
Our refusal to submit to a model to be flexible is to receive a form or

103
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:33.510
impression to be docile, to not explode. Put it another way.

104
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:36.810
Research and experience show that our brains are able to both adapt to

105
00:05:36.811 --> 00:05:41.490
circumstances and resistant to work with change and to create it to

106
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:42.810
borrow Malibu's analogy.

107
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.860
Ourselves are like plastic explosives able to mold to a given shape if

108
00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:50.790
necessary, but also capable of radically changing our own form.

109
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:54.960
And that of our environment flexibility on the other hand involves always taking

110
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:57.950
the path of least resistance. Look from this point of view,

111
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:01.850
Joel's decision to erase or keep his memories of Clementine can be seen as a

112
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:06.530
choice between exercising the full plasticity of his brain or doing the flexible

113
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:10.220
thing by destroying those parts of his brain that are making you uncomfortable

114
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.800
in both Malibu's book and eternal sunshine.

115
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:16.730
Flexibility is presented as the guiding philosophy of neoliberal capitalism.

116
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.020
According to both techs,

117
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.100
we live in an economic system that demands flexibility from its actors and

118
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:23.690
offers them products and services,

119
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.740
which will increase their flexibility for price eternal sunshine,

120
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:30.290
perhaps simplistically portrays business.

121
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.160
As the process of taking advantage of people who are suffering from confusion or

122
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:34.670
pain.

123
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.720
Joel's very first lines frame Valentine's day as a corporate plot to sabotage

124
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:39.800
our emotional state.

125
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.430
<v 2>Today is a holiday and admitted by greeting card company to make people feel</v>

126
00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:46.264
like crap.

127
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.230
<v 0>But the film ultimately earns that critique keeping with the same theme.</v>

128
00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:53.680
The movie makes it clear that lacuna Inc survives by profiting off of people's

129
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:57.100
desire to rid those crappy feelings of heartache. As Mary points out.

130
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.800
<v 2>I told him pre Valentine's day is our busy time.</v>

131
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.870
<v 0>Okay? It's even implied that clients may become dependent on the memory erasing</v>

132
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:08.170
procedure over time and will go to extreme lengths to get it done.

133
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.640
<v 2>No, I'm sorry. You can't have the procedure done three times.</v>

134
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.000
<v 0>The ways in which the company takes advantage of compromised,</v>

135
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:18.280
people become less subtle and more disturbing.

136
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:21.310
As the film progresses shortly after arriving at Joel's apartment,

137
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.040
the lacuna Inc technicians assigned to wipe his memories,

138
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.150
turn his home into their own personal Airbnb, drinking, getting high,

139
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:30.460
and even having sex near his unconscious body.

140
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.830
This trend takes a turn for the seriously up.

141
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:35.680
When we learned that one of the technicians stole a pair of clementines

142
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.140
underwear while there were erasing her memory, I mean,

143
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:39.160
they were cleaned and all,

144
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.000
and that he's been using information stolen from Joel's letters to try and trick

145
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:46.930
her into falling in love with him. The unethical behavior reaches its climax.

146
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:49.180
When we find out that Howard coerced, Mary,

147
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.990
his own secretary to wipe her memory after the two of them had an affair

148
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:53.710
together.

149
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.850
<v 2>Oh, hell yeah, we agreed it's for the best.</v>

150
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.080
<v 0>What Joel Clementine and lacunas other customers lack that leaves them open to</v>

151
00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:06.070
such exploitation is the flexibility that society demands of them.

152
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.881
Such a demand.

153
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:10.390
According to Malibu is at odds with our true nature as human beings,

154
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.080
as beings with plastic brains, we can indeed bend when we wish,

155
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.780
but we're also capable of resistance creation.

156
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.860
And other acts of free will in the face of obstacles do often know in a culture.

157
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:23.260
So tightly focused on work and productivity.

158
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.550
The full plasticity of our brains is reduced to the concept of flexibility and

159
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:31.600
presented simply as the possibility of increasing or decreasing performance.

160
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.930
Very often the brain is analyzed as personal capital.

161
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.360
This idea of the brain as personal capital,

162
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.720
something you can optimize and invest in for greater output,

163
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.770
like a factory production line is even more prevalent today than when Malibu

164
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:45.640
first wrote about it.

165
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.140
In 2008 in Silicon Valley and beyond we find workers taking drastic steps to

166
00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:53.950
alter their brain functioning for improved performance on the job orders engage

167
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:58.170
in so-called brain practices, find tuned, sleep and break schedules,

168
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.550
the use of nootropics and even LSD microdosing in an attempt to put in longer

169
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:05.910
hours and produce more work, whether or not this serve their own health,

170
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.463
wellbeing, or growth.

171
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.430
These practices and others are examples of Malibu's flexibility,

172
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.180
inaction hijacking your own brain chemistry to meet an unreasonable deadline,

173
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:19.950
demonstrates a profound ability and willingness to adapt to circumstances rather

174
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:22.230
than improve them from an economic perspective.

175
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.450
Then to be flexible is to upskill,

176
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:29.430
reorient and change as often as necessary to satisfy the demands of society,

177
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.210
rather than take the drastic action of trying to change those demands.

178
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.160
Lacount ink promises its customers.

179
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:39.360
The flexibility that is so highly prized in our society and economy without

180
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:40.260
their procedures done,

181
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:44.880
Dr. Howard's patients are inflexible fixated on past lovers, dead pets,

182
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:48.300
or any of the countless disappointments and setbacks that are part of being

183
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:52.380
human. He explains his service to Joel as a way for people to become unstuck,

184
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.750
not by overcoming the challenges they face.

185
00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.170
<v 2>Kinski was not happy and she wanted to move on.</v>

186
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.420
We provide that.

187
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.130
<v 0>But by smoothing out their lives so they can continue forward uninterrupted.</v>

188
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.080
<v 2>When you awake in the morning,</v>

189
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:14.780
you find yourself in your own bed as if nothing in her

190
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:15.420
discussion of.

191
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.460
<v 0>Mood, regulating drugs,</v>

192
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:19.820
like Prozac Malibu claims that our society commonly judges,

193
00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:23.120
such treatments based on their ability to reduce vulnerability,

194
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.700
chronic disturbance and psychical precariousness,

195
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.980
and give back the appetite for mobility,

196
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.240
the capacity to rid oneself of rigidity and a fixidity in one's identity.

197
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.081
In other words,

198
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:37.040
we say that a psychiatric drug or treatment is working when it makes the person

199
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:41.240
using it more flexible in their approach to work relationships, et cetera. Now,

200
00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:43.880
this is not to say that Malibu Malibu's against such medication.

201
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.790
On the contrary, she makes a point of saying how useful it can be.

202
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.760
She's simply pointing out that the discourse around the effectiveness of

203
00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:53.210
psychiatric medication tends to focus on whether it makes the person more

204
00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:54.560
pliable, productive,

205
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.550
and eager to fit in rather than on whether it helps them be more strong-willed

206
00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.810
creative, et cetera.

207
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.640
Howard's procedure can be thought of as just such a flexibility enhancing mood

208
00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:07.130
stabilizer. In some sense, he is a modern day.

209
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.260
[inaudible] cutting out those parts of the brain,

210
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:12.650
which are thought to be the source of uncomfortable unproductive feelings like

211
00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:14.660
sadness, depression, or anxiety.

212
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.930
When the wider system demands its individual members adapt.

213
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.790
No measure is too extreme.

214
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.470
What unites Howard's patients or his target demographic is a desire to shortcut

215
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:27.920
the hard work of integrating negative experiences into their lives.

216
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.430
So they can go back to living in a way that doesn't require change.

217
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.840
They want to express flexibility rather than plasticity and Howard is willing to

218
00:11:35.841 --> 00:11:36.500
help them do.

219
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.600
<v 2>It now, or just makes it all go away.</v>

220
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.320
<v 0>Clementine poignantly expresses this understandable wish to wipe away</v>

221
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.420
difficulties while describing her childhood.

222
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.220
<v 2>My favorite is this ugly girls doll like called Clementine.</v>

223
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:55.000
And I keep yelling at her. You can't be, be pretty.

224
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.530
It's weird. Like if I can transform her,

225
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.220
I would magically change too.

226
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.500
<v 0>If as Malibu claims, trying to magically change ourselves,</v>

227
00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:11.010
by being eternally accommodating is a waste of our true potential.

228
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.960
Then what should we do instead?

229
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.940
What would a fully realized plastic brain and self actually be like in

230
00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:18.421
other words,

231
00:12:18.421 --> 00:12:22.470
if we choose not to automatically go along with the demands to be flexible,

232
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.860
then what is the alternative we're fighting for? According to her,

233
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.240
the plasticity of the self implies balance between the preservation of constancy

234
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.470
and the exposure of this constancy to accidents to the outside,

235
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.790
to otherness in general, she adds that if we didn't explode at each transition,

236
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.820
if we didn't destroy ourselves a bit, we could not live.

237
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.830
The simplify Malibu claims that to be really human to express plasticity is to

238
00:12:46.831 --> 00:12:50.730
balance the need to adapt against the need for growth and change. Yes,

239
00:12:50.731 --> 00:12:53.550
we all decide to make sacrifices for the sake of productivity.

240
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.450
From time to time,

241
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.960
we might stay late at the office for one night because the boss asked us to or

242
00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:00.960
skip out on movie night with friends because our teacher wants that term paper

243
00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:02.010
submitted by midnight.

244
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.540
But when we become so flexible that we iron out every inefficiency in our lives,

245
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.780
when we're so afraid of explosions, that we take no risks,

246
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.850
then we're in trouble. In other words,

247
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:15.840
the spotless mind from the Alexander Pope poem that gives the movie its name,

248
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.760
isn't a desirable thing at all. We need our spots, traumas, heartaches,

249
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.480
et cetera,

250
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.530
in order to live full lives that have some meaning outside of our ability to

251
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:26.610
satisfy demand.

252
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.040
<v 2>How happy is the blameless vessels? Lot</v>

253
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.580
the world forgetting by the world for God,

254
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.720
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,

255
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.790
each prayer accepted in each wish resigned.

256
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.750
<v 0>So what do we do as individuals in a society that demand,</v>

257
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:47.340
we stamp out the troublesome,

258
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.070
unproductive parts of our brains in order to succeed,

259
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.470
how should we make the best use of our brains?

260
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.580
That is how do we accomplish the most cyberpunk of goals that Malibu sets up in

261
00:13:56.581 --> 00:14:00.480
her books, opening pages, neuronal liberation. Her answer is symbol.

262
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.100
We ought to refuse to be flexible and exercise the explosive creative dimensions

263
00:14:05.101 --> 00:14:09.390
of our brains plasticity to the fullest extent possible as she puts it,

264
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.800
we should visualize the possibility of saying no to an afflicting economic,

265
00:14:13.801 --> 00:14:18.240
political and MediaTek culture that celebrates only the triumph of flexibility,

266
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.450
blessing obedient, individuals who have no greater merit than that,

267
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:23.670
of knowing how to bow their heads and smile.

268
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.990
Joel Clementine and Mary take up this fight by pushing back against the eraser

269
00:14:27.991 --> 00:14:32.340
of their own and other's memories that is by being difficult and refusing to let

270
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:35.040
things run smoothly. For the sake of smoothness.

271
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.090
Joel demonstrates plasticity by working with his projected image of Clementine

272
00:14:39.091 --> 00:14:41.100
to evade Howard and his technician.

273
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.900
<v 2>What if you take me somewhere else,</v>

274
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.530
somewhere where I don't belong and we hide there till morning.

275
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.590
<v 0>When it becomes clear that he won't be able to run forever.</v>

276
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.320
Joel even manages to seed a subconscious direction for his waking post-procedure

277
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:57.080
self again, via his image of Clementine.

278
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.630
While Joel wakes up and follows his subliminal urgings back to Clementine Mary

279
00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.280
rage, the lacuna Inc offices,

280
00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:09.910
and sends out all of their files to their previous customers in effect,

281
00:15:09.911 --> 00:15:13.420
ruining the procedure for all of them and upsetting the smooth operation of the

282
00:15:13.421 --> 00:15:14.254
company.

283
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.600
<v 2>My name is Mary [inaudible] we've met, but you don't remember.</v>

284
00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:17.470
You don't remember me.

285
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.880
I worked current com hire tired to have part of your memory erase.

286
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.430
<v 0>With their painful history. Thus revealed to them.</v>

287
00:15:24.431 --> 00:15:28.000
Present a Joel and Clementine must decide whether or not to pursue a

288
00:15:28.001 --> 00:15:31.480
relationship together knowing in advance that they are likely to hurt each other

289
00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:36.430
very badly. Their choice is the film's ultimate example of plasticity inaction.

290
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.610
<v 2>That's the other thing that I don't like about you, but you won't,</v>

291
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.220
but you will know you will think of things and I'll get bored with you and feel

292
00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:47.230
trapped because that's what happens with me.

293
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.420
<v 0>The flexible thing for Joel and Clementine to do in this situation would be to</v>

294
00:15:52.421 --> 00:15:56.110
accept the futility of pursuing a relationship together and go their separate

295
00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:58.720
ways to live comfortable, productive lives,

296
00:15:58.721 --> 00:16:01.240
either alone or with better suited partners.

297
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.080
Instead they willingly blow up their chances at untroubled singledom or

298
00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:07.540
functional romance opting instead for a dynamic,

299
00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:12.010
which has been empirically proven to not work inherent in our plasticity is the

300
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:16.330
ability to make choices of our own free will perhaps especially when those

301
00:16:16.331 --> 00:16:18.160
choices don't make much sense.

302
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.360
The film's final shot is a looping clip of Joel and Clementine playing on a snow

303
00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:26.290
covered beach in Montauk implying that this cycle is likely to play itself out

304
00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:30.370
again, their relationship isn't perfect. It may not even be a good idea,

305
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.540
but it is their choice made in defiance of flexibility and therefore an

306
00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:39.400
expression of the brain's plasticity that is its vast potential to create and

307
00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:42.130
destroy both itself and its environment.

308
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.420
These neuro rebels have done Malibu proud and they've earned themselves a solid

309
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.800
deep from us.

310
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.160
But what do you think wise crack are there ethical or practical limits to how

311
00:16:51.161 --> 00:16:55.060
much we can and should optimize our brains for given purposes,

312
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.690
have a favorite movie or TV show that explores how people relate to their own

313
00:16:58.691 --> 00:16:59.440
minds.
