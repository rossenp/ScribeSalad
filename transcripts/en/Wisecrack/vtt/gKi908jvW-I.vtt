00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>This video is brought to you by curiosity strain.</v>

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.010
Hey, what's up wisecrack,

3
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:14.030
Greg Edwards here look ever since the tonight show aired in 1954,

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.110
the American late night talk show has been as ingrained in American culture as

5
00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:19.910
baseball, Apple pie,

6
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.810
and using super soakers to drink tequila or hot summer days.

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.670
And no one has done more to demean his hollow format and comedian Eric Andre,

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.150
who has used a germ where the leave a trail of horrified celebrities,

9
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.340
befuddled pedestrians, and decimated wooden desk in his destructive wig.

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.170
But is there more to the bizarre antics in his pension from being gross as

11
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:46.730
hell? Is this really just a way to smuggle a deeper message to his viewers?

12
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.810
Let's find out on this wise crack edition on the comedy of Eric Andre,

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.460
but before we get into it,

14
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.970
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor curiosity stream.

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.570

22
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.590
a series that explores our technology shapes us and how the future may be

23

impacted by our innovate.

30
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.280
And now back to the show, here's a quick rundown for the uninitiated.

31
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.320
Andre is a standard comedian.

32
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.330
<v 2>Racial sensitivity training. He started saying the N word like crazy.</v>

33
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:07.100
They're like, dude, this is supposed to have the opposite effect pop up active.

34
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.150
How did you learn to do that?

35
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.440
What the same way everybody learns the day I hit puberty wizard appeared.

36
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.940
<v 0>And dystopian talk show hosts who since 2012 as hosted the Eric</v>

37
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:21.560
Andre show on adult swim with the side, the hilarious handlebars,

38
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.110
it features a mix of in-studio bits.

39
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.380
<v 1>Interviews you ever heard of a robot before.</v>

40
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.290
<v 0>I don't even know what that means. Hidden camera pranks.</v>

41
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.850
<v 2>I'm Mr. Burrito, the human pizza. We spoke earlier. I'm from the pizza society.</v>

42
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:43.280
And I'm here to talk to you about pizza safety and.

43
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.570
<v 0>The occasional musical guests. [inaudible]</v>

44
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.050
It's often very weird, usually very funny.

45
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.780
And if you watch it up and so with your step-mom Gayle,

46
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.930
she'll be very confused and extremely concerned,

47
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.540
but gal can be assured that Andre's more than just goofing around. In fact,

48
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:05.560
he's working in the vein of a tradition first use to describe gross looking

49
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:10.150
Roman ruins and later applied to everything from weird gargoyles to

50
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.130
carnival and freak shows the grotesque while the girl says was once used as a

51
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:19.720
way to strike the fear of God into the illiterate masses with this nightmare

52
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:24.670
fuel, it really became what we know it as today at the turn of the 20th century,

53
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:29.410
when the Italian playwrights created what critics call fear of the grotesque,

54
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.900
the grotesque is more than just being gross.

55
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.220
It's about transgression by pushing boundaries and celebrating the abnormal.

56
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.210
It helps us better understand our allegedly normal world.

57
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.380
Andre is far from the first person to use the weird and uncomfortable for

58
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:46.360
cinematic effect. Filmmaker,

59
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:49.870
John Waters put his name on the map for among other things,

60
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.960
making a movie where the main character eats dogs.

61
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.400
Then there's David Lynch who was more partial to separate years,

62
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.990
but in Andrea's case,

63
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.770
the normal world he's transgression is the celebrity world.

64
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.380
And what better microcosm of that,

65
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.210
then the talk show and doing so he wants us to question how normal the

66
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:12.100
entertainment world is after all.

67
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.790
You only need to look as far as the opening credits to know that the Eric Andre

68
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.110
shell is going to be a million, middle fingers to Jaylin Owens,

69
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:23.680
Jimmy Fallon and all their guests where a traditional show is a house band

70
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.270
playing crowd, pleasing, jazz.

71
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.370
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

72
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.790
<v 0>Great house bed OS for the John was discorded a chaotic cousin.</v>

73
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.360
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

74
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.361
<v 0>Well,</v>

75
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:42.120
our traditional opening credit sequence might have some B roll of the house.

76
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.620
Our city skyline,

77
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.720
Andre uses this time to psychotically destroy his set and occasionally get his

78
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.100
sex fault raided by the fence.

79
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.690
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

80
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.580
<v 0>It seemed bizarre and arbitrary.</v>

81
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.660
It destroys the illusion of normalcy that surrounds the late night format,

82
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.210
giving the audience a taste of what's to come.

83
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.540
The same can be said in laundries interviews with celebrity guests,

84
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.600
during which he'll do anything from Santa rat, moose

85
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.130
Tend to actually pee his pants by making these interviews as weird and

86
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:19.080
unpredictable as humanly possible.

87
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.420
Andre is transgressing the normal formula for how a host is meant to interview

88
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:27.390
guests, a formula defined by prescreen,

89
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:32.010
softball questions clear sat us for plugging their newest product or bill

90
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.690
and so on. Are you proud of it? Are you aware of how good it is and in doing so?

91
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.280
Andrea exposes just how meaningless scripted and sometimes straight up stupid

92
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.210
these interviews and other talk shows trumps really are the shooting of your

93
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.430
onstage band. Really any more fake than rehearse pleasantries. All right.

94
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:52.830
Maybe it is a little more fake, but still,

95
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.430
and while it might at times seem like he's just being a Dick.

96
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.830
According to Andre,

97
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.970
it's not just about making somebody uncomfortable or harassing somebody or

98
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:03.530
giving somebody a hard time.

99
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.730
I set out to be the most incompetent talk show host of all time.

100
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.980
It's more about blowing the guest's mind,

101
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.100
having them feel sort of an out of body experience.

102
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.770
He's the Morpheus of pop culture, if you will,

103
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.030
but Andre isn't just transgressing the polite handshaking of meeting Jennifer

104
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.540
Lawrence on the tonight show, but pushing boundaries in his real world stunts,

105
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.900
we can start to ask similar questions about the lines he's crossing.

106
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:31.400
Then take the time to Eric ran through a civil war in magnet as a shackled

107
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:32.300
runaway slave.

108
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.050
And because Andre has a tendency to push the line until he can't push any

109
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:39.350
further, there's a slave catcher chasing up with a whip

110
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.410
while laundry stuff. Certainly weird. It forces us to ask more basic questions.

111
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:49.700
Like isn't it more weird that people do historical reenactments without

112
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:52.610
addressing certain conveniently on minute details.

113
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.720
Andre even said in the interview that the idea came to him after seeing the ad

114
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:58.720
for colonial Williamsburg where, well,

115
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:02.590
my black brothers and sisters getting their reenactment on.

116
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.010
And then I was like, Oh yeah, black people.

117
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:10.960
Weren't having a good time in the real colonial Williamsburg is

118
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:12.370
Andre the weird one?

119
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.410
Or is it the people who dress up as soldiers defending slavery by disorienting

120
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:21.100
our perception for a second, we're able to see the situation for whatever. Yeah.

121
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.510
[inaudible] I don't know about you,

122
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:33.430
but I like to dress up as a member of the Chilean death squad on the weekend for

123
00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:35.470
the history. If most artists,

124
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.710
an active expression of norms like Norman Rockwell painting,

125
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:42.640
celebrating the joy of getting together and murdering a nice juicy Turkey.

126
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.420
The growth task is about questioning those norms at every step.

127
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.940
Andre is trying to achieve something similar.

128
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.810
When he runs into a tea party meeting to kindly let the attendees know,

129
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.240
it might be absurd to jump on a stage and an Alex Jones, a man,

130
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:03.160
and then self identify as a novelist. I'm not a Democrat either. I'm a nihilist,

131
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.540
but we can also ask isn't Joe's brand of snake oil fueled,

132
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:11.140
conspiracy politics, deeply nihilistic. In the first place,

133
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.090
we might compare Andres out of studio antics to those of say David

134
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.440
letter, Laderman broke up the monotony of studio time with almost purposely

135
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.200
non-confrontational humor like strapping,

136
00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:27.460
a camera to a rollerskate monkey are literally dropping random things off

137
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:31.210
buildings. I don't leave the boy that any iota of social commentary,

138
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.070
these stats are put in stark relief by the wild and Cindy era political

139
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:39.700
ads, Andre incorporates into his show by turning of a law,

140
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.870
reenactment or political rally into a situation that feels that normal and

141
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:47.350
unstable. We're forced to see the normal in a whole new light.

142
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.880
Here's my hotel Canon well you'd have sex with my wife. If you drop acid,

143
00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:55.530
before you watch the 1998 remake of the parent trap,

144
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.550
he realized that it's actually a film about how all Americans have a split

145
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:01.440
consciousness on one side,

146
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.970
we're rugged American individualist and on the other British knobs.

147
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.820
And those hands are always trying to re-ignite for that.

148
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.650
Our parents will love and accept us,

149
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.420
But he didn't think we're going to skip the real nasty digits. I mean,

150
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.093
quite little.

151
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.890
<v 3>This is the back of my face.</v>

152
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.730
[inaudible].

153
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.020
<v 0>Godrej has a deep love for all substances capable of being expelled from the</v>

154
00:09:33.021 --> 00:09:33.854
human body.

155
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.510
Take the iconic example of Andre's interview with Lauren Conrad star of

156
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.880
MTV's the Hills, her publicist,

157
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.510
clearly hadn't done their homework and it's from the moment she walks on set,

158
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:47.990
she's visibly uncomfortable, but always wanting to be a good house.

159
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.120
Andre goes the extra lanes to make sure she's relaxed by volunteering on

160
00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:57.650
his desk and then eating it in front of her. In case you listen to it,

161
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.480
he first pukes all over his desk and then he tries to suddenly eat the puke.

162
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.900
Conrad responds by getting the hell out of there.

163
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.620
So is there any way to explain this that doesn't end with,

164
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.390
and that's why Eric Andre is a discussing human who never should have been given

165
00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:17.990
a cell in a set of watching it. We should all just watch reruns of Alan,

166
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.140
a host we can admire for kind treatment and mothers.

167
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.130
Here's what Andre later recounted and an interview about Conrad.

168
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.660
I'm not trying to be a Dick. She's cool. I have no beef with her. It's just,

169
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:32.960
you know, I'm a psychopath when I'm doing the interviews. Oh,

170
00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:36.200
she doesn't take it personally, but she didn't like it too much.

171
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.790
Here's the deal. We walk around in our day-to-day lives, wearing clothes,

172
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.840
eating well prepared meals and wearing masks over on disease halls.

173
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.140
Trying to get that underneath all of our civilized practices.

174
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.850
We are animals that fart and burp and and protect our

175
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:56.420
environment. And Brittany Johnson's night break. Wardee even worse,

176
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.220
Andre and volts. This humbling,

177
00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:01.790
embarrassing feeling in front of quote unquote celebrities.

178
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.290
Their entire careers typically depend on our belief that they're are larger than

179
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:10.910
life, that they almost certainly transcend the disgusting reality of their farts

180
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.800
loudly reverberating in the toilet bowl in the shared office bathroom. Sorry,

181
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:19.790
Jared, my bag. All right. What's more he does.

182
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.470
So on the squeaky clean suit clad turf of the talk show where hosts focus on

183
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.490
family friendly, zingers and topical, but not edgy commentary.

184
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.870
It's also worth mentioning that late night hosts Jack Paar got in trouble for

185
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:36.890
making a joke about the water closet in 1960, by contrast,

186
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.330
Andre spent an entire year now grooming himself before the filming of his fourth

187
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.110
season.

188
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.730
Not even letting the costume department ever wash his suit like James

189
00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:51.230
Corden, singing carpool karaoke. Andre is reveling in his own filth,

190
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:56.320
but all of that said his air gross hell yes. A hundred times.

191
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:58.240
Yes, he's so gross.

192
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.400
And it's shocking that he's been able to land so many seemingly normal romantic

193
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.790
partners like Rosario, freaking Dawson,

194
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.720
who was now dating Senator Cory Booker. Andre is gross,

195
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.370
but he is using this Grossman's to create his own theater of the grotesque in

196
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:19.300
which he is pushing boundaries and testing limits to make us think about how

197
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:23.500
weird and often disgusting our supposedly normal world is.

198
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.910
And just like a batch of your cousin, Scott, special brownies, they're gone.

199
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:32.470
Dre show was able to blow our minds and make us see things in a whole new light.

200
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.550
So next time someone calls you weird for eating an ice cream sandwich and a

201
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:37.384
shower,

202
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:42.130
a gross for throwing up all over wall street or a criminal for having a

203
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:44.650
contest to see how many babies you can hold.

204
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.240
You can respond by simply explaining that like Eric, Andre,

205
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.980
you are an artist using the grotesque to push the boundaries of experience,

206
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.750
but while you think why is crack,

207
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.130
does he just a nasty comedian or is there a method to his madness?

208
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.750
