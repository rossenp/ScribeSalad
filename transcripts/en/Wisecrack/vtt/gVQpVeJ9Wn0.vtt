<v 0>This episode is brought to you by Ridge wallet.</v>

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.240
Hey wisecrack, Jared here. Hollywood's a tricky business.

3
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.180
Audience's tastes constantly shift over time.

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.350
As genre that's popular in one moment can run out of fashion a second later,

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.700
but there's one thing you can always count on. People love to be scared.

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.260
That's why no matter the decade,

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.790
horror films have been a constant fixture in cinema from the universal monsters

8
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:31.850
of the thirties, to the slashers of the eighties and nineties,

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.480
to the so-called torture porn of the early aughts horror today,

10
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:39.200
though isn't necessarily categorized by mass killers or monsters.

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.520
Instead it's become mostly synonymous with one company Blumhouse.

12
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.750
Since 2007,

13
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:49.730
Blumhouse has revitalized the genre with hit after hit like paranormal activity,

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.000
the purge get out us and many more.

15
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.630
Their films have pushed horror into uncharted territory.

16
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.370
Gaining both commercial and critical success held many have even labeled this

17
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:02.270
current period.

18
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.620
The golden age of horror on the surface Blumhouse has films all appear to be

19
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.220
different. Running the gamut from ghost stories to slashers,

20
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.200
to sociopolitical commentaries.

21
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.350
<v 1>I would have voted for Obama for a third term. If I could.</v>

22
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.240
<v 0>Producer and CEO of Blumhouse,</v>

23
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:21.080
Jason Bluhm even stated that he's always been very conscious of not repeating

24
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.660
himself. He said wearing my entrepreneur's hat.

25
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.940
I'm very conscious of not falling into a pattern.

26
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.070
The tenants of the company are the same,

27
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.320
but the kinds of things that we're doing are very,

28
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:32.000
very different than 10 years ago.

29
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.960
But the secret sauce of Blumhouse is success might actually be rooted in being

30
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.790
cheapskates. According to Bluhm, the only real pattern is an economic one.

31
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.110
Unlike other studios,

32
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:46.010
which pour tens or hundreds of millions dollars into a single film,

33
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.720
Blumhouse tries to make sure each film costs no more than 5 billion by being so

34
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:55.130
budget conscious Blumhouse has strangely enough stumbled into making some of the

35
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:59.390
most insightful commentaries on a basic part of American life, the home.

36
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.830
So let's find out how in this wisecrack edition on how Blumhouse changed horror

37
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.280
and spoilers ahead for Blumhouse sprites like paranormal activity,

38
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.990
insidious sinister, get out Halloween and us. But before we continue,

39
00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:14.720
I want to give a shout out to this week, sponsored the Ridge wallet.

pocket and still want to maximize the amount of cards you carry,

And now back to the show since Blumhouse needs to keep their costs low,

56
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.420
most of their films are set in a single location and shot in one of the

57
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:18.370
cheapest, easiest places. A filmmaker can find a house money aside,

58
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.840
most horror films focused on the opposite showing what happens when people leave

59
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.410
their home.

60
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.860
Just look at some of the most popular horror films before Blumhouse arrived on

61
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:28.720
the scene. In the 1960s,

62
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.100
a young woman left home seeking safety in a creepy motel with great

63
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:36.190
amenities. In the 1970s,

64
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.450
a group of teens went on a road trip only to face off against this beautiful

65
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.370
family. In the 1980s,

66
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.080
a family leaves home to become caretakers at a hotel only to be haunted by

67
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.290
clear building code violations in the nineties,

68
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.280
some teen vloggers ventured into the woods in search of a witch and things

69
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.880
didn't go much better. And in the early aughts,

70
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.600
a bunch of horny college students went overseas only to end up. Well,

71
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:05.080
you can probably guess the templates in all these films is the same.

72
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.460
A group of attractive people go on a road trip or camping or overseas,

73
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.480
and typically die in the most horrific fashion possible. The message.

74
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.790
If only everyone could just stay home,

75
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.370
then nothing bad would happen in these films.

76
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.920
Homes are often depicted as safe havens,

77
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.530
a refuge from the horrors of the outside world.

78
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.340
In the midst of terror characters will often remark how they wish they could be

79
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:30.670
home or talk about what they're going to do when they get back to their real

80
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:31.500
lives.

81
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.333
<v 2>Hi,</v>

82
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.773
I just want go home.

83
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.330
<v 0>Are exceptions to this rule, of course,</v>

84
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:46.620
but two notable ones are the genres of the haunted house and the home invasion.

85
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.430
A typical haunted house film focuses on, well, of course,

86
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:52.170
a house in East films,

87
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.280
a group of people will either knowingly or unknowingly move into a haunted

88
00:04:56.281 --> 00:05:00.360
structure. The houses in these films don't represent safety and security.

89
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.770
They are unknown spaces that we know from the start will doom yet another set of

90
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:08.760
hopeless fools and in the home invasion, horror genre and outside force,

91
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.770
most often a killer threatens the domestic stability of a family stalking

92
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.690
and then attacking them in their home.

93
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.000
The family must then ward off their intruders,

94
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:22.710
like an unwanted vermin and reestablish the home as a beacon of safety.

95
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.970
These films often end with the killer being literally expelled from the house.

96
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.720
And the closing shot is frequently a wide shot of the house.

97
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.490
The sun coming up in the distance,

98
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.960
showing the horror is over and everything is safe once more. Thus,

99
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.250
ultimately the point of these films is to restore the sanctity of the home.

100
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.610
However, Blumhouse subtly began to shift how horror films,

101
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.180
depict homes in the process, redefining both the haunted house,

102
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.680
the home invasion, genre,

103
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.870
and horror as a whole take their breakout hit 2000 sevens paranormal activity.

104
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.630
Unlike the typical haunted house film focuses on a creepy Gothic and foreboding

105
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:03.830
home paranormal activities house is well completely ordinary.

106
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.430
There's nothing spooky or creepy about the way it's portrayed. In fact,

107
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:11.030
the early scenes of the film go out of the way to do the opposite painting,

108
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.810
the most idealistic portrait of the home possible in the opening scene,

109
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.840
Micah films around his house, capturing a shot of his girlfriend,

110
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.674
returning home,

111
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.400
which reveals their lovely suburban neighborhood in these early scenes.

112
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.900
The camera lingers on furniture and decor like we're in an episode of MTV's

113
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:30.980
Crips and the exact same thing happens in paranormal activity. Two,

114
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.600
the sequel opens with the family,

115
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.900
recording everything in their house for the posterity of their newborn.

116
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.810
Yet again, it's a cribs episode. Come to life.

117
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.400
The camera's showing off the open kitchen, the white sofas, another huge TV.

118
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.590
And let's not forget a jacuzzi,

119
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.940
both paranormal activity films take the time to show just how pristine these

120
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:50.750
homes are.

121
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.590
They are the quintessential beacons of a safe upper middle-class life.

122
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.820
But of course not everything is as it seems a demonic entity, Hans,

123
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.260
both households though.

124
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:03.890
The first signs of it are presented as common household disturbances

125
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.240
in the opening scene of paranormal activity.

126
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.780
Katie thinks she hears something strange. Could it be demonic?

127
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.940
Nat Micah dismisses the sound as just ultimately the demonic entity

128
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.320
escalates its attack,

129
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.190
making itself fully known by literally destroying the house in paranormal

130
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:25.370
activity. The entity cracks Micah and cages photographs,

131
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.330
and in paranormal activity to be entities completely destroyed. The house.

132
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.520
<v 3>Furniture is damage. My daughter Allie's room master bedroom.</v>

133
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.100
Yeah. So that's great.

134
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.120
<v 0>Even worse. There's no way to get rid of it. Not even a renowned ghost.</v>

135
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:44.380
Psychic can help Micah and Katie. He takes one step into the house. And then,

136
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.160
well.

137
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.560
<v 3>In fact, I've got to get out of here. This thing is very aggravated.</v>

138
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.600
<v 0>The home simply isn't safe anymore.</v>

139
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.640
<v 3>I can't, I can't be. I can't just, let's go. Please. Let's call paranormal.</v>

140
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.740
<v 0>Woody's depiction of the home. Somewhat.</v>

141
00:07:56.741 --> 00:08:00.940
Coincidentally reflects the growing anxiety around housing in the lead up to the

142
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:02.890
great recession. In 2007,

143
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:06.550
the housing bubble started to burst as millions of American households with

144
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.720
subprime loans found themselves unable to pay their mortgage. That year alone,

145
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:14.200
there were over 2.3 million foreclosures. The homes,

146
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:18.310
people thought were their safe Haven suddenly became their undoing per film

147
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:19.630
historian James Stone,

148
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.160
the paranormal activity films track the gradual collapse of the economic dream.

149
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.030
The business of the demon is to lay waste to materialist splendor.

150
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.180
Each movie takes place in a sizeable well-appointed home,

151
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.830
and then it all comes crashing down. Stone goes on to cite paranormal activity.

152
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.620
Two specifically in the film, one of the protagonists,

153
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.090
Allie discovers her family's ancestors had made a bargain to become wealthy by

154
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:45.100
forfeiting the sole of their firstborns.

155
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.550
<v 3>What if Christie's great-grandmother made a deal with a demon so she could get</v>

156
00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:48.910
rich.

157
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.040
<v 0>However, because the deal was never fulfilled.</v>

158
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.890
The demons stuck to the family until another son was born thus demon attacks

159
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.820
because their family quite simply hasn't paid their debt as stone rights.

160
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.050
The demon is an agent of the recession because he claims and destroys domestic

161
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:06.480
space and like even addictive creditor.

162
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.700
The monster begins his campaign of terror.

163
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.190
After a deal is reneged upon Blumhouse.

164
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:15.330
His later films insidious and sinister go even further showing that it isn't

165
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:17.970
just a singular home or family that is tainted,

166
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:23.010
but potentially every household insidious opens much like paranormal activity to

167
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.370
pick thing a seemingly ideal home at the opening credits show.

168
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:28.560
Something's wrong, right? From the outset,

169
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.110
we see still photographs of a beautiful house,

170
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.170
a family having just moved in yet in many of the shots,

171
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:36.780
pictures and chairs move on their own. Sure enough.

172
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.110
It's not long before the family realizes they're in a haunted house.

173
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.550
<v 4>I'm scared of this house. There's something wrong with this place.</v>

174
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.810
I'm not imagining it. I can feel it. It's. It's like a sickness.

175
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.630
<v 0>Prospect of being paranormally terrorized.</v>

176
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:54.320
The family does the only sensible thing they move. However,

177
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.960
despite moving to a new home, nothing changes,

178
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.500
they begin to experience the same ghostly hauntings. Yet again,

179
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.760
it turns out that the family's comatose son is a beacon for the supernatural

180
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:08.030
world, inviting the ghosts into the physical realm. Thus,

181
00:10:08.031 --> 00:10:11.300
no matter where they go, no home will ever be safe.

182
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.140
Their house will always be haunted. The same is true in sinister.

183
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.220
After a true crime novelist Ellison Oswald discovers his new home may be haunted

184
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:21.380
by a demonic entity. He yet again,

185
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:25.040
does the seemingly sensible thing getting the hell out yet,

186
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.380
as it turns out the entity haunting the house,

187
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.100
but Google is a demonic parasite that travels from home to home.

188
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.160
<v 5>Mr. Oswald, you just moved out of the last house in line.</v>

189
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.880
If this guy is still out there, you not only just sped up his timeline,

190
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.270
you put yourself in it.

191
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.060
<v 0>Only after a family moves,</v>

192
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:44.690
that beagle is able to possess the youngest to kill the rest of the family.

193
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.310
Thus by moving Ellison has inadvertently placed himself and his family in mortal

194
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:49.820
danger,

195
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.560
both insidious and sinister reject the notion of a singular haunted house in the

196
00:10:54.561 --> 00:10:58.670
traditional haunted house film. As long as you escape the house, you're safe.

197
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.960
However, in both insidious and sinister, the haunting follows the family.

198
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.060
Fleeing does nothing to solve the problem.

199
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.300
And in fact may spell your doom and it's not just the home,

200
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:09.590
but the entire neighborhood.

201
00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:13.910
That's no longer safe in the early 1980s and amid public concerns around crime

202
00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:17.450
rates. A new form of living began to sprout up across the country,

203
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.950
the gated community in ed Blakely and Mary Gail Snyder's fortress America.

204
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.340
They detailed how Americans were increasingly choosing to move to these

205
00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:27.380
supposedly safer communities.

206
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.940
As they write Americans of all classes are fording up attempting to secure the

207
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.110
value of their houses,

208
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.280
reduce or escape from the impact of crime and find neighbors who share their

209
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:39.410
sense of the good life in the purge.

210
00:11:39.411 --> 00:11:41.900
The logic of the gated community is made extreme.

211
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.010
It's no longer one secured neighborhood that keeps one safe from outsiders,

212
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:50.840
but an individual's house turned fortress. The Sandins live in an ideal, bright,

213
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:54.280
suburban neighborhood where everyone knows your it's the type of place where

214
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:56.440
your neighbors even bake you homemade cookies.

215
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.250
The Sandins have a deluxe security system that is supposedly foolproof in

216
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:02.680
protecting them from the violence of the outside world.

217
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.860
As such the family believes they are completely safe on purpose.

218
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.020
<v 3>I know bad things do happen tonight, but we can afford protection.</v>

219
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.600
So we'll be fine. Just like always no worries. Okay.

220
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.471
<v 0>However,</v>

221
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:17.040
the Sandins are so focused on protecting themselves from the outside world.

222
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.760
They failed to realize the actual threat is within their own community.

223
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.520
It's not some other it's their neighbors.

224
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.450
The same that gave them the delightful treats, the gated community of the purge.

225
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.640
Isn't the safe Haven from the outside world.

226
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.400
It's the nexus from which violence originates. Similarly, get out in virtue.

227
00:12:34.401 --> 00:12:38.700
The idea of these safe suburbs by opening with a black man, a quote unquote,

228
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.930
outsider lost and scared amongst the white middle-class affluence.

229
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.590
<v 3>Creepy, confusing, suburban</v>

230
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.130
girls serious though, like a sore thumb.

231
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.900
<v 0>And sure enough, his paranoia approves, right?</v>

232
00:12:57.901 --> 00:13:01.200
When he's quickly abducted in the middle of all the perfectly cut grass,

233
00:13:01.201 --> 00:13:04.290
matching driveways and brightly lit homes get out.

234
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.040
It does away with the very pretense of safety in the suburbs. Instead,

235
00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:13.020
the suburban home is something to escape to get out from when Chris arrives at

236
00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:16.470
his girlfriend's family home, he immediately notices something is wrong.

237
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.790
It may seem like the typical suburban ideal, but underneath something is amiss.

238
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.300
Chris sees that the only black people in the house are servants and that they're

239
00:13:24.301 --> 00:13:27.300
acting off later when there's a party at the house,

240
00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:30.480
he realizes that nearly everyone there is white and staring at him.

241
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.010
<v 3>Like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work.</v>

242
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.180
<v 0>Of course it turns out Chris's girlfriend is part of a weird brain transplanting</v>

243
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:39.570
Colt,

244
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.380
and that Christine's do kill each member of the household to finally get out in

245
00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:47.520
the end Chris's friend, rod surmises the entire film in one offhand joke.

246
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.700
I may have told you not to go in the house, get out. And the purge, Mark,

247
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.670
a shift in how Blumhouse films present the home.

248
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.660
Whereas early Blumhouse films focused on how seemingly idealistic homes and

249
00:13:57.661 --> 00:14:01.260
neighborhoods are no longer safe, corrupted by unseen monsters.

250
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.680
These later films present the home as symbiotic with the monster.

251
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.410
It's not that the Armitage family has corrupted in.

252
00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:11.700
Otherwise the nice suburb they're evil is one in the same in Jordan peals,

253
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:12.690
follow up us,

254
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.710
the Wilsons and upwardly mobile black family take a trip to their summer home in

255
00:14:16.711 --> 00:14:19.320
an upper-class beach side community. And yet again,

256
00:14:19.321 --> 00:14:20.820
something doesn't feel right,

257
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.900
but this time it isn't that everyone else is out to get them it's themselves.

258
00:14:24.901 --> 00:14:25.920
They have to worry about.

259
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.510
<v 3>I can't be here. It's too much.</v>

260
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:35.460
It feels like there's this some black

261
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.563
cloud.

262
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.080
<v 0>It's not too soon thereafter that the family is attacked by their doppelgangers</v>

263
00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:42.600
resentful of their other halves, posh lifestyle.

264
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:47.903
<v 3>Give it to her.</v>

265
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.100
The message behind us boils down to what does the.

266
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.600
<v 0>Dream of upward mobility of suburban bliss actually mean for everyone else who</v>

267
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:58.400
gets to live in a house and conversely,

268
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.000
who doesn't the literal real estate occupied by the Wilson family.

269
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:06.020
And others means a cast of people who are relegated to living below ground.

270
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.460
Outside of that dream.

271
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.300
The basic question of the film posits are there casualties in our quest for the

272
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.200
American dream.

273
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.130
The idea that homes can twist us beyond recognition by Adelaide for getting,

274
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:20.180
she actually came from the underground is a recurrent theme in later Blumhouse

275
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:23.570
films in get out. If Chris stays with the Armitage's in their home,

276
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.670
he will forever live in the sunken place.

277
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.990
And then Blumhouse is the invisible man Cecilia confides that she had to escape

278
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:33.590
her home because she didn't feel like herself there under her abusive husband's

279
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:36.110
thumb. She was becoming a different version of herself.

280
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.990
<v 3>He controlled how I looked and what I wore</v>

281
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.790
and what I eat.

282
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.130
<v 0>Similarly in Blumhouse is Halloween sequel.</v>

283
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.130
Laurie's daughter comments that she had to get away from her mother and their

284
00:15:48.131 --> 00:15:50.320
house less. She ended up just like her.

285
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:55.450
<v 3>I've spent my entire life praying to get over the paranoia and</v>

286
00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:57.120
neuroses that she has projected.

287
00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.500
<v 0>Later when Laurie kills Michael Myers,</v>

288
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.320
she does so not by expunging the boogeyman from the home,

289
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.670
but by trapping him inside the home now becomes a literal prison.

290
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.970
Just this year, Blumhouse released their latest film. You should have left,

291
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:10.541
which not.

292
00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:13.870
So coincidentally it's about a family trapped in a house which refuses to let

293
00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:16.120
them leave. Somehow Blumhouse has yet again,

294
00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:19.960
tapped into the zeitgeists at a time when people are stuck self isolating in

295
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:20.740
their homes.

296
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.490
This new film reflects these same fears from the company's inception.

297
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:28.540
Blumhouse has pressingly reflected the current client, often spookily,

298
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:31.930
predicting what's to come listen to our new founding fathers.

299
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.000
<v 3>And America, a nation reborn.</v>

300
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.630
<v 0>From the economic crisis of the early aughts to today's quarantined blues.</v>

301
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.270
How has Blumhouse been so consistently on point,

302
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.760
it was just a result of their cheapo business model,

303
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.880
or if they made some frosty and deal with the devil themselves.

304
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.680
<v 3>It has been said that if a human makes a bargain with a demon for wealth power</v>

305
00:16:50.681 --> 00:16:54.130
or any other benefit, they must forfeit their first born man.

306
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.600
<v 0>Regardless, the result is the same Blumhouse has captured the American home,</v>

307
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:03.310
like no other twisting the place, which we spend the most time into our undoing.

308
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.510
So wisecrack,

309
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.990
what do you think has Blumhouse made you afraid of your house or do you

310
00:17:07.991 --> 00:17:10.720
foolishly still sleep soundly at night?

311
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.140
Let us know in the comments below huge thanks to our patrons for all your
