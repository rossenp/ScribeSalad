00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.000
<v 1>What's up guys, Michael, here to talk about.</v>

2
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.093
<v 0>That's right.</v>

3
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.510
<v 1>Rugrats would have Nickelodeon's most beloved 90 shows ensure the antics of</v>

4
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:18.290
Tommy and the gang are endearing, but when it comes to overthinking a kid show,

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.910
one thing really stood out to us,

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.680
their parents that's because if we do the very complicated arithmetic,

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.760
these nineties parents are the embodiment of the Internet's favorite object of

8
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:33.050
ridicule boomers. What's more they're boomers raising millennial children,

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.090
even if the little tykes weren't called that yet.

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.300
And once you start to think about the show from that perspective,

11
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:40.130
a certain shift in meaning occurs,

12
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.210
because what if we can understand a generation of people obsessed with anxiety

13
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.690
means and what Harry Potter house they belong to through this story of their

14
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:48.440
parents.

15
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.280
Let us explain in this wisecrack edition on rug rats and the rise of boomer

16
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:57.020
parents, and now for the briefest of recaps rug, rats, as you know, spotlights,

17
00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:00.920
a playgroup of babies and toddlers, the core original group consists of Tommy,

18
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:04.130
the idealistic leader, Chucky, the perpetual worrywart,

19
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.300
Phil and Lil the warm love and sweeties and Angelica, the bratty bully.

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.630
When their parents leave the room, their imaginations go wild,

21
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.220
leading them on many fanciful,

22
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:17.330
occasionally horrifying adventures for context Rugrats debuted in

23
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:18.500
1991.

24
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.680
And while the eighties and nineties are often remembered as a time of relative

25
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:22.490
prosperity,

26
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.840
it also was a time of widening economic inequality and a rapidly shrinking

27
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.370
middle-class. As a result,

28
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.660
many baby boomers entered full on adulthood slash Parenthood and a state of very

29
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:36.200
real economic anxiety. They were faced with demanding mortgage payments,

30
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.990
stagnating wages, and a known Raveling social safety net,

31
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.900
which to be fair all still are things today.

32
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.120
These anxieties manifest in the pickles,

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.010
particularly in the early seasons D constantly worries about money saying things

34
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.460
like.

35
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.380
<v 2>I think going over our bills still.</v>

36
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.530
And I thought maybe if you've got a job outside the house.

37
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.850
<v 1>Grocery shop to the calculator to avoid an unexpectedly high tech.</v>

38
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.320
<v 2>And don't forget the calculator pop and we're on a budget. Remember here.</v>

39
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.560
<v 1>DD reflects the reality of being a boomer during this era,</v>

40
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.770
a reality described by journalists and Helen Peterson's book.

41
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.710
Can't even how millennials became the burnout generation.

42
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.010
Peterson looks at the plight of the stressed out millennials starting with the

43
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.360
trajectory of their boomer parents born between 1946 and 1964.

44
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.170
Baby boomers entered the world during the relative prosperity of the post-war

45
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.040
economic boom.

46
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.240
America had a robust social safety net and middle-class workers could generally

47
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:33.110
rely on the supportive labor unions for those greatest generation parents,

48
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.550
even a blue collar union job promised to middle-class Gloria,

49
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:39.410
along with the ability to buy a house and provide for your family,

50
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.530
including your crying boomer, baby, a scholar, Louis Hyman,

51
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:44.990
put it capitalism worked for nearly everyone,

52
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.570
but over the course of the next several decades,

53
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:49.250
the rise of what political scientist,

54
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:52.460
Jacob hacker calls the personal responsibility per se,

55
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.750
remolded American culture into one where increasingly people were left on their

56
00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:59.830
own to succeed or fail without the help GI bills,

57
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.650
generous social security checks or a good union job.

58
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.210
As a result of boomers became a grownups in increasingly uncertain economic

59
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:11.050
times when maintaining a middle-class lifestyle is becoming harder and harder.

60
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.200
And for some people that worked out really, really well,

61
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.010
especially if you had no moral qualms about selling junk stocks on wall street,

62
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.640
greed is.

63
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.520
<v 3>Right. Greed works.</v>

64
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.460
<v 1>And for everyone else, it was a huge bummer.</v>

65
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.020
One that Rugrats may have accidentally documented in cartoon form. For example,

66
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.501
Tommy's,

67
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:33.640
dad's stew faces the constant pressure of operating a small business in a

68
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:34.474
ruthless economy.

69
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.310
<v 2>Still, honey, I'm worried about you. I think you've been working too hard on it.</v>

70
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.560
<v 1>The pressure stoop faces manifests physically fill sleepwalk or be caught</v>

71
00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:46.770
talking to himself in a state of over exhaustion. And one episode,

72
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:48.210
Tommy fancifully wonders.

73
00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:52.950
If his dad is secretly a robot and Stu stress do sleepwalking confirms his

74
00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:53.731
fears here,

75
00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:57.600
we see Tommy accurately perceiving the way economic anxiety weighs on his

76
00:03:57.601 --> 00:04:01.740
father. At another point, Chuckie, similarly relays, his father's own concerns.

77
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.360
<v 2>My daddy Sadie's afraid the bosses coulda fire here.</v>

78
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.540
<v 1>So what happened is baby boomers adjusted to a new,</v>

79
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:13.890
more cutthroat normal as Peterson describes it, the generation of weed, token,

80
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.090
hippie protesters evolve from being more socially minded agitators to becoming

81
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.480
increasingly insular or as economist Mathias, dukkha,

82
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:25.320
and for breezy Mozilla body put it. They decided to look out for themselves.

83
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.890
They invested more in their education and individual success while deaning

84
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:30.510
social protection, less important.

85
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.900
Anyone who seen rug rats could perceive this cutthroat mentality and the

86
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:35.910
character of Angelica's mom, Charlotte,

87
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.380
the incessantly cell phone chatting business woman and CEO of the very ominous

88
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:43.350
sounding Megacorp. Charlotte's known for saying things like.

89
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.870
<v 2>The junk bond market is coming back. And I,</v>

90
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:49.350
for one intend to be in a position to take advantage of the tool.

91
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.850
<v 1>Her selfishness while played for laughs actually just exaggerates a very real</v>

92
00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:57.510
social and cultural shift that took place in the hearts and minds of many non

93
00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:59.850
cartoon boomers. Long before you were telling me.

94
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.790
<v 3>Old lady suck, okay.</v>

95
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.410
<v 1>Now his boomers became increasingly focused on the self and keeping that self</v>

96
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.720
economically, socially and physically successful.

97
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.240
They were vying to maintain middle-class steps.

98
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.000
This new mentality resulted in the rise of the yuppie.

99
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.910
That is the special brand of college educated boomer,

100
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:21.810
who according to Peterson can basically be defined by their lavish consumption

101
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.670
habits, their gadgets, or vacations or French sparkling wine. Also preludes.

102
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.840
According to Peterson,

103
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.750
the yuppie mentality took form over the course of the seventies,

104
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.770
metastasized in the eighties and became the base temperature of the nineties and

105
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:35.610
make no mistake.

106
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.570
The rug rats parents may be some of the happiest yuppies ever to yuppie as the

107
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.330
LA times noted in a 1998 review of the show,

108
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.200
particularly in early seasons of the parents are hyper concerned with projecting

109
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:47.034
prosperity.

110
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.340
<v 2>Pop-up show for one year. Why not a little France?</v>

111
00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:52.860
Aren't even gonna remember it. They'll remember this one,

112
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:55.530
pop rated number one by birthdays magazine.

113
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:58.250
And besides do we want to be remembered the family that settled.

114
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.240
<v 0>For less, they are.</v>

115
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.010
<v 1>Super consumption, happy lusting after boats and fancy golf clubs,</v>

116
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.380
they filmed their banal vacations on their camcorder.

117
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.350
<v 0>There's there's D packing for our vacation to the grand Canyon</v>

118
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.540
and obsess over healthy.

119
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.600
<v 2>Don't order. The many junk food or out take your time.</v>

120
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.350
<v 1>They take their hobbies seriously and present their new neighbors with</v>

121
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:24.580
decorative jello molds and throw nightmare inducing, costume parties galore.

122
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.630
Occasionally they even rent a limo buses to show off for their friends.

123
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.080
<v 2>We even rented a limo bus to celebrate Steve's.</v>

124
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.780
<v 1>Big night. Of course, there are moments of reprieve from their yuckiness,</v>

125
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.830
the dueling realities of the boomer identity between flower child and sharper

126
00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:41.440
image. Loving yuppie comes to a head in the second season.

127
00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:45.010
When the pickles throw a garage sale to reduce bloated clutter of commodities.

128
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.780
<v 2>You got your five Jews, Sacha [inaudible] lamb from that old standby,</v>

129
00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:51.100
the pet rock, the chiller.

130
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.570
<v 1>We'll drink trying to be helpful.</v>

131
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.160
Move all the beloved belongings that the parents chose not to sell outside.

132
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.210
And the family ends up accidentally pawning off everything they own.

133
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.420
After a brief moment of panic upon seeing their empty house,

134
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.650
the pickles go full circle almost as if retreating to the antique consumption

135
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:11.350
ideals of the sixties, at least temporarily. I mean,

136
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:13.570
all we lost for material possessions.

137
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.910
<v 2>And what we've rediscovered are the important.</v>

138
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.590
<v 0>Things like family and.</v>

139
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.850
<v 2>And other human values, hell they eat.</v>

140
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.950
<v 0>And sing [inaudible].</v>

141
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.880
But for the most part, they stay in character, put a sock in at the.

142
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.120
<v 1>What else did boomer yuppies do? According to Peterson,</v>

143
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.970
surrounded by perceived threats and growing uncertainty.

144
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.900
Middle-class boomers doubled down on what they could try to control their

145
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:41.680
children.

146
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.640
And indeed nothing made boomers more crazy than the pressure to be good parents

147
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.410
and provide well for their spawn.

148
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.940
Early on the show sets this tone pretty clearly as DD panics over throwing the

149
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.810
perfect first birthday party for Tommy complete with a puppet show that no one

150
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:56.860
year old deserves.

151
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.990
<v 2>My future as a mother, depends on this party.</v>

152
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.130
And the party depends on the public.

153
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.851
<v 1>Contrast.</v>

154
00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:04.450
Her approach with Tommy's greatest generation grandpa who was raised in became a

155
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:06.100
parent than a more hands-off age.

156
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:11.170
<v 2>Why when I was a spot, we didn't have puppet shells and we wanted entertainment.</v>

157
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.750
We went out back and pulled up stops after.

158
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.910
<v 1>The puppet show fails, DD frats that.</v>

159
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.270
<v 2>I never live up to being the kind of mother I want to be. You know,</v>

160
00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.100
like those moms on TV here.

161
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.720
<v 1>D reflects the nearly omnipresent desire among boomers to be a model parent,</v>

162
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:28.210
and to perform that good Parenthood for the whole neighborhood.

163
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.680
She like many millennial parents who would come after her internalized a stress

164
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:35.770
inducing message that as sociologist Sharon Hayes put it,

165
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.970
the methods of appropriate child rearing are construed as child centered expert

166
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.710
guidance, emotionally absorbing labor intensive and financially expensive.

167
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.260
This pressure is encapsulated by DDS realization.

168
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.950
A few seasons later that she had abandoned her work on deals, baby book,

169
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.000
forever losing the chance to memorialize the first time he burped or pooped

170
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.040
pants, better.

171
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.290
<v 2>Baby book, and write that down. Woo.</v>

172
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.310
<v 1>Again, she feels like she's failed at the same time.</v>

173
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.470
Boomers worried about their child raising methods.

174
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.730
They became fixated on what sociologists and that Lareau calls concerted

175
00:09:10.731 --> 00:09:11.480
cultivation.

176
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.500
That is the process of carefully developing their children via cello lessons,

177
00:09:15.501 --> 00:09:19.160
expensive summer camps, and ensuring that they're trilingual by the age of 10.

178
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.790
But given the persistent economic anxiety that permeated the era,

179
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.770
these choices start to make more sense.

180
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.070
It was all in the pursuit of their desire to raise children who had maintained

181
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:30.350
their middle-class status. If they failed,

182
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.830
they feared their kids would grow up to be the lowly garbage collector who keeps

183
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:37.130
our neighborhoods clean rather than getting paid hundreds of thousands of

184
00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:41.270
dollars to do whatever the consultant does as Peterson puts it,

185
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.520
the child's wellbeing and more importantly,

186
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.340
their future capacity for success is paramount.

187
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.270
Deedee can barely get through a sentence without referring to her favorite child

188
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:55.040
expert. She obsesses over the minutia of how she rears Tommy.

189
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.650
<v 2>Diapers. Wipeys books, blankets, a cap,</v>

190
00:09:57.651 --> 00:10:00.860
a change of clothes band-aids in case of emergency and two extra bottles of

191
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.580
cheese.

192
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.010
<v 1>And takes him to maximum security daycare.</v>

193
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.930
The parents panic over bottle-feeding.

194
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.330
<v 2>So this boy that his parents didn't think it was important to wean him this</v>

195
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:14.060
child. Well, you get my point.

196
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.400
<v 1>They panic over running noses. I've tried.</v>

197
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.600
<v 2>Everything. Decongestants, herbal remedies, Chad D and boy.</v>

198
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.350
<v 1>Boy, do they panic over potty training with Chucky's dad, even Freddie. Now.</v>

199
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.040
<v 2>He's going to be taken diapers to work with limit his briefcase.</v>

200
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.030
<v 1>Here at Chaz is literally worrying about how his failure to potty train Chucky</v>

201
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:35.180
in a timely manner could be a threat to the mini Ginger's career.

202
00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:37.400
And therefore middle-class status.

203
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.120
The boomer need to carefully cultivate their child is best exemplified.

204
00:10:41.121 --> 00:10:45.170
In an episode of when Angelica takes up painting for a very yuppy reason.

205
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.060
<v 2>My personal shaman said it was absolutely the best way to nurture her creative</v>

206
00:10:50.061 --> 00:10:50.630
side.

207
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.240
<v 1>Immediately. Her mother praises her work saying.</v>

208
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:58.220
<v 2>I love it. The total abandonment of form,</v>

209
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.690
the disregard of balance it's so Jackson.

210
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.300
<v 1>Little does she know that this, um,</v>

211
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.320
abstract expressionism is actually the result of the baby's fooling around with

212
00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:12.050
paint. That's a nice touch, which maintains the rug. Rats,

213
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:16.640
Maxim that the best things happen when kids are just allowed to be kids it's

214
00:11:16.641 --> 00:11:20.420
worth noting that concerted cultivation also makes a prominent appearance and it

215
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.870
rug rats all grown up episode. When the kids panic over a fifth grade,

216
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:24.920
standardized test.

217
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.813
<v 2>Depends on his chest.</v>

218
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.630
<v 1>Meanwhile, Angelica's mom urges her to start worrying about her college resume,</v>

219
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.930
giving her 11 year old daughter, totally normal advice. Like you.

220
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.570
<v 2>Must do things that'll impress the college admissions office show concern for</v>

221
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:43.700
the environment, your fellow male.

222
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.570
<v 1>Well, the grand result of concerted cultivation was as Peterson puts it,</v>

223
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.850
that boomers raised in many adults,

224
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.560
millennials who quickly grew up and began mimicking the habits of adulthood,

225
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.070
cue excessive anxiety, fittingly the rug.

226
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:01.360
Rats are mini adults in a lot of ways, worried about living up to expectations.

227
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.930
<v 2>Well then go play in the sandbox. I care Chucky on my daddy went away.</v>

228
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.600
And once we had to be the man of the home.

229
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.380
<v 1>And worried like their parents about their own child develop, we.</v>

230
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.900
<v 2>Ain't going to be a big baby. Anyway, also.</v>

231
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.960
<v 1>Fittingly they're prone to suffering from real bouts of anxiety.</v>

232
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.620
Sometimes sounding like they have the weight of the world on their shoulders.

233
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.780
<v 2>Life is so hard. Copy.</v>

234
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.520
<v 1>Angelica for one becomes an expert at performing her parents' expectations of a</v>

235
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.570
perfect childhood.

236
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.100
<v 2>What difference does it make?</v>

237
00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:37.020
Who did what the impressing is that we're all here and we love each

238
00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:41.100
other after all family is really what matters. Right?

239
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:44.401
<v 1>Of course,</v>

240
00:12:44.401 --> 00:12:48.420
she simultaneously develops a low key diabolical alter ego that allows her to

241
00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:52.380
vent her pent up anger and frustration in the playpen. At the same time,

242
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:56.100
she seems to innately have picked up her mother's love of luxurious consumption,

243
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.510
a hankering best displayed when she harasses a mall Santa until he quits his

244
00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:05.370
job. So were the Rugrats always doomed to grow into the anxious, depressed,

245
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.880
burned out millennials that Peterson analyzes in her book, maybe,

246
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.290
but we wonder if their fate was really set in stone. And for one main reason,

247
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.460
the same reason that makes rug rats. So fun to watch. Unlike a lot of boomers,

248
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.540
the Rugrats folks are way too self-absorbed to be true helicopter parents.

249
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.230
That is to say their patented parenting move is to put the kids in the playpen

250
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.800
and F the hell off. This was perhaps out of narrative necessity,

251
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.170
a show about babies sitting on their parents' laps,

252
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:34.680
listening to classical music while learning to read at age two and a half is a

253
00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:37.410
lot less fun than a show about kids. We can have it.

254
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.530
We'll imagine themselves in outer space as a result of the rug,

255
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.690
rats get plenty of time to themselves,

256
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.610
away from their parents to Rosie's and paranoia's time to play, time to dream.

257
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.480
And that's something a lot of middle-class millennial kids didn't get much of

258
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.320
Peterson notes that working class millennial children whose working parents

259
00:13:55.321 --> 00:13:57.180
didn't have the luxury videotaping.

260
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.000
Their every burp often had a lot more free reign.

261
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.560
That meant more of what she calls natural growth or the conscious or unconscious

262
00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:08.490
allotment of unstructured time, which allows children to cultivate curiosity,

263
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.780
independence, and learn to negotiate peer dynamics on their own inadvertently,

264
00:14:12.781 --> 00:14:13.231
perhaps,

265
00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:17.070
and despite their very real anxiety and neuroses about raising their children,

266
00:14:17.071 --> 00:14:20.940
right? The regret's parents give them a lot of this unstructured time to do the

267
00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:25.050
important things like imagine themselves as pirates. This kind of play.

268
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:26.070
According to Peterson,

269
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.460
helps kids develop independence and a strong sense of self.

270
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.910
It also makes for good television. At the end of the day,

271
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.600
Rugrats is fascinating for its depiction of boomer parenting while also

272
00:14:36.601 --> 00:14:38.340
strategically leaving out one,

273
00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:42.690
all important tactic of boomer parents as Peterson puts it constant surveillance

274
00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:43.950
and protected childhood.

275
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.060
We think that may be part of the broad appeal of the show at a time when kids

276
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:52.490
increasingly had less licensed to goof around watching kids go on adventures,

277
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:55.880
reminiscent of a different era was extraordinarily appealing.

278
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.510
Perhaps there was some catharsis we might not have been allowed to play outside

279
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.290
and supervised,

280
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.670
but we got to watch the Rugrats build their own Noah's Ark in complete freedom.

281
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.280
But what do you guys think are the rads parents,

282
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.570
exemplary boomer parents with these lumpy babies have grown up to be depressed,

283
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:13.610
millennials, meaning their way through our current.
