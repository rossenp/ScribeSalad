00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.250
<v 0>This video is brought to you by keeps</v>

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.210
what's up. Wisecrack Michael here,

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.380
have you ever wondered if innovation and technology are ever going to backfire

4
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:14.580
and destroy humanity?

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.660
And just because science could do something incredible that it actually should

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.890
and once and for all,

7
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.450
can anyone explain the difference between animatronics and auto erotica? Well,

8
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.430
on this episode of the good, the bad and the brilliant,

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.420
we're going to try to answer these questions by breaking down the 1993 classic

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.920
Jurassic park and this film,

11
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.460
we see what happens when an eccentric billionaire plays God and brings dinosaurs

12
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.600
back to life. It does not go well. And to help me,

13
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:43.300
I am joined by TV writer and performer, Billy domino, Billy, how are you doing.

14
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.180
<v 1>Well? We've got, you know, the big pandemic outside,</v>

15
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.610
but in here we probably still also have the pandemic.

16
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:52.010
So it's good to be less than six feet away from you right now.

17
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.581
<v 0>It's good.</v>

18
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:56.330
It's good to know that someone statistically speaking in this tiny room that

19
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:58.790
we're in is probably infected.

20
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.970
<v 1>Does that ruin the magic of this? To know that this was shot in a room?</v>

21
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:05.930
Like where people, assuming we exist in this neutral space, it just has some,

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.850
you know, primary colored props behind it. Yeah.

23
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.481
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I,</v>

24
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.480
I think we think of it as like the movie interstellar where we find the fifth

25
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.270
dimension that this room is a sort of fifth dimension or time in space coalesced

26
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:17.104
into this corner.

27
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.210
<v 1>I haven't actually seen interstellar that's McConaughey. Right?</v>

28
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.870
So I've seen a Lincoln commercial and I'm going to take whatever lessons I've

29
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:25.850
learned from that and say that was interstellar.

30
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.570
<v 0>It's similar to that. I think, I think Lincoln guy,</v>

31
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:33.710
Matthew McConaughey starts in interstellar and that character is the one in

32
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:34.190
those commercials.

33
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.350
<v 1>It's possible. Uh, Lincoln guy,</v>

34
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.820
Matthew McConaughey got paid more than interstellar guy, Matthew McConaughey.

35
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.100
<v 0>Oh, that's probably true. So to get started,</v>

36
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.230
let's talk about what's good in this movie.

37
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.620
So give us something what's something you think is good about Jurassic park.

38
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.053
<v 1>Script.</v>

39
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.860
This movie occupies so much space in my brain for so long.

40
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.600
I've been thinking about it either consciously or unconsciously for 27

41
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:00.434
years now.

42
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.640
And I can not think of a more robust screenplay that ties up every loose

43
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.770
and that uses everything it puts into play and makes it meaningful.

44
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.360
Nothing is wasted.

45
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:15.860
It's so efficient and everything has a very big emotional

46
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:16.520
payoff.

47
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.260
The first thing that comes to mind there for me is all the ways that they start

48
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.740
to hint that, okay, this park is actually not.

49
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:27.410
What it seems to be is not. It is not as sleek.

50
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:29.120
It is not as well run as you think it is.

51
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.110
You're getting constant hints throughout it. And it starts in such a small way.

52
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.970
When Donald Genero, the lawyer, the bad guy,

53
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:41.330
if there is one of this entire movie, he goes to the mind to, you know,

54
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:44.300
talk to the Amber minors. He gets off this little barge.

55
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.790
He starts walking to the mind and gear. It's totally unacceptable.

56
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.070
And in the middle of talking about this pain lawsuit,

57
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:50.600
he says the insurance company,

58
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.280
and then he slips on the dirt and he falls down the moment.

59
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:59.060
The conversation turns to money and not about the safety and logistics.

60
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.960
And should we, or should we not be building this park?

61
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.800
That is when suddenly things start to go awry in the smallest way.

62
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.440
And throughout that, we start to get all these little hints of note to note,

63
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:09.550
this is not right. This is not.

64
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.880
<v 0>Yeah. And I think the whole opening,</v>

65
00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:16.290
probably 10 minutes of the film as we bounced to all of our main characters is

66
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:20.700
so good at setting the stakes for who these people are, what they care about,

67
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.120
how they might eventually bounce off each other. We get the iconic scene of,

68
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:28.260
of Dr. Grant teaching a young child on a dig site about why we need to take

69
00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:31.740
philosophy Raptors. Seriously. I do wonder why the child is there.

70
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.240
<v 1>I've always worked from a place of, okay, you see Dr. Grant he's at the screen,</v>

71
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:37.800
which he shouldn't touch, but he does touch it.

72
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.830
You can't control him and behavior. You know, so humans are the variable,

73
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:43.410
not the dinosaurs, but look behind him.

74
00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:46.530
And you see a lot of extras doing some really hardcore face acting,

75
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:48.930
knowing that this is a big budget thing we're going to get on screen.

76
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:52.710
This is our chance. I've always assumed they are essentially dyno tourists.

77
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.190
They're coming to volunteer at the dig site and help out someone brought their

78
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.740
pudgy little boy along. And he's, you know,

79
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.600
starting to be his own little Dennis, the menace,

80
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.420
he's trying to make a name for himself as well. He has an agent.

81
00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:04.260
The boy needs to eat.

82
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:06.630
His parents are going to squander the money that he gets from this film.

83
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.890
That's what child acting is.

84
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.990
I love the moment that we have with him when he goes from Turkey to he's very

85
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:14.040
scared. He's like, yeah, no,

86
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:18.750
I should give this dinosaur respect because it's 90% fear and

87
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:21.120
10% me, daddy, like I,

88
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:24.420
and there's so much sexual awakening for everyone in this movie,

89
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:27.030
no matter who your favorite star of it is like, I mean,

90
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.900
I am dressed as Laura Durance now I just happen to have this.

91
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.990
<v 0>I will say you were the first guest on the show.</v>

92
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.180
Who's ever taking things seriously enough to have a tire that relates to

93
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:39.690
the film.

94
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.190
<v 1>I would argue I'm the first guest.</v>

95
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:44.280
That's unemployed enough to be able to go down that road to have the time to

96
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:47.220
think about how Penn would Mount sambal together. That said, I pray,

97
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.880
I'll take the call.

98
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.520
<v 0>That was underneath what I was saying, but I tried to have the positive gloss.</v>

99
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:51.600
But speaking of your outfit,

100
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.720
something I love about this movie and a thing I didn't notice as a kid that I

101
00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:58.170
noticed now, Laura Dern's performance is really phenomenal.

102
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.150
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

103
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.600
<v 1>As a, I saw this for the first time. I was four years old when it came out.</v>

104
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.900
So I couldn't, I was too young to go see it in the theaters. But you know,

105
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.150
when it came on video, my dad brought home.

106
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:19.260
We watched it and it was a sexual awakening. First of all, I will say that,

107
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.250
but it wasn't sexual on top of my brain. Like I would like to kiss Laura dirt.

108
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.270
It was just like, that is what a nice wife is. Like,

109
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:32.130
that's the process my brain went through and it informed all of my

110
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.970
future sexual thinking up until the time I saw like Daria five years later,

111
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:37.980
and then like, Oh, maybe that at least first.

112
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.850
<v 2>I'm not miserable. I'm just not like them.</v>

113
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.980
<v 0>I wish that I was a licensed psychotherapist.</v>

114
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.920
Cause I would love to go through the journey of Laura Dern, Andrew asset park,

115
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:50.160
being the entry into sexualized fantasizing,

116
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.020
and then Daria an animated outsider picking up that mantle.

117
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.790
This is all very interesting stuff. Well,

118
00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:59.150
what's another thing that stands out to you as being good.

119
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.740
<v 1>Or movie that is all about spectacle.</v>

120
00:06:02.741 --> 00:06:05.620
At least when you're pitching it and you're selling to an audience, you know,

121
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.620
we're going to see dinosaurs. And for the first time in movie history,

122
00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:11.740
they're going to look good and real. And they're going to have this.

123
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.910
They're going to bring about this amazing emotional reaction from you.

124
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:19.990
The audience, it is grounded in so many intricate,

125
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.550
emotional arcs. You have the most prominent one is Dr. Grant going from,

126
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.690
we were talking about, you know,

127
00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:29.890
six foot Turkey kid and him being very aggressive and wanting to stave off the

128
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:34.090
idea of fatherhood and maturity and having to potentially put aside, you know,

129
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.530
bachelorhood style dreams. He goes from having the Raptor, claw out.

130
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.470
His knives are out. And then by the time we get to the end of,

131
00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:42.760
I think this is a five act movie.

132
00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:44.950
I'll make that argument at the end of act three,

133
00:06:44.951 --> 00:06:49.090
when we're going up into the tree, he sits down out. I hurt my.

134
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.600
It's because of the claw. Oh, my insecurities are holding me back.

135
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.880
I'm going to get rid of my insecurities and move on with my life.

136
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.230
<v 0>That's great. And then even the,</v>

137
00:06:56.231 --> 00:07:01.120
I think the final time we see him in the movie is with Tim and Lex asleep on his

138
00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.370
shoulders, in the helicopter.

139
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.410
<v 1>And where does he look to? He looks out and he sees birds.</v>

140
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.470
Birds are dinosaurs in his brain. And he realizes, Oh yes,

141
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:11.770
I have to give up the Peter pan fantasy of living in dinosaur land,

142
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.540
but I can always take it with me.

143
00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:16.540
And I'm still going to be me at my core as a bird is still a dinosaur.

144
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.991
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:19.810
And this has made me think I wrote something down that felt ludicrous as I was

146
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:21.070
writing it, but I want to defend.

147
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:24.580
Now there's something symphonic about the movie in which all these

148
00:07:24.581 --> 00:07:28.660
interconnected parts always hit at the right moment. Come together.

149
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.600
Not when you think they should, but when they actually should, as well.

150
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.490
<v 1>I was using the word symphonic F first of all,</v>

151
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:36.250
is it okay that I'm waving this pen around? This feels like violence.

152
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:40.090
As I'm like throwing it back and forth. I do feel threatened. Great.

153
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.920
This is the first time as a child that I ever cared about music in a

154
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:48.910
film to this day. I think it is the greatest film score I've ever heard.

155
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.710
You have the Nana, that's the main theme. You have the adventure theme, duh,

156
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.090
duh, duh.

157
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.960
And then you have the rafter theme as well for the moments of extreme danger.

158
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:00.790
I don't even know the notes to that one.

159
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.700
The main theme I will argue to this day,

160
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.400
it's the perfect thing to walk down the aisle to in fact,

161
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:11.440
a former partner stole that from me. It's okay.

162
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:14.530
Understand you liked a good idea. That's fine. You know what? It wasn't for it.

163
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:18.280
Wasn't for me to say whether my future wife will, you know, we'll use that. Um,

164
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.000
we'll say that is one piece of music where it's just like, Oh,

165
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.130
I want to go on this journey right now.

166
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.320
It's this beautifully sad melancholic piece of it

167
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:33.400
is you are listening to a beautiful dream and the notes and are constantly mind

168
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:36.220
you that this is so wonderful. And yes, it is a dream.

169
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:40.390
This can never be had it's in the past, but try if you want to, you know,

170
00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:43.150
go through that, that emotional heartbreak you're well,

171
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.380
you're welcome to remember the dream.

172
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.700
<v 0>Yeah. Now I feel like we could go on with the good for this for quite some time,</v>

173
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.680
I'm going to hit a couple of things real quick.

174
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:52.210
You can agree or disagree before we end this,

175
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.490
the CGI and animatronics 27 years old holdup, doesn't take you out of it.

176
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.630
I also think it's cool that this movie got an entire generation largely.

177
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:04.050
I'm sure our generation excited about dinosaurs and into science.

178
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.080
And I also think through the eyes of the children, the movie,

179
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.200
and this is a very Spielberg thing, captures a sense of childlike,

180
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:12.900
wonder in a way that doesn't feel forced or gimmicky.

181
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.970
And I think that really catches you in the film.

182
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.480
<v 1>Who's watching. This probably has seen it multiple times.</v>

183
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.690
It's probably been many years since you saw it. The first time,

184
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:26.000
it is hard to overstate the magnitude of the shot when Dr. Grant and

185
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.100
Ellie first see the BRACA sores,

186
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.030
because it's both for the audience and Dr. Grant are going through the same

187
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:35.030
thing there for Dr. Grant. It is not just, Oh, here's a dream.

188
00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:37.940
I've had my entire life, but I'll probably never get it.

189
00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:41.150
Like if your dream was to make a billion dollars, yes, it's possible,

190
00:09:41.151 --> 00:09:43.190
but it's not going to happen, but it's still possible.

191
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.730
This is a dream he has always had and always accepted will never come true.

192
00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:51.500
And now you just broke his brain and his heart by saying, actually surprise.

193
00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:54.890
This can be real. And you know, on a much smaller level,

194
00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:56.750
I don't think audiences had ever anticipated,

195
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.700
seen a dinosaur that looks so right.

196
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.380
<v 0>Perfect time to put a little bow on our good discussion and transition to the</v>

197
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.270
bed. So what is something that you find bad about your part,

198
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.440
but before we continue, I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor keeps,

199
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.620
did you know that two out of three guys will experience some form of male

200
00:10:15.621 --> 00:10:18.410
pattern baldness by the time they're 35, it sucks.

201
00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:22.160
And unfortunately avoiding the sun wearing hats or cutting down on shower time,

202
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.060
doesn't stop it.

203
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.290
Still prevention is the key and keeps treatments work to help you keep your

204
00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:29.840
hair. The sooner you start, the more hair you will save.

205
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.000
66% of men even experienced hair.

206
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:35.960
Regrowth keeps us revolutionize the way men are treated for hair loss with keeps

207
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.450
it's easier and more affordable to get treatment.

208
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.470
They offer products that are FDA approved and available over the counter or with

209
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.130
the prescription.

210
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.640
You simply visit a doctor online and get the medication delivered right to your

211
00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:48.380
home. It's so simple and easy.

212
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.420
So if you're noticing hair loss and they're stressing,

213
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.550
do something about it for a limited time,

off your first order. Now, back to the show.

216
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.400
<v 1>First thing I'll say,</v>

217
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.360
and this is a critique of Spielberg movies more in general than is this one

218
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.310
we're lacking moral ambiguity.

219
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.000
Even though there is a whole question throughout this of, is it right?

220
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.190
Is it wrong to bring back dinosaurs?

221
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.010
Is it right to think that we can possibly control them?

222
00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:18.710
Or is it utter folly from the beginning in the end,

223
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.780
the answers are all pretty clear to that.

224
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.730
Or at least the answers to the movie presents to us.

225
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.360
And we know where characters fall. It's not pure black and white,

226
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.310
but it is a very linear spectrum.

227
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.310
And I'd love some extra dimensionality or some ambiguity there.

228
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:33.980
That could be fun. That said, I don't even know if I wanted,

229
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:35.600
would that make it a totally different movie? Yeah.

230
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.550
<v 0>Yeah, no, I think, I think you're right there.</v>

231
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:39.950
This is so much more minor than that.

232
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.410
Something that I think is bad or questionable,

233
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.060
a crazy old billionaire invites his grandchildren to test out a

234
00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:47.930
dinosaur park.

235
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.220
Like he doesn't think let's get some weird employees or like pay some orphans,

236
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.230
his own blood. He wants them to be the test subjects.

237
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.110
Like what did he tell his children that sent them?

238
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.690
Like if child protective services heard about this, what would happen?

239
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:03.910
And they're in an international situation as well.

240
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.840
I think that's kind of reckless and I can't, I can't help. But think about that.

241
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.120
<v 1>I think about that a lot too. And there are two sides to it. One is the,</v>

242
00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:13.980
I don't believe it. And I'm with you on that.

243
00:12:13.981 --> 00:12:16.350
I think he's smart enough to know this is not the time.

244
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.740
Although they do set up the idea of his daughter is getting a divorce.

245
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.140
So he's clearly just trying to take their minds off. It.

246
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.110
<v 3>Have to leave early. He wants to be with his daughter, she's getting a divorce.</v>

247
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.360
<v 1>So what he Hammond lacks at all times is a respect</v>

248
00:12:30.361 --> 00:12:33.570
for the variables he's introducing into this equation.

249
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.280
He doesn't recognize that just by brain into extra bodies that is going to

250
00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:40.380
have different effects on the system as well.

251
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.431
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

252
00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:44.520
I'm glad they're there because Tim and Lex bring a lot to the film. Uh,

253
00:12:44.521 --> 00:12:47.820
the only other thing, and this is in a similar boat that I don't like so much,

254
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.350
this staff seems kind of dumb.

255
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.100
<v 3>Is he dilated? You should know this.</v>

256
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.620
<v 1>I'm confused about that side has to, does he,</v>

257
00:12:55.621 --> 00:12:57.750
after dropping her back at the compound,

258
00:12:57.751 --> 00:13:01.380
does he then get to the boat in time or is he just in his own little bunker the

259
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:04.230
whole time? I feel like he disappears, honestly. Yeah.

260
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:06.060
Why is he just assuming again,

261
00:13:06.061 --> 00:13:10.260
everyone says there is a problem on this Island that overall comes back to the

262
00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:11.100
good side of this.

263
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.290
Everyone assumes that the dinosaurs and the employees will behave

264
00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:18.720
lawfully and they just assume no, no,

265
00:13:18.721 --> 00:13:21.360
that won't be a problem because we hope it won't be.

266
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.920
And it's just another way that we learn, okay, no, this park is not control.

267
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:28.170
I'm not like this goes back to that earlier point I was making.

268
00:13:28.171 --> 00:13:31.920
But during the Mr. DNA sequence, the best exposition in any movie of all time,

269
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.620
period, they scientists decide, no,

270
00:13:34.621 --> 00:13:38.040
we want to get off the ride now bar up and are able to escape it.

271
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.330
Can they do that? If you can not control people, how can you control dinosaurs?

272
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.590
And it's a perfect illustration of that. Another thing I've got on here,

273
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.040
I don't love. And again, this is almost more of a Spielberg commentary.

274
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.810
I don't love the dinosaur sneeze.

275
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.740
I don't need the brackets are sneezing on legs. And I get that. It is for kids.

276
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:03.000
It's a lot like the scene in temple of doom when they're ha they first get to

277
00:14:03.001 --> 00:14:06.600
the palace and like, Oh, we're having a great feast for you tonight.

278
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.360
And it's just a quick gross at the moment,

279
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.820
knowing that a lot of your audience is seven years old,

280
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.800
but I personally think there are better ways to appeal to kids and just have a

281
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:23.100
dinosaur season, especially when it's the worst amatronic of the entire movie.

282
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.660
<v 0>And then if you hypothetically were to rewatch this movie during a global</v>

283
00:14:27.661 --> 00:14:30.930
pandemic, that involves the potential of coughing on people.

284
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.060
It added an extra layer. When I saw that,

285
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.300
cause I imagined an infected dinosaur coughing on me and she's covered with it

286
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:39.690
like slime. And then as a clean freak, I think there's no towels.

287
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.760
There's no like wet wipes. She's just out here.

288
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.650
<v 1>If she cleaned it off at all, it was back in that like runoff, sewer,</v>

289
00:14:46.651 --> 00:14:49.290
where she was hiding during the car sequins. And who's to say,

290
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:53.240
that's not filled with GRD from like, we don't have the answers to that,

291
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.420
but I'm glad we agreed on this. You know, we can shake on it. Nope, Nope.

292
00:14:56.421 --> 00:14:58.940
Not going to shake on it. Nope. I will probably cut that.

293
00:14:58.941 --> 00:14:59.900
I didn't like that bit around.

294
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.250
<v 0>Cut it. Cause you said we shouldn't and then it'll be a joke on your behalf.</v>

295
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.200
Anything else you think is bad about this movie?

296
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.250
<v 1>I think there are a couple moments, even though we have the Mr. DNA, uh,</v>

297
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.080
sequence, which is perfect exposition,

298
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.580
there are a couple moments of exposition that I don't love so much,

299
00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:19.690
which is T-Rex his vision is based on movement. You start saying that early on,

300
00:15:19.691 --> 00:15:24.130
we say it five different times. So I appreciate like the brute force of it,

301
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.830
but it's still something that's just like, okay,

302
00:15:26.831 --> 00:15:28.870
you clearly just need this for a plot element.

303
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.810
<v 0>Since learned is not true. Uh, yeah. That's uh,</v>

304
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.420
that's one of the dinosaur facts that isn't true. Uh,

305
00:15:34.421 --> 00:15:36.850
their eyes were actually more straight ahead than on the sides.

306
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:41.590
So there's no good evidence right now that that's how T-Rex I worked

307
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.070
well. They also had feathers, any last bad things that you can muster.

308
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:45.791
<v 1>Lastly.</v>

309
00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:50.470
And I'll point out is the I'm calling this financial continuity in that,

310
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.370
uh, scene that we get, which is like the long dark night of the soul,

311
00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:58.600
where you have Dern and Attenborough talking in the cafeteria,

312
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.240
they're eating melting ice cream because it would go to waste.

313
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:02.920
Otherwise that is like,

314
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.210
that's the ice cream that you go to Kroger and get it's a six gallon. Yeah.

315
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.320
It's like, and sure, it's delicious. I will eat that all day.

316
00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:13.630
But a guy is saying spared, no expense.

317
00:16:13.631 --> 00:16:17.290
As his catchphrase on this Island is spared expense on the ice cream.

318
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.820
<v 0>And Laura, Darren has a vine and she goes, no, it's not, no way, no way.</v>

319
00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:24.640
It's good at all. Plain vanilla. It's not even vanilla beam.

320
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.830
Like I can enjoy that,

321
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.120
but it's not good to compare that to the cake buffet that the children enjoy

322
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.320
later. There's like a French patisseries somewhere on this Island.

323
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.630
Why would you make all that? You know, that there's like six people here.

324
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.600
<v 1>That's where I do like the kid acting on the kid jokes,</v>

325
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.670
Timmy grabbing two serving spades and just be like almost ready to

326
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.080
sharpen them against each other.

327
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.540
<v 0>Before we get to the brilliant, let's have a little fun.</v>

328
00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:51.970
We're going to do the lightning round now where we can ask each other questions

329
00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:55.930
that are related or kind of related to the movie, we'll go back and forth,

330
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.880
but you can start first. So, uh, what's your first question.

331
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.360
<v 1>So we've already gone over lard Dern in this movie was a sexual awakening for</v>

332
00:17:01.361 --> 00:17:02.410
me. Uh,

333
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.480
what movie or TV character at some point served as a real

334
00:17:07.481 --> 00:17:09.580
bounce for your sexual understanding?

335
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.740
<v 0>Uh, Madonna. And I'm pretty sure it was the,</v>

336
00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:15.610
like a prayer video because one of the first dreams I ever had in life that was

337
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:18.880
at all sexual involve Madonna. And as a kid,

338
00:17:18.881 --> 00:17:20.320
I was just confused about what it meant,

339
00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:22.570
but I think that was the first time my unconscious was sexually active.

340
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.300
And it's beautiful. If you had to go on a deep jungle adventure,

341
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.130
which character do you take with you and why?

342
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.520
<v 1>I'm just going to go with Muldoon because this is a man who has a dark history</v>

343
00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:34.870
clearly. Yes. Uh, and he's also capable with a gun until he's not.

344
00:17:34.871 --> 00:17:35.740
So I'm taking them.

345
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.560
<v 0>We can say iconic lines from this guy,</v>

346
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.570
clever girl and shoot her very iconic.

347
00:17:43.571 --> 00:17:44.980
He did a lot with a little in this film.

348
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.740
<v 1>So Jurassic park had a ton of toys and merchandising so much that they even</v>

349
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:52.200
referenced it in the movie before the movie came out.

350
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:53.670
By seeing that star to the gift shop.

351
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.100
Is there a movie or other media property that you think should have had

352
00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:00.540
more toys associated with?

353
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:03.330
It there'll be a lot of fun for us to play with those kids or adults. Okay.

354
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.050
<v 0>Yeah. This one kind of toys, but maybe an overall aesthetic.</v>

355
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.130
I think the Royal Tenenbaums. So like you could have the outfits,

356
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.040
you could have like a children's book with paintings in that style.

357
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.740
You could even do like a kind of tweet,

358
00:18:14.741 --> 00:18:16.460
like a record player for someone's house.

359
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.290
I just think you could have got a lot of leverage out of that.

360
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.700
And I think that's evidenced by how many people still use that as inspiration

361
00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:24.080
for like Halloween costumes every year.

362
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.840
<v 1>So he could have really teamed up with urban Outfitters on that one.</v>

363
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.040
<v 0>Wes Anderson missed out on buckets of money with that idiot.</v>

364
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.930
What animal or creature in general would you bring back from extinction?

365
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:36.950
Can't be dinosaurs.

366
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.670
<v 1>The first thing that's coming to mind is a cave bear.</v>

367
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.570
I'm one of those big macro faunas from, you know,

368
00:18:44.571 --> 00:18:46.520
before from around the last ice age,

369
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.340
we know that Jurassic park doesn't turn out well,

370
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.230
but let's say this is happening in real life.

371
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.810
And you even know all these consequences. Do you still,

372
00:18:53.811 --> 00:18:56.810
as whether the president or chief investor say, let's try it.

373
00:18:56.811 --> 00:18:57.920
I think we can do it this time.

374
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.260
<v 0>I still think I would.</v>

375
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.250
There's something about dinosaurs and space travel or those two things that the

376
00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:06.830
kid brain and all of us can't say no to too exciting.

377
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.570
What do you think dinosaur meat tastes like?

378
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:13.370
<v 1>So it's reptile the easy comp there is alligator.</v>

379
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.680
If anyone has not had alligator,

380
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.970
it's the simple comp there is just chicken meats, fish. And I love frog.

381
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.370
I love alligator. And on the amphibian side, like frog legs.

382
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.750
And because these are mutated dinosaurs who are part frog, there we go.

383
00:19:26.751 --> 00:19:29.930
So it's a very white meat, almost translucent, probably.

384
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.600
Although you could get some red meat, like on a bigger carnivore. Yeah.

385
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.711
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

386
00:19:32.711 --> 00:19:35.540
So we want a Cajun chef on this because they would have the experience with

387
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:36.374
alligators and frogs.

388
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.110
<v 1>The easy answer is you get surf blackened.</v>

389
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.780
<v 0>Thank you for that. That was a very fun lightning round.</v>

390
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.850
And I appreciate all the prep that went into that on your end.

391
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.880
There's so much mutual respect here. A lot of respect. I feel it.

392
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.710
So now that we've done good,

393
00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:51.710
bad and lightening round it's time to get into the parts of the movie that make

394
00:19:51.711 --> 00:19:55.040
us think the real big questions for us. That's the brilliant section.

395
00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:59.240
So what is something from Jurassic park that you think deserves the title of

396
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.870
brilliant?

397
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.290
<v 1>Let's just start with the core of this movie thematically.</v>

398
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:08.210
The idea that the brute force of nature will always try humph

399
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.420
over intellect. And we're seeing that on every,

400
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.280
every time someone fails in this movie,

401
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:17.870
pretty much it's because they thought they could outsmart the just basic forces

402
00:20:17.871 --> 00:20:21.170
of nature, whether it's ham and thinking, I can control these bees,

403
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.630
whether it is Nedjeree thinking, Oh,

404
00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:26.900
I can create a computer virus and I can escape the Island, but no,

405
00:20:26.901 --> 00:20:28.850
the typhoon gets in his way. Uh,

406
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.370
and he was never even planning for that in the first place.

407
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:36.500
Even one of my favorite shots in this movie has always been when the Raptors are

408
00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:39.830
attacking the control room and you see from the, probably the Mr.

409
00:20:39.831 --> 00:20:42.950
DNA shows going up and you see the genetic code projected onto the raft.

410
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.570
And just like, I love that.

411
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.250
I don't know if I'm fully appreciate everything that's going there and I'm going

412
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:50.530
to take a stab at it after watching it last night,

413
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.450
the idea is the Raptor is so smart right now. And,

414
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:59.140
but even that brilliance is born of nature.

415
00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:02.560
So the reason you can never use brilliant out smart nature is because it's

416
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:05.110
coming back from that same source and it's going to bowl you over.

417
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.770
<v 0>Well. Yeah. And I think like that, so much of that is summed up in Malcolm's.</v>

418
00:21:07.771 --> 00:21:09.330
You know, life finds a way quote.

419
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:14.490
<v 4>Implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed.</v>

420
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.630
No, I'm simply saying that life finds a way.

421
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.700
<v 0>And I think that says a lot about how like organic matter and organic life is</v>

422
00:21:23.701 --> 00:21:27.000
something that in so much as humans have constantly tried to control it,

423
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.950
we just can't. Um,

424
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.810
every single time humans have the hubris to think that we can control where

425
00:21:33.811 --> 00:21:36.060
water is flowing or the temperature in a certain place,

426
00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:39.120
or what livestock grows here or there, things can take us out.

427
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.410
Even a small virus that we can't even see could potentially have a life altering

428
00:21:43.411 --> 00:21:46.050
effect on an entire planet. Hypothetic you're talking about,

429
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.930
I'm just spit balling. I saw a contagion recently. It seems like a fun,

430
00:21:48.931 --> 00:21:50.790
fictional idea. I think the movie,

431
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.970
a lot of the questions it brings up are just as relevant,

432
00:21:53.971 --> 00:21:56.310
if not more relevant now than they were then. So, you know,

433
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.310
I've written down whether it's genetic engineering, cloning and,

434
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.660
and the big idea of humans modifying nature, um,

435
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:08.100
and that weird kind of paradox of humans being natural entities,

436
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.690
which via our weird,

437
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.790
up reason are now trying to go backwards and change the same natural

438
00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:17.100
processes that led to us. It seems not good.

439
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.060
<v 1>It's an, obviously there, you're getting into the Lord Dern quote, the,</v>

440
00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:23.760
you know, God creates dinosaur has got a story's dinosaurs,

441
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.080
or I guess it starts with Sam Neill. That's okay. No,

442
00:22:27.081 --> 00:22:29.190
it starts with Ian Malcolm, who is Jeff Goldbloom.

443
00:22:29.191 --> 00:22:30.540
There are too many names in the world.

444
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.720
<v 4>Destroys dinosaur. God creates man,</v>

445
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.540
man destroys God man creates

446
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.970
eat. Man.

447
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.340
<v 1>This movie is constantly obsessed with the idea of what is</v>

448
00:22:50.341 --> 00:22:55.110
that force that is causing sort of regeneration and destruction and rebuilding.

449
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.750
And can you ever, you know, as I started saying earlier,

450
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.630
can you ever sort of come out on top of that? Can you beat it in the long run?

451
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.670
And the very clear answer seems to be no,

452
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.110
but what you can do with grant and the pelicans, he's looking at the end,

453
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.590
you can decide I'm going to kind of go with the flow here and see if I can ride

454
00:23:10.591 --> 00:23:11.424
that out too.

455
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.650
<v 0>Yeah. And I think that the quote you mentioned before, that's, uh, the,</v>

456
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.210
to partner with Malcolm and in the Lord during character, when it's sort of,

457
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:21.560
you know, uh, God grades, dinosaurs kills dinosaurs creates man, the,

458
00:23:21.561 --> 00:23:25.860
the important part views. And it says, man kills God. So I think without that,

459
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.000
the film wouldn't be as poignant,

460
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.230
but the idea that humans have killed off the idea of something that's more

461
00:23:31.231 --> 00:23:32.700
powerful than them outside of them.

462
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.020
And the killing of God gives them the ability to think that we are God and we

463
00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:40.740
can create things which makes me then think about the way in which human

464
00:23:40.741 --> 00:23:45.470
innovation can lead or sow the seeds at least to self extinction. Yeah.

465
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.100
And.

466
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.340
<v 1>You also have the quote. I love the scene so much.</v>

467
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:53.090
It's after the rafter feeding, they go into like, okay, let's eat our lunch now.

468
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.880
And they are in this board room,

469
00:23:55.881 --> 00:23:58.430
which is just dark and Scott projectors going around,

470
00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:02.420
like it's oddly reminiscent of like the Dr. Strange love more room almost.

471
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:03.171
And the idea is, okay,

472
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:06.320
we're now going to have a rational discussion about the entire problem of the

473
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:06.740
park.

474
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.890
And we're going to look at all entirely through financial terms with projections

475
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:13.910
of future revenue and stuff like that. Malcolm calls out to John Hammond.

476
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.800
He's like, you didn't actually do most of this work.

477
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.330
You stood on the shoulders of giants.

478
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.450
And there's a real big thing throughout this movie of one.

479
00:24:20.451 --> 00:24:22.100
When he shows up he's in pure white,

480
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:25.220
he's not dirty by the dig site or any other work he's ever done.

481
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.530
This is a movie that is entirely about digging.

482
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:29.750
You dig into the ground to find the rock.

483
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:32.990
You dig into the rock to find the mosquito into mosquito, to find the blood,

484
00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:36.110
to find the DNA, and then to blow that back up into a dinosaur.

485
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.150
And he is someone who is in even a neutral sense of term. He's a confidence,

486
00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:43.790
man. He's just the music man style salesman saying,

487
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.730
I can sell this to you and everyone get behind me.

488
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.180
And because he is not directly involved with any of the processes,

489
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:55.280
he never has an appreciation for what could go wrong and why that's

490
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:55.840
important.

491
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.160
<v 0>Well, exactly. I think there's a theme too,</v>

492
00:24:57.161 --> 00:25:01.930
of people that have the power to make modifications to nature or innovate new

493
00:25:01.931 --> 00:25:05.170
technologies are often the types of people that aren't physically doing those

494
00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:07.300
things and might not have to live with the consequences.

495
00:25:07.301 --> 00:25:10.480
So whether it's like an industrialization building these awesome factories and

496
00:25:10.481 --> 00:25:14.140
not realizing that the waste of those factories would poison drinking water for

497
00:25:14.141 --> 00:25:15.490
generations and kill off people,

498
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.880
whether it's the way in which we've used various sources of energy to now

499
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.940
drastically change the ecosystem of our actual planet.

500
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.880
Most of these things are done without thinking through the potential

501
00:25:24.881 --> 00:25:27.310
implications of them. And by the time we realize it it's too late.

502
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.030
<v 1>So we already talked a little bit about, um,</v>

503
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.860
Alan Grant's arc from, you know, essentially, uh,

504
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.320
put off bachelor to family, man.

505
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.020
We're also dealing with other family themes in there and I'm,

506
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.250
it's cool that it's able to tackle complex ideas in very small ways.

507
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.840
I really think that there's a big theme of PTSD going on in here with the kids,

508
00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:53.290
especially with Lex. I, my friends do not agree with this.

509
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.490
I'm going to still make the argument.

510
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.760
Now that I have a platform when Lex screams,

511
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.120
she's talking about Janeiro for Donald and after getting out of the car.

512
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.510
But whether she realized she's actually talking about her dad,

513
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:09.970
who we know is getting divorced divorce from her mom,

514
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.340
and she's just processing that in the moment.

515
00:26:12.341 --> 00:26:15.100
And now she's having this awful catharsis. I mean.

516
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.760
<v 0>Sigmund Freud would a hundred percent agree with you that that is what's</v>

517
00:26:18.761 --> 00:26:21.820
happening there. So I think that's a valid reading and I think any abilities,

518
00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:24.550
friends who make them feel that about that reading should read a book. No,

519
00:26:24.551 --> 00:26:25.630
I think that's a really cool reading.

520
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.180
And one of the only other things I'm thinking about for brilliant,

521
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.490
and I think Malcolm gives this speech at the end,

522
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.880
the could and should distinction, which touches on what we're already saying.

523
00:26:33.881 --> 00:26:36.550
But when he says to Hammond, you know, you only thought about,

524
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.890
could you do this? Not, should you do this?

525
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.230
<v 1>We're so preoccupied with whether or not they could.</v>

526
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.430
They just have to think if they should.

527
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.470
It becomes this sort of intellectualized game of just,

528
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.420
that is entirely about outcomes rather than the process and how that influences

529
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:52.830
and informs potential outcomes.

530
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.600
And I even love when Ian Malcolm is after he explains the basics of chaos to us

531
00:26:57.601 --> 00:26:59.910
and he references, you know, the, the butterfly theory.

532
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.900
<v 5>There's the butterfly effect, a butterfly flap,</v>

533
00:27:02.901 --> 00:27:06.320
its wings contain in central pocket that rain instead, essentially he.

534
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.161
<v 1>So immediately,</v>

535
00:27:07.161 --> 00:27:11.810
we're starting to see examples of how this is occurring in the

536
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.340
park five seconds after he says that we're trying to get our seatbelts on as the

537
00:27:16.341 --> 00:27:19.250
helicopter descends. And Oh, no, we both got the wrong ends.

538
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.980
That's just the result of chaotic inputs.

539
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.920
If they sit slightly different to the left or the right,

540
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.400
then we get the right seat belt. But because humans can't be controlled,

541
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.500
they're the variable that you insert into this.

542
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.630
And that's what makes the park so dangerous.

543
00:27:32.631 --> 00:27:36.470
It's our own actions that we presume are going to be safe and effective. I mean,

544
00:27:36.471 --> 00:27:39.590
honestly, it's the same thing that you get with something like a pandemic,

545
00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:41.990
you know, that we should shut down, you know,

546
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.530
public areas and everyone should wash their hands. But when you personally,

547
00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:49.220
you know, don't wash your hands for one second, that I'm probably okay,

548
00:27:49.221 --> 00:27:50.660
I'm not going to be the one who gets it.

549
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.150
And just when you look at that in aggregate, then you get portable.

550
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.320
So two things, if you need it. Oh my God, I'm so hungry. Yeah.

551
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.790
<v 0>I'm going to just do that as well. But along with that, I mean,</v>

552
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:06.110
I think another thing and they made this is getting meta with the film here is

553
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:10.040
that all of the things we're talking about are just as relevant and interesting.

554
00:28:10.041 --> 00:28:11.930
Now, 27 years later as they were,

555
00:28:11.931 --> 00:28:14.000
when the film came out and in watching the film,

556
00:28:14.001 --> 00:28:17.240
it's not like these ideas are antiquated or of another era.

557
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.980
And I think that speaks to another reason why this film overall is so good.

558
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.040
Um, I think we've gotten a lot of meat off that bone.

559
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:26.630
Any other brilliant things you wanna throw out before we wrap up?

560
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.880
<v 5>There are themes. I, I.</v>

561
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.780
<v 1>I'm not going to feel qualified to talk about right now,</v>

562
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:37.160
but I had never noticed them before that there's a real colonial streak here,

563
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:42.110
looking at Hammond and Muldoon, as you know, colonial enemies, you know,

564
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:45.440
there's explicit references to, we've done this type of work in Kenya before.

565
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.340
<v 5>Can spare no expense, make the one I've gotten down in Kenya,</v>

566
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.420
looked like a petting zoo.

567
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.900
<v 1>We have, uh, both of them in classic. You know,</v>

568
00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:56.720
all they're missing is the pith helmet, you know, for, you know,

569
00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:01.190
English colonial garb. But the idea of we're not just doing this as, you know,

570
00:29:01.191 --> 00:29:05.180
scientists bringing animals back to life. It's really,

571
00:29:05.181 --> 00:29:10.070
we are transporting ourselves to their world and then we are imposing new rules

572
00:29:10.071 --> 00:29:12.890
upon it. And you see this back in that boardroom scene,

573
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.800
Hammond keeps using the word discovery.

574
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.980
<v 5>We stand in the lines of discovery.</v>

575
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.440
<v 1>It's not just about, you know,</v>

576
00:29:21.441 --> 00:29:25.730
the work it is about actually transporting themselves and body and mind to a

577
00:29:25.731 --> 00:29:27.650
different place and making it their own.

578
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.520
And I w I want to know what the intention is there behind that and what it

579
00:29:31.521 --> 00:29:32.390
really, you know, has saved it.

580
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.480
Or if it's just sort of a passing nod to the hubris of colonialism.

581
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:36.140
<v 0>Once again,</v>

582
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.140
I love that about this movie that we can keep finding stuff like that.

583
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.340
And I think on rewatch is we'll continue to find stuff like that. I literally.

584
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.390
<v 1>Have every six months,</v>

585
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:46.480
a moment in the shower where Jurassic park comes to mind and I realized the

586
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:48.970
connection like truly, and then I just,

587
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.060
I will like slap the door in the shower and be like, Oh my God,

588
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.610
that was intentional. They meant to do that. That's amazing.

589
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.730
<v 0>Okay. Bailey, we've talked about what's good,</v>

590
00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.210
bad and brilliant about Jurassic park did a little lightning round.

591
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.410
Let's reduce all of that discussion. Now do a simple three part rating system.

592
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.860
Do you think Jurassic park is good, bad.

593
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.890
<v 1>Brilliant. I am going to sum it up as brilliant.</v>

594
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.390
I think the fact that it is able to take so many complicated and moving pieces.

595
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.760
Not only make them work as a whole,

596
00:30:17.761 --> 00:30:21.510
but do so with a whole that is so consumable.

597
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.700
Anyone can watch this movie and love it.

598
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.470
Whether it's purely as a dinosaur movie,

599
00:30:25.471 --> 00:30:27.360
whether you like all the subplots in it,

600
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:31.350
everyone wants to see this movie and everyone will enjoy it and then can get all

601
00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:32.850
the extra stuff as they go through it. Yeah.

602
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.440
<v 0>Yeah. Because of everything you just said,</v>

603
00:30:34.441 --> 00:30:36.360
I also think Jurassic park is brilliant.

604
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.740
And I think another piece of evidence to that is I saw this movie when my age

605
00:30:40.741 --> 00:30:43.860
was in the single digits. I don't know how many times I've seen it in my life,

606
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.710
but rewatching it now, 27 years later, it's still great.

607
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.500
I still enjoy it as is evidenced by this conversation.

608
00:30:49.501 --> 00:30:52.080
There's still new stuff to think about. So like, it's a brilliant movie,

609
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.080
so we've done it all. We've talked about the movie we've rated the movie.

610
00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.300
It's time to wrap things up. Um,

611
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.020
and so normally we do a little recommended reading viewing section here.

612
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.250
I'm pretty sure neither of us are well-read and paleontology or

613
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.810
dinosaur biology.

614
00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.930
<v 1>Poorly read across the spectrum. I.</v>

615
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.320
<v 0>Assumed if it didn't want to say anything.</v>

616
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.240
So how about we just say another movie that we think has that

617
00:31:15.241 --> 00:31:18.570
same Jurassic park vibe, something from the eighties or nineties,

618
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.750
really tight script, something you could watch over and over again.

619
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.980
I'll let you go first.

620
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.370
What's another movie that exists in this universe that people should watch.

621
00:31:26.371 --> 00:31:26.910
If they haven't.

622
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.760
<v 1>If somehow they haven't seen it, they should watch Indiana Jones.</v>

623
00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:31.710
And the last crusade, also a Spielberg,

624
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.220
because everything that I love about Jurassic park,

625
00:31:35.221 --> 00:31:38.700
in terms of all the payoffs you get with Grant's journey, with a scene,

626
00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:41.430
chaos theory, take hold of the, of Jurassic park.

627
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.220
You get that instead of having a bunch of storylines,

628
00:31:44.221 --> 00:31:48.540
you get that in one emotional line that pays off in the biggest way of any movie

629
00:31:48.541 --> 00:31:53.100
I've ever seen in the most elegant sentence or two possible all movie long

630
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.730
Indiana Jones is trying to win the approval of his father,

631
00:31:56.731 --> 00:31:58.200
whether he recognizes it or not.

632
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:02.910
And we always know that his father does not see Indiana on Indiana's terms

633
00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:05.370
because he doesn't call him Indiana, his nickname. He calls him.

634
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.730
And at the very end in the, as a template collapsing,

635
00:32:08.731 --> 00:32:11.880
Indiana Jones is reaching for the Holy grail because it represents the

636
00:32:11.881 --> 00:32:14.910
relationship with his father. And if I can get that, I can make you love me.

637
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:19.740
And Sean Connery says all your hatred of yourself, all your hatred of may,

638
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:24.180
all the anger, all the need to win my approval, let it go, let it go.

639
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.900
They get out of there. They win and everyone's heart is healed.

640
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.110
<v 0>That's so good.</v>

641
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.560
I'm going to be so much less articulate and interesting with mine,

642
00:32:31.561 --> 00:32:35.040
but I will say if you either haven't seen it or haven't seen it in awhile, uh,

643
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.290
check out the original back to the future movie.

644
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.690
I think that it something interesting in that it's a movie about time travel.

645
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:45.020
That's not really about time travel. They don't get too hung up on all that.

646
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.590
It's really about like a teen finding himself, figuring out who he is,

647
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.260
navigating some issues with his relationship to his family.

648
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.540
<v 1>Having fun with an edible complex, having fun.</v>

649
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.170
<v 0>Of that edible complex, almost making out this mom just great stuff. Um,</v>

650
00:32:57.171 --> 00:32:59.450
but I think it really does hold up.

651
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:04.250
And the movie avoids getting too caught up in the science-y parts of it.

652
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.610
It's also funny and I enjoy a movie that's, that's funny. Sometimes.

653
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.230
<v 1>The speakers are loud and they're so loud that they lift them off the ground.</v>

654
00:33:11.231 --> 00:33:12.670
And that happens to me.

655
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.330
<v 0>No, that's the thing that happens all the time. Um, well, this is great. Uh,</v>

656
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.060
thank you so much for being here. Really appreciate it, Billy.

657
00:33:19.061 --> 00:33:22.330
If people want more of you in their lives after seeing this,

658
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.463
where can they find.

659
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.190
<v 1>They can find me on Twitter at Billy domino and you can see the scripts that I</v>

660
00:33:27.191 --> 00:33:30.250
write. I put them out there because I'm desperate for your approval.

661
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.530
Much like Indiana Jones. So, uh,

662
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.820
B my dad call me at Billy domino on Twitter and, uh, read some scripts.

663
00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:37.683
There'll be fun.

664
00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.330
