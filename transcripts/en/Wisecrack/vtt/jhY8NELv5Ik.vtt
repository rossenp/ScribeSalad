00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 1>What's up guys, Jared,</v>

2
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.380
here to talk about the most buzzworthy cinematic contribution of 29.

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.560
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.270
<v 1>I obviously mean joker.</v>

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.050
Now we expected that a film spotlight in comic book Laura's most iconic

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.330
super-villain would crush at the box office.

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.720
But what we didn't expect was that the director of the hangover part who would

8
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:29.000
be so central to the politicals EIT Geist,

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.990
but one of the most interesting things about joker is that while it clearly

10
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.360
resonated strongly in 2019,

11
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.720
so much of the film borrows from past cinematic traditions.

12
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.840
And when you parse through the copious references from film history,

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.320
you'll find that they're all drawing from approximately the same time period.

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.030
That is the mid 1970s to early eighties. That's not us being evil geniuses.

15
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.170
Todd Phillips has said.

16
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.300
<v 2>Watch, but it was really a group of movies and, um, a time of movies. So,</v>

17
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.400
so I would almost argue that it's, it was movies from 1973 to 1981.

18
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.730
There's a ton of movies that influenced this film.

19
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.350
<v 1>Quick caveat because saying the phrase movies made between 1973 to 1981,</v>

20
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.630
a takes forever, and B is boring.

21
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.350
We're just going to broadly refer to this time period as seventies cinema.

22
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.240
So forgive us for the slight fudging.

23
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.900
Now the seventies were an objectively cool and complex time for movies,

24
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.990
and we're constantly repping the era in our videos. Still.

25
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:28.940
We've been wondering why is jokers so preoccupied with this era of filmmaking?

26
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.500
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on references in joker and major

27
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.410
spoilers ahead for a film that you and a hundred million other people have

28
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.280
already seen. Also older movies like taxi driver and the King of comedy.

29
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.500
So let's dive in Phillips.

30
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.340
His seventies vibe is evident in every frame of the film from the gritty

31
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:50.030
establishing shots of Gotham to the impressionistic angles of Joaquin's

32
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:51.110
interpretive dancing.

33
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.770
But that inspiration also manifests pretty heavily in the movies themes,

34
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.780
which is what we're going to be focusing on today.

35
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.160
Now Phillip's vision board is so crowded with themes from this era ranging from

36
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:05.360
class conflict to the cult of celebrity that we could be chatting until the

37
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:07.670
inevitable joker sequel arrives in theaters.

38
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.640
So in the interest of not missing happy hour, we pick the three,

39
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:15.440
we find most interesting part one bad guys in the 1970s,

40
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.270
the antihero reign Supreme and antihero is basically a morally ambiguous

41
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.870
protagonist who would probably sell out their own mother for a decent old

42
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.650
fashioned. Now the seventies were deep in the era of new Hollywood,

43
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.270
a period that began in the mid 1960s and was defined by bulldog tour directors

44
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.390
like Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola and Stanley Cooper.

45
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.890
These guys in their cohorts may daring films like medium cool dog day

46
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:43.730
afternoon, taxi driver, five easy pieces, Harold and Maude,

47
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.140
any hall American graffiti and so on. According to scholar David Thompson,

48
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.370
while films of the previous decade featured naive and liberal revolutionary

49
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:56.630
notions and harness the era's optimistic energy films of the early seventies

50
00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:01.360
became confounded by actual experiences showed the moral bankruptcy of the

51
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.740
established order. Yes,

52
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.610
you don't have to be a film scholar to see why movies turned grimly cynical.

53
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.810
This time period was basically defined by post Vietnam war despair and anger at

54
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.730
the establishment. In 1972,

55
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.750
that cocktail of misery was coupled with outrage over Watergate and ensuing

56
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.560
disillusionment with the government by night, 10 74,

57
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.620
just 36% of Americans trusted the government.

58
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.270
That meant movies about flawed bro worlds and deeply cynical characters.

59
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.950
Fittingly. That also meant the rise of the anti-hero or that almost always male

60
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.830
protagonists, who is complex and deeply flawed.

61
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.910
Sometimes beyond the point of redemption. These characters make shocking,

62
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.420
morally ambiguous choices from taxi drivers, Travis pickle,

63
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:46.830
who commits a heinously violent act to save a child victim of sex trafficking to

64
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:50.670
the King of comedies Rupert Pupkin who takes a famous comedian hostage in order

65
00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:54.600
to score some decent airtime for his own stand-up act to dog day afternoon,

66
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.590
sunny ward sick,

67
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.310
who tries to Rob a bank in order to acquire money for his partner sex change.

68
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.730
While none of these acts jive with our general collective morality,

69
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:06.480
we're still able to empathize with and understand the reasons behind each

70
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.710
character's actions,

71
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.430
but from the mid seventies and on largely due to one mechanical shark and a

72
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:13.200
certain galaxy far, far away,

73
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.040
Hollywood became increasingly reliant on unsure fire blockbusters.

74
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.840
And with some exceptions has remained that way pretty much ever since in recent

75
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:25.380
years, that's meant an increasing supply of IP driven content.

76
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.710
Specifically those reliably successful comic book movies.

77
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.460
Most of those are inspired by superheroes from the golden era of comic books who

78
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:35.460
typically represent moral rectitude. As a result,

79
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:38.640
these stories are typically pretty black and white about morality.

80
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.170
You have a hero and you have a villain, they Duke it out. The hero wins, hooray.

81
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.130
Sure your Spider-Man or Ironman might make a mistake or learn a lesson or

82
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.690
overcome an unfortunate flaw.

83
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.440
And no one's trilogy certainly shows its protagonist grappling with some moral

84
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:54.210
issues. Still. For the most part,

85
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.990
they're unlikely to make an Uber morally questionable choice like Travis,

86
00:04:57.991 --> 00:04:59.100
Rupert, or sunny.

87
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.270
This brings us to joker the first Hollywood film to laser focus on the

88
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.200
super-villain Phillips takes this big budget opportunity and uses it as a

89
00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:08.850
vehicle to revive the seventies,

90
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.030
ethos of a complex character in a doomed society,

91
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.900
turning Arthur Fleck into a character that obliterates are easy distinctions

92
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:16.980
between good and evil.

93
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.050
Like many of these seventies heroes Arthur is flawed complex and to varying

94
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:24.390
degrees sympathetic. But by subbing,

95
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.750
this seventies archetype into the context of a comic book, film,

96
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.900
Phillips subverts, the superhero genre and challenges,

97
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:33.180
the typical simplicity of its morality.

98
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.010
There's also another level of subversion to Phillips is also using a mainstream

99
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:41.700
Hollywood film as a sneaky vehicle for reviving the seventies.

100
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.450
That is the last real golden era of independent filmmaking before Hollywood

101
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:49.860
became a pipeline for big budget action films and hangover sequels he's dropping

102
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:53.970
mainstream studio dollar bills to depict the challenging morality of these

103
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:58.940
gritty independent films and to reflectively comment on and complicate the comic

104
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:03.470
book, film genre, pretty cool part too fantasy versus reality.

105
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.790
One of Joker's defining features is how it bends the distinction between fantasy

106
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:08.624
and reality.

107
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.140
This dramatic tension also appears in some of our favorite seventies films.

108
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.280
Most notably the film's biggest inspirations Martin score says these films,

109
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:19.790
taxi driver and the King of comedy. Many people have pointed this out,

110
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:23.150
but joker borrows copiously from both films, for example,

111
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:25.490
in Joker's best homage to the King of comedy,

112
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:27.950
it casts Robert de Niro as a famous comedian.

113
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.580
Exactly like the one played by Jerry Lewis opposite a young DeNiro.

114
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.370
<v 3>How do you, how do you do it? I think it's that I look at my whole life and I,</v>

115
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.510
I see the awful,

116
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.500
terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.

117
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.780
I just happens. But what about the first few one-liners?

118
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.930
Were they strong enough? I wasn't strong enough. No, they run as strong.

119
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.140
You had hurt yourself. That model is your Debbie bastard like.

120
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.490
<v 1>Comedy's Rupert.</v>

121
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.170
Arthur also has delusions of finding a father figure in said famous comedian and

122
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.850
when rejected lashes out violently and in Joker's Besto Mazda taxi driver,

123
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.600
it depicts Arthur as sharing Travis's inordinate fascination with guns.

124
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.440
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

125
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.030
<v 1>In a delightfully dark touch,</v>

126
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.050
Arthur and his neighbor even mimic Travis's iconic finger gun to the head,

127
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.940
possibly as if to indicate that like him,

128
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.500
neither of them have anything to lose both taxi driver and the King of comedy

129
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:30.670
feature outcast characters with pretty bleak lives going through tough times

130
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.060
only to conclude with their greatest wildest dreams.

131
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.410
Realize Travis becomes a celebrated hero precisely because of his violent

132
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.310
vigilantism.

133
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.960
And he gets hit on by his dream girl to boot while Rupert becomes a world famous

134
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:47.290
comedian, precisely because he took another comedian hostage.

135
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.120
These two outcomes are improbable at best and completely delusional at worst.

136
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.130
That's why both are also frequently interpreted as being pure fantasy in taxi

137
00:07:57.131 --> 00:07:57.964
driver.

138
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.600
Travis kills multiple people with an illegally purchased firearm and doesn't go

139
00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:02.320
to jail,

140
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.910
but rather is valorized the King of comedy frequently transitions into fantasy

141
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:10.870
sequences and the improbable ending could read like one of those.

142
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.330
So despite score says, he's occasional protest.

143
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.920
We to read each film's conclusion as the desperate imaginings of a troubled

144
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:21.250
character with only the most tenuous grasp on reality,

145
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.180
but beyond the superficial plot or character references, Travis and Rupert,

146
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.380
each emerge as a remarkably appropriate blueprint for a character like the joker

147
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.700
who is notorious for lacking any semblance of a stable, reliable pass.

148
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.540
We talk about the Joker's ever-shifting origin story extensively in another wise

149
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.141
crack addition,

150
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:42.490
but here's the too long didn't watch of jokers and scrutable past and Alan

151
00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:43.510
Moore's the killing joke.

152
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.980
Jokers portrayed as a failed comedian who had one bad day that turned him very

153
00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:52.060
bad later. We learned that joker. Isn't even sure if that backstory is true,

154
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.700
which would make crafting his LinkedIn profile, particularly in contrast,

155
00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:00.810
Christopher Nolan's joker is a pathological liar who seems to ad lib the truth

156
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.830
for his own amusement.

157
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.070
<v 4>You want to know what got these scars?</v>

158
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.000
My father was a drinker.

159
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.320
So I had a wife like you.

160
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.360
<v 1>Most intriguing comic writer.</v>

161
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.860
Scott Snyder gave us a joker who uses his mysterious origins to manipulate those

162
00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.060
around him. Fittingly.

163
00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:27.170
This includes posing as a psychiatric researcher working on his own report,

164
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.260
which he fills with tragic tales of childhood abuse.

165
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.640
I did my best to help come up with the story you wanted, the one you needed,

166
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.830
the grim and grimy tale of woe.

167
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.580
The one a publisher would lay down six figures for viewed in this light,

168
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.840
aligning joker with the also unreliable perspectives of a Travis pickle or

169
00:09:44.841 --> 00:09:46.970
Rupert Pupkin makes a lot of sense.

170
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.050
It actually underscores the fact that we could take the entire movie with a

171
00:09:51.051 --> 00:09:54.890
grain of salt. In fact, joker could almost be read as either a,

172
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.090
an imaginary Snyder style sob story cooked up by the joker himself,

173
00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:00.290
fallen Arkham asylum,

174
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.180
or B an imaginary delusional tale of the Joker's rise to folk hero,

175
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.740
much as Travis's newspaper clippings or Rupert's memoir were for them either

176
00:10:09.741 --> 00:10:13.040
way. It gives this lasagna of a film, a whole extra layer,

177
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.030
but there's another interesting aspect of the fantasy reality dichotomy in all

178
00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:18.110
three of these films,

179
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:21.770
the deep isolation of the central character leads them to fervently pursue the

180
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:25.730
affection of a beautiful inaccessible woman. In the two score says he films,

181
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.200
the men's ensuing short-lived court ships are painted as real and painfully

182
00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:34.390
awkward in joker. Arthur also harbors an unrequited love for his neighbors,

183
00:10:34.391 --> 00:10:35.000
Sophie.

184
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.660
He takes her out on a fun date and even get some after committing his first

185
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:42.050
murder psych due to imagine the whole thing. In fact,

186
00:10:42.051 --> 00:10:45.650
he doesn't realize until he shows up uninvited at an unsuspecting Sophie's

187
00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:46.400
apartment,

188
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.300
a clarifying montage shows us that unlike Travis or Rupert's fledgling

189
00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:51.134
relationships,

190
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.160
Arthur's budding romance existed only in his deeply troubled mind.

191
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.730
The thing about all three of these women is that they are the unlucky objects of

192
00:10:58.731 --> 00:11:00.320
these three men's fantasies,

193
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.820
projections of their desires to find love beauty and a merciful end to their

194
00:11:04.821 --> 00:11:07.250
tragic isolation, except in joker.

195
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.580
This romance is literally imaginary as if, well,

196
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.930
literally the extent of these three men's delusional projections in this way,

197
00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:19.460
the film seems to argue that no idealized love story could save Arthur or Travis

198
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.470
or Rupert from their own rage,

199
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.010
pathology and above all intolerable loneliness.

200
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.290
Part three media sensationalism.

201
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.830
This brings us to another important theme that joker shares with many seventies

202
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:35.330
films, that of media sensationalism. Now we delve deeply into the influence.

203
00:11:35.331 --> 00:11:39.890
The 1976 film network had on joker in our quick take joker and the politics of

204
00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:40.670
recognition,

205
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.140
but network also reflects rather presciently on the way sensationalized media

206
00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:49.070
can completely transform public perception in network news,

207
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:53.890
anchor Howard Beale goes off the rails and decries what he sees as a deeply and

208
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:55.000
broken society.

209
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 5>We know things are bad, worse than bad. They're crazy.</v>

210
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.870
It's like everything everywhere. He's going crazy. So we don't go out anymore.

211
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.980
<v 1>And he threatens to commit suicide on the air.</v>

212
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.370
His crazed rants resonate deeply all across America.

213
00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:11.000
As people take to their windows to scream at nobody.

214
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.563
<v 5>Particular.</v>

215
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.820
<v 1>News executives, seeing the power of Beall's anger,</v>

216
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.720
continue to spotlight him and plan even more sensational media.

217
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.470
The film argues that people who are emotionally and spiritually disillusioned

218
00:12:25.471 --> 00:12:29.640
with a broken system can be very easily swayed by the forces of mass media,

219
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.260
which direct our attention to whatever story is currently sexiest or in our day.

220
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.580
Cliquiest the ease with which Howard attracts a fervent following suggests that

221
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:42.750
our desperation to find truth and meaning can lead us dangerously astray.

222
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.410
Particularly when it's in the monetary interest of TV executives,

223
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.930
what's more network shows the shrewd way.

224
00:12:48.931 --> 00:12:53.160
The simple act of widespread media coverage effectively turns a very unstable

225
00:12:53.161 --> 00:12:58.050
Howard into a martyr reframing his objectively concerning suicide oath.

226
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.360
As a positive act of courage.

227
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.140
We see the same effect at the ending of both taxi driver and the King of comedy.

228
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.420
Whether you read them as imaginary or real,

229
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.610
Travis is celebrated status as a hero,

230
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.510
suggest the power of the media to reframe a society's moral outlook while

231
00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:16.740
Rupert's post crime rise to celebrities suggest that a media spectacle can as

232
00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:20.760
with Howard turn any audacious act and do something worth celebrating.

233
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.170
Similarly dog day afternoon shows the way an opportunistic media will gladly

234
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:29.730
transform someone like sunny and adult bankrobber into a folk hero for a

235
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:31.290
compliant thrill seeking.

236
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.213
<v 5>Public.</v>

237
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.450
<v 1>Joker. Similarly features no shortage of commentary on media sensationalism.</v>

238
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.300
After Arthur kills three wealthy Wayne employees,

239
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.140
the media transforms the anonymous clown into a figurehead for Goffman's

240
00:13:46.141 --> 00:13:47.370
impoverished masses,

241
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.960
a natural opponent of the revered Thomas Wayne excessive and sensational media

242
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:52.890
attention bloats.

243
00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:57.450
The importance of Arthur's act turning him like Sonny and Travis and Rupert and

244
00:13:57.451 --> 00:14:01.650
Howard from mere criminal or madman into a full hero.

245
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.910
As in the other films,

246
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.930
the masses comply and Arthur becomes the unwitting leader of a political

247
00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:07.351
movement.

248
00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:12.030
He doesn't care about Arthur's political apathy underscores the arbitrary nature

249
00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:16.260
of mob mentality and just how beholden we are to the choices the media makes

250
00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:17.670
about its coverage. Though,

251
00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:22.050
the film is set in a Gotham akin to an early eighties, New York city jokers.

252
00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:26.220
Shrewdly adapts the themes of these films for the intensified media climate of

253
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:31.140
our day today's internet hive mind can conjure literal mobs to storm top secret

254
00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:33.390
government facilities or Duncan children,

255
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.050
or more in the passing of the world's most dignified gorilla. Similarly,

256
00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:40.620
the fervor for which Arthur's actions are covered by the media effectively makes

257
00:14:40.621 --> 00:14:43.320
him like Heran Bay, a folk hero,

258
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:47.340
the violent mob that coalesces around him projects their own rage onto his

259
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:52.100
violent act and view it as a call to arms media spectacle film tells us

260
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.220
distorts the truth and misdirects our emotions.

261
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.220
There are those who would argue that just as media attention,

262
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.340
valorizes Arthur flecks actions for the people of Gotham,

263
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.490
it does the very same thing for real-world audiences,

264
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.320
uniting them behind a violent,

265
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:09.200
dangerous symbol of the mocked and disenfranchised.

266
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.980
That's why no discussion of joker is complete without mentioning the requisite

267
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:16.940
media controversy that surrounded his release accusations that the film would

268
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:21.290
encourage violence or validate dark audience impulses were widespread,

269
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.340
perhaps fittingly,

270
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:27.170
both of its two main inspirations taxi driver and the King of comedy also

271
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:29.840
experienced their own varying degrees of backlash.

272
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.920
Taxi driver had to make some edits to its climactic scene in order to skate by

273
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:37.940
with an R rating and was partially blamed for motivating an assassination

274
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:39.290
attempt on president Reagan.

275
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.310
The King of comedy also had its share of naysayers with comedian, Johnny Carson,

276
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.400
turning down the role of Jerry Langford out of fear of life,

277
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:50.630
imitating art and a healthy supply of negative reviews reiterated his point.

278
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.710
This isn't surprising films that basically forced us to empathize with

279
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:59.000
characters like Travis Bickle or Rupert Pupkin or Arthur Fleck characters who

280
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.460
make us grapple with morality reality.

281
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:05.300
And probably some other allergies that we don't have time to get into are always

282
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:07.340
going to be a lightning rod for controversy.

283
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.030
Ultimately though we think the way that joker thematically incorporated its own

284
00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:15.170
controversial cinematic forefathers is worth mentioning and pretty cool.

285
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.100
But what do you guys think is joker and effective callback to seventies

286
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:22.190
greatness or a blatant rip off wearing a clown mask?

287
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.420
