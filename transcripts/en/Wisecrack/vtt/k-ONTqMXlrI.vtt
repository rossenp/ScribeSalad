<v 0>This video is brought to you by surf shark, VPN</v>

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.060
what's up guys, Michael and his exceedingly fancy library here,

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.780
regardless of how you've been feeling about the state of life under quarantine

4
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:18.670
or semi quarantine, chances are, we've all had one shared fear,

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.330
confusion, but among that confusion, there is one consistent refrain.

6
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.330
We just got to figure something out until there's a vaccine.

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.770
Once we get that sweet,

8
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:31.490
sweet attenuated inactivity or modified virus in our bodies,

9
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.310
nothing will stop me from tiny Nana at the olive garden.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.420
But as much as I can't wait to carbo load unlimited lukewarm breadsticks with my

11
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:39.980
fellow pasta as family,

12
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.790
there is one thing this whole COVID crisis has revealed about how we think about

13
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.690
it. How we as a society, love to worship medicine.

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.130
Don't worry.

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.640
I'm not here to hate on all the medical advancements that saved millions lives,

16
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.270
but there is one thing that gets lost in the mix public health.

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.430
And while this term is come a cool new thing,

18
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.190
everyone gets to learn about during our playground and apocalypse.

19
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.580
I think there's a general sentiment that it's just the thing you do until

20
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:07.970
medicine catches up and to figure out why in general,

21
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.680
that's an awful perspective.

22
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.130
I want to talk about one of humanity's most little diseases to Burke.

23
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.240
Your losis welcome to the wisecrack edition on how to stop a plague.

24
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.770
But before we get into it,

25
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:21.680
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor surf shark VPN.

26
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.860
If you're anything like me, you online shop more often than you go to a store.

27
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.950
I mean, I can't remember the last time I went to a mall.

28
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.340
That means I usually am using my bank info on various sites.

29
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
It's just one reason why I find a VPN to be invaluable.

30
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.300
A VPN is a virtual private network, which means that once it's turned on,

31
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:40.070
it sends your data through an encrypted tunnel,

32
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:42.050
which protects you against malicious cyber attacks.

33
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.960
By shielding your information with surf short VPN,

34
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:49.430
you can feel safe using your computer phone game console or any other device to

35

make a purchase.

36
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.230

44
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.480
Now for tuberculosis is one nasty disease.

45
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.200
Fettuccine Alfredo left out in the sun for 48 hours nasty.

46
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.700
It is thought to have leapt from Bovis cattle or bison approximately

47
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:33.290
17,000 years ago.

48
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.150
And it's time TB has killed as many as 2 billion people throughout history,

49
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.800
making it as evil as like 2.2 million jonestowns it's

50
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:46.820
airborne and can cause symptoms and its host anywhere from weeks to decades

51
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.590
after exposure. That's right,

52
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.180
this dip disease can hide in your body longer than the Simpsons has been on TV,

53
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:55.340
which is to say way too long,

54
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.490
late COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to Holy I'm dead

55
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.870
in serious cases.

56
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:06.280
The TB bacteria replicates within the lungs causing the Monia coughs night

57
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:08.170
sweats, chest pain and exhaustion.

58
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.010
It can also catalyze such a drastic loss of weight and strength that it appears

59
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:13.960
to consume the afflicted patient,

60
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.620
which is why it was eventually dubbed consumption after striking the world with

61
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.480
renewed fervor in the 18th century,

62
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.950
TB surged in Europe and America at the onset of the industrial revolution as a

63
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:27.730
story and Frank Snowden explains in his book, epidemics and society at the time,

64
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.410
it was known as the white plague because of the way it drained all the human

65
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.520
colors from your face.

66
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.030
The medical establishment understood basically nothing about the disease,

67
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.990
presuming it to be hereditary and because many famous artists contracted the

68
00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:44.040
disease often writing or painting or composing great works while seriously ill

69
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.971
TB became.

70
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:49.350
And I'm not joking kind of cool disease itself was at degenerate

71
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:51.960
intoxicating effects and drove creativity.

72
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.910
Although as scholar Matthew Gandy notes,

73
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.290
widespread opiate addiction probably better explains this mental effervescence

74
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.250
for women.

75
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.910
The disease became associated with physical beauty and the amazing gated body

76
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:07.110
pale face flushed cheek look caused by TB became the height of fashion.

77
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:10.350
In some places, women would basically stop eating your exercise,

78
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.980
need to wear white face powder and blush to cosplay as consumptive that said

79
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:16.890
most victims of tuberculosis, weren't wealthy poets.

80
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.890
They were members of the urban poor, but we'll get to that.

81
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.370
But as germ theory spread throughout the scientific community in the late 18

82
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:23.880
hundreds,

83
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.240
tuberculosis stopped being a cool rich person disease and started being

84
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:29.670
something society wanted to declare war on.

85
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.090
It became viewed as a disease that punish the poor for their wretchedness.

86
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.800
Not only were people in overcrowded, slums, tenements, prisons, and alms houses,

87
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:41.610
more likely to become infected malnourishment and pre-existing diseases,

88
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.270
put them at a much higher risk for developing new life-threatening variety of

89
00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:46.590
TB. In some countries,

90
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.790
a concurrent imperialistic urge to maintain a strong military made tuberculosis,

91
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.460
especially in crowded barracks and on the front lines,

92
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.320
a real existential danger.

93
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.910
This chain mindset helped give rise to what Snowden calls the war on

94
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:03.390
tuberculosis from approximately 1880 to 19,

95
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.830
which relied primarily on various public health interventions to present the

96
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:09.120
further spread of the disease.

97
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.120
Here's where it's helpful for us to quickly distinguish between medical

98
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:13.560
intervention and public health.

99
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.280
A medical intervention is basically everything you associate with going to the

100
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:21.000
doctor, getting a procedure done, being prescribed a medication, et cetera,

101
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.390
public health is everything outside of that interaction.

102
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.790
If getting a vaccine is a medical intervention,

103
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.490
public health is determining what vaccines people need,

104
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.390
attribute them to what new vaccines to research and educating people on the

105
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:36.360
benefits of immunization. And interestingly enough,

106
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.130
long before TV treatment actually worked TB rates plummeted starting in the mid

107
00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:45.510
19th century in Europe and America because of a combination of intentional and

108
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.130
accidental public health measures.

109
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.910
One such strategy was the rise of the international sanitorium movement,

110
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.230
which advocated for isolating tuberculosis at what we're essentially fascist

111
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:58.100
club meds. They were first conceived by a German physician,

112
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.850
Herman Bremmer who experienced tuberculosis and healed in the Himalayas.

113
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.090
He credited his recovery to fresh air climate and rest.

114
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.060
And so started a sanatorium to standardize such treatment.

115
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.870
But the trend didn't really catch on until the 1880s with the establishment of

116
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.550
the first American sanatorium,

117
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.670
a little red near Saranac Lake in upstate New York,

118
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.820
where patients were required to spend eight to 10 hours a day outside,

119
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.140
soaking up the fresh air.

120
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.070
They also had to abstain almost entirely from exercise and eat a target of core

121
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.060
thousand calories a day to combat the consumptive effects of the disease.

122
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.600
Believing that negative emotions like shock or English stoked.

123
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:36.290
The illness nurses centered patients mailed to protect them from bad news.

124
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.080
These sorts of rules varied from institution to institution,

125
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.190
but across the board they made for a highly restricted life at the same time.

126
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.980
It also effectively quarantined those who were contagious,

127
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:48.290
which helped make a dent in the spread of the disease.

128
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.400
Getting into little red was a highly competitive process and many folks who are

129
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:54.500
rejected move to Lake Saranac anyway.

130
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.460
So the town became a sort of epicenter for TB treatment like Disney world for

131
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:02.120
the very ill while the medical intervention here is questionable.

132
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.100
This strategy had the inadvertent public health benefit of slowing further of TB

133
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.090
civically.

134
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.330
After spending time healing at the sanitorium patients would then return to

135
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.980
their urban homes. From there.

136
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:16.400
They would rely on dispensary's or medical centers that provided both medical

137
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:19.790
care and public health strategies like offering monetary loans or helping

138
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:21.620
patients find work. Importantly,

139
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:26.360
these dispensary's along with a slew of NGOs also offered community hygiene

140
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:30.200
education warning against the dangers of sneezing without covering your nose and

141
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:34.070
obsessing a little bit over the comparatively less risky act of spitting

142
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.130
concurrently starting around 1840 mid a little ethically questionable

143
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.030
was the segregation of the poor suffering from TB into work houses.

144
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.840
And it's widespread movements like this that really helped contain the disease

145
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:51.400
from further spread as scholar Matthew Gandy notes before the infectivity of the

146
00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:54.460
disease was understood. British workhouses admitted,

147
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.680
ever greater numbers of consumptive patients.

148
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.850
Continuing the issue then is not the effectiveness of treatment,

149
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.970
but the impact of containment on rates of infection.

150
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.140
Another social campaign about the spread of cow TB led to the screening of herds

151
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:12.550
for the disease and the now ubiquitous practice of pasteurizing milk at the same

152
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:16.120
time, these public health efforts, intensified improvements in nutrition,

153
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.020
urban housing,

154
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.740
and the proliferation of more hospitals were concurrently fighting TB while

155
00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:25.150
public health was kicking TVs. What new treatments were doctors concoct,

156
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.080
just a little thing called artificial neumothorax,

157
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.590
which basically collapsed and paralyzed the patient's lungs,

158
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.580
which they thought would allow them to heal like a broken bone in a cast.

159
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.880
Needless to say, this did not work.

160
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.280
A vaccine was debuted in 1921,

161
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:46.330
but it was mired in controversy because it a was not totally effective.

162
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.540
And B doesn't protect against all forms of TB.

163
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.300
By the time antibiotics for TB came around,

164
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.430
reported cases of TB had already plummeted Europe. Of course,

165
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.180
even on the public health front, there's a debate about what stopped TB.

166
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.070
According to some, including historian,

167
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:06.300
Thomas Macallan TB was stamped out by a cocktail of social and economic

168
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.420
interventions. He points especially to improvements in nutrition,

169
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.070
which strengthened people's immune systems,

170
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.500
thus making them less susceptible to its ravages.

171
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.400
Other scholars pushed back on this interpretation leading to a battle between

172
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:21.090
nutritionists or those who credit the decline of TB to better human resistance

173
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.760
against the disease via improved nutrition, water,

174
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:26.070
and overall standard of living and contagious,

175
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.880
or those who stressed the reduced sources of infection due to a variety of

176
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.140
public health interventions.

177
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.430
Contagion is believed that the declining TV was due to successfully identifying

178
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:37.080
and quarantining afflicted patients.

179
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.290
Vis-a-vis sanatoriums as well as broader public health campaigns with

180
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.580
dispensaries to NGOs regard of what you believe.

181
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:47.270
It's super important to note that it was some form of public health efforts and

182
00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:51.080
not medical intervention that effectively combated this disease for decades

183
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.530
effecting change in everything from workplace safety regulations to improve

184
00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:57.860
sanitation. Sometimes the public health part isn't even intention.

185
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.580
Robert Koch suggested that even housing design could influence how infectious

186
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:05.600
the disease could be. You might be asking, so what we've got drugs now,

187
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:07.100
housing design be damned.

188
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.310
And I'm only a few clinical trials away from getting my bread stick out.

189
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.520
After the antibiotic revolution began in the 1940s,

190
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.760
doctors believed the war on infectious disease to be one,

191
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.300
it was declared a dying field and med students were discouraged from studying

192
00:10:20.301 --> 00:10:20.690
it.

193
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.920
But it's precisely because we declared victory so confidently that we're all,

194
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.380
let's start with something you might've heard of antibiotic resistance in 1950

195
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.900
33 Selman Wachsman developed streptomycin,

196
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.860
an antibiotic that when tested on a TB patient led to full recovery,

197
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.150
according to Snowden this monotherapy or treatment via one rock-solid drug

198
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.120
really seemed like a miracle cure. However, Dr.

199
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:47.990
Soon realized that the TB bacteria what's becoming resistant to the meds.

200
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.160
So folks who underwent treatment or becoming sick again, and what's more,

201
00:10:52.161 --> 00:10:54.860
we're now immune to the only real treatment.

202
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.740
So doctors developed two new medications.

203
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.810
Isoniazid in 1952 and rapamycin in 1963 to

204
00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:07.280
supplement it and began treating patients with all three things in large part to

205
00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:08.114
these discoveries,

206
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.650
TB declined for decades up until the mid 1980s and everyone expected that the

207
00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:16.970
disease would be eradicated by 2010. So we're in the clear, right? Not so fast.

208
00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:21.170
You rascally optimist TB eventually became resistant to all three

209
00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:25.370
medications. And that was about to really hit the proverbial fan.

210
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.810
Nowadays the research laboratory is the focus of public health rather than

211
00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:33.800
social or economic efforts as an article in the American medical journal notes,

212
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.950
departments of public health shed, sanitation housing reform,

213
00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:38.480
and even hospital care.

214
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.530
And now to Burchill losis is back in 1985,

215
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.040
TV cases stopped declining over the next two years.

216
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.660
Rates started rising in the U S and blossomed into a full on pandemic in Eastern

217
00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:54.880
Europe, Southeast Asia and Subsaharan Africa by 1993,

218
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.860
the who declared tuberculosis,

219
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.190
a global emergency so much for eradication.

220
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.690
Remember how people living in poverty were particularly at risk for TB within

221
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:08.710
the U S those most likely to be afflicted where traditionally marginalized and

222
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:12.510
impoverished folks, such as those who are homeless or in prison, what's more,

223
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.230
the emergence of HIV created a brand new class of people who were more

224
00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:17.550
susceptible to the bacteria.

225
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.640
One really illustrative example can be seen in New York city,

226
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.520
which served as an epicenter of an outbreak in the eighties.

227
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.320
The city had experienced a fiscal crisis in 1975 that led to severe budget cuts,

228
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.360
which caused the dismantling of health,

229
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.520
public safety and social service infrastructures,

230
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.850
and the deterioration of living conditions for vulnerable populations.

231
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.120
Most ruinously, the department of health, slashed, budgets,

232
00:12:39.121 --> 00:12:42.690
shuttering district health centers, chest clinics, and the city's TB hospital.

233
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.190
As a result, when the crisis re-emerged existing hospitals were overwhelmed,

234
00:12:47.191 --> 00:12:50.850
had fewer staff and fewer resources to track the treatment of those who were

235
00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:51.930
sick here.

236
00:12:51.931 --> 00:12:56.070
We see why a medical intervention antibiotics is not sufficient in and of itself

237
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.360
in stemming a disease.

238
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.770
You also need proper public health infrastructure to administer the treatment

239
00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:05.910
track the patient's recovery and prevent further spread on a more global scale

240
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:09.870
Snowden also credits the disease re-emergence to the massive displacement caused

241
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:14.220
by refugees, fleeing war economic catastrophe, or environmental disasters,

242
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.480
citing refugee camps as a perfect incubator for spreading the illness or just

243
00:13:18.481 --> 00:13:21.660
reactivating dormant cases in substance here in Africa,

244
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.100
the devastating proliferation of HIV made a huge population vulnerable.

245
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.390
While on Eastern Europe,

246
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.060
the fall of communism dismantled the medical infrastructure,

247
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.450
making it harder to seek treatment for TB to this day,

248
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.130
doctors and scientists face and often drug resistant disease in the absence of

249
00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:42.660
adequate public health infrastructure appears to show no intention of letting up

250
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.710
in 2017,

251
00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:46.950
the world health organization estimated that there were over a half a million

252
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.280
cases of multi-drug resistant TB. So as you can see,

253
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:55.140
the battle against tuberculosis has neither been simple nor entirely successful

254
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.010
in 2018, 10 million folks fell ill from TB.

255
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.980
And 1.5 million died. And importantly,

256
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.430
the history of tuberculosis shows to some extent why waiting for medical

257
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.770
treatments is a gamble. Don't get me wrong.

258
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.550
There's plenty of examples where a baseline public health measure like mass

259
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:14.970
vaccination can make us all chill out and not worry about getting polio.

260
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.120
But the reason TV is so interesting to us is that one,

261
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.210
we see a disease being greatly reduced at first,

262
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:23.790
without any substantial medical intervention. And two,

263
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.780
we see the disease resurging long after we discovered ineffective medical

264
00:14:27.781 --> 00:14:28.440
treatment.

265
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.800
What this shows is how critical public health efforts absent a medical

266
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:36.090
intervention really are to stop the spread of a disease. And as we face down,

267
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.430
COVID 19 collectively holding our breaths,

268
00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:40.710
that of vaccine will manifest before the next football season.

269
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.000
We might get a little too used to relying on medical advancement instead of good

270
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.500
public health infrastructure.

271
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.190
And I'm not just talking about state of calm or the importance of looking like a

272
00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:51.410
bank robbery. I mean,

273
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:55.910
disease trackers who can stop a pandemic before it starts research into diseases

274
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:57.470
emerging in livestock and bats,

275
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.720
affordable distribution of vaccines and treatments. And so,

276
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.450
because if experts are warning us of anything it's that we can expect more novel

277
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:08.210
diseases, infecting humans from our animal friends,

278
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.280
and these might be way different or worse than COVID-19 a big thanks
