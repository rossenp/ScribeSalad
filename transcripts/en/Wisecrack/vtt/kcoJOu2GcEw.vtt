00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.930
<v 1>What's up wisecrack Jared here and today,</v>

4
00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:13.100
we're going to talk about clowns and the IP that made them the stuff of now.

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.890
<v 0>Crusty, I have to warn you people's attitudes have changed about cash.</v>

6
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.251
<v 1>There.</v>

7
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.880
Wasn't the Simpsons that did this to our collective cultural subconscious.

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.200
It was Stephen Kings.

9
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.980
<v 0>Well I'm Pennywise cloud.</v>

10
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.240
<v 1>Originally published as a novel in 1986 and then later adapted to a two-part</v>

11
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.740
mini series in 1990,

12
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.580
it received a facelift recently in the form of two blockbuster films.

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.530
The first film got rave reviews,

14
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.600
racking up a solid 85% on rotten tomatoes and smashing it at the box office.

15
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.380
Did chapter two, repeat the success. We'll let Stephen King answer that.

16
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.720
<v 0>Now. I didn't like the ending.</v>

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.830
<v 1>Yeah, it was disorienting really bad. So what happened? Wisecrack?</v>

18
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.730
How could chapter one hit it out of the park while chapter two struck out

19
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.720
swinging while we could point to a lot of things we think the central problem

20
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:08.510
has to do with the way that horror films are structured.

21
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.300
Welcome to this wisecrack edition on it. Chapter two,

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.840
what went wrong and spoilers ahead for chapters one and two.

23
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.080
Oh and the book as well. But before we get into it,

24
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:19.310

And now back to the show, all right, let's dive into a quick recap of the films.

42
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.580
It chapter one follows a plucky gang of self-described losers.

43
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.730
As they navigate the challenges of growing up in small town, America,

44
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.990
they get bullied fall in love and Oh yeah. Get tormented by this guy.

45
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.080
As it turns out the town of dairy, isn't quite like other towns,

46
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.210
kids are going missing, including Georgie,

47
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:34.340
the younger brother of our lead loser bill,

48
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.240
the cause one very hungry clown named Pennywise.

49
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.750
Bill tries to convince his friends to face this cackling menace in order to save

50
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:42.470
his brother.

51
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.070
But the group disbands after a seriously messed up encounter at Pennywise is

52
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:47.210
crack house of horrors.

53
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.050
<v 0>We'll be better prepared. No, no.</v>

54
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.350
Next time bill you're insane.

55
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.800
<v 1>That is until Beverly gets kidnapped, which forces the team back together.</v>

56
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.670
They then descend into the, overcome their fears,

57
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.030
save Beverly and defeat Pennywise. Well for now,

58
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.560
chapter two picks up 27 years later when Pennywise has come back and the gang

59
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.200
has to reunite in order to beat Pennywise for good,

60
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.620
the group has to collect items that were important to them from childhood and

61
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.250
sacrifice them in some suitably, vague native American ritual.

62
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.610
After the team collects their tokens, they meet up to defeat Pennywise,

63
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.310
except that ritual. Yeah, didn't work.

64
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.040
<v 0>Can we do it? Can we do it? Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.360
Do we do everybody put the tokens in the thing that's good, right?

66
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.323
We did it right.

67
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.690
<v 1>Instead the team is forced to confront their childhood traumas again until they</v>

68
00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:40.260
overcome them and arrive at the convenient realization that Pennywise as a

69
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:44.520
projection of their fear will shape-shift into whatever they think of him. As,

70
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.980
as he triples into a baby clown thing,

71
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.170
the group rips out his heart and crushes it,

72
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.790
thus freeing the town of dairy from the torments of it. Now on paper,

73
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:57.000
these films seem pretty similar. The group gets together,

74
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.790
overcomes their fears and takes down a demonic clown.

75
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.780
So why does this formula work in the first film, but not the second? Well,

76
00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:07.860
we think it has to do with the way structure and timing work both in horror and

77
00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:10.350
in movies at large, as the master of thrills,

78
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.210
Alfred Hitchcock said there is no terror in the bang only in the anticipation

79
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.870
of it.

80
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.160
And it's precisely this understanding of timing or lack thereof that makes

81
00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:23.970
chapter one. So good. And chapter two so bad.

82
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.630
So let's dive in. According to screenwriting guru, John York,

83
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.440
a properly constructed scene should structurally mirror your archetypical three

84
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.970
act film structure to York. Storytelling is ultimately fractal in nature.

85
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.250
Kind of like a pattern that repeats itself,

86
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.070
regardless of the scale in his book into the woods,

87
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.300
he writes stories as a whole illustrate, complete change acts, show,

88
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:49.630
major change, and scenes of minor individual moments. It's in the latter.

89
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.330
The single cells of the organism that a writer's effort is concentrated for each

90
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:58.620
is a unit of change. And just as a movie is usually told in three acts.

91
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.790
So can a scene usually be divided into three main parts? First,

92
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.840
our protagonist wants to do something only to be boarded by another character or

93
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:09.510
force of antagonism before a choice is made.

94
00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:11.970
And one of those two opposing forces gives way.

95
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.700
Now it's important to note that this tripartite structure,

96
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:16.920
isn't a hard and fast rule, frankly,

97
00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:18.990
there are as many ways to formulate a scene.

98
00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:21.510
As there are fast and furious movies. That being said,

99
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:25.470
we found that a good scare can usually be broken down in this way while a bad

100
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:28.350
one. Usually rejects it to see this in action though,

101
00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:31.200
we need to examine some key scenes from both movies.

102
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.310
Perhaps the most iconic scene of both films is the opening scare for chapter

103
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:39.360
one. In this iconic moment, we see the three-part structure pretty clearly.

104
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.710
First let's start with the action. Georgie wants his boat back to that end.

105
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:47.430
He answers Pennywise has seemingly harmless questions about his life and his

106
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.360
friends.

107
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.530
<v 0>I bet you have a lot of friends, three of my brothers, my best ex,</v>

108
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:53.783
where is he.

109
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.470
<v 1>Throughout this exchange? We aren't scared per se, but it's easy to that.</v>

110
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:00.860
Tension is building. Of course, Georgie is rightly skeptical.

111
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.100
That is until Pennywise insists. They're not strangers.

112
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.070
<v 0>Meet George Georgie, meet Pennywise.</v>

113
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.990
<v 1>This launches us into the second phase reaction Pennywise insists on building a</v>

114
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:14.561
rapport.

115
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:18.400
And the two of them start actually getting on much to our increased heart rate

116
00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:21.400
and dread. They talk about the circus and popcorn

117
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.300
that is until Pennywise gets hungry.

118
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.240
This is the halfway point of our reaction phase,

119
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.570
where momentum shifts and our stomachs really dropped to the floor.

120
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.770
We then have to watch as Pennywise convinces Georgie to reach into the drain for

121
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:38.230
his boat. Georgie is going to have to make a choice.

122
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.600
And that's when the first real scare happens.

123
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.170
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

124
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.500
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

125
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.240
to say the least it's effective and propels us to our third and final component

126
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.880
turning point. The momentum has shifted.

127
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.920
Pennywise has come out on top as a one-armed Georgie whales and tries to escape

128
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.670
the music crescendos. And we are left with one terrifying image.

129
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.530
Almost every successful scare in chapter one follows this three-part structure.

130
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.490
Consider the scene in which Eddie strolls past the Wellhouse naturally.

131
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.090
Eddie wants to get the F out of there while the well house. Well,

132
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.890
the house has its own ideas.

133
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.593
<v 0>No.</v>

134
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.950
<v 1>So Eddie tries to leave, and this is our action beat,</v>

135
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.670
but he ends up fumbling his pill bottle while scrambling to pick up his

136
00:07:24.671 --> 00:07:28.330
medicine, though, he's greeted by the force of antagonism. In this case,

137
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.960
a lever, this is our reaction beat, and it sends a running.

138
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.650
The only problem is that he's now running in the backyard of the well house and

139
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.440
Oh yeah, there's a chain link fence back there.

140
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.460
This is our turning point where our protagonist and antagonist are pitted

141
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.570
against each other. And that antagonist, well that's Pennywise.

142
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.430
Now that's scary.

143
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.120
This payoff is all the more satisfying and scary precisely because it was

144
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:54.880
proceeded by mounting moments of terror. Of course,

145
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:57.670
just when it seems Eddie's about to go the way of young Georgie,

146
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.200
he finds a hole in the gate and escapes though, undoubtedly scarred for life.

147
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.860
But while chapter one is clearly competent at structuring scares,

148
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.400
chapter two is quite a bit messier. Let's break down the scene.

149
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:12.790
When up Richie returns to his childhood arcade to collect his token,

150
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.970
while there he has a flashback in which you were called playing video games with

151
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:19.600
another kid only to have that kid call them out in front of Bowers as gay.

152
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.610
<v 0>Dude. Are you being weird? I'm not your boyfriend. Woo aye.</v>

153
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.660
<v 1>Then Bowers, shouts Richie out of the arcade, leaving him to wander the park.</v>

154
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.260
Oh right. And Richie then gets chased by a demonic lumberjack statue.

155
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.820
I think my pants,

156
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.790
if you're wondering why this part wasn't particularly terrifying.

157
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:38.440
It's not because the Brawny towel dude,

158
00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:42.190
isn't a little frightening it's because the film doesn't build into the scare.

159
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.220
None of the action in the arcade primes us for the scare.

160
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.180
So when our lumberjack comes out swinging, it seems pretty much out of nowhere,

161
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.840
but it's not like this lack of an effective three-part structure is an isolated

162
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:55.380
event in chapter two, whether it's bill reliving,

163
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:57.960
his trauma or Eddie going for round two with the leper,

164
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.710
each scene reaches a scare in the turning point stage that has nothing to do

165
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:05.430
with the antagonist in the action or reaction stages. For example,

166
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:08.730
let's look at when Ben reminisces about hiding out in a classroom with Beverly

167
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.830
minus a small false scare here. The conflict,

168
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.170
the scene revolves around Ben wanting to tell Beverly his true feelings.

169
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.020
We have the action in which Ben is worried about how they'll get on.

170
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.570
Then the reaction which Beverly says it should be fine.

171
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:23.400
As long as the two of them can still hang out.

172
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.270
Then decision time is the turning point has been decides to lean in for the kiss

173
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.410
and gets rejected.

174
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.530
<v 2>He thought it could like someone is fat and gross and disgusting like you.</v>

175
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.400
<v 1>And that's where the film attempts to get scary out of nowhere.</v>

176
00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:38.930
Beverly decides to go all ghost,

177
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.030
which leads to Ben sharing a locker with Pennywise confusing. Yes. Scary.

178
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.850
No, sure. There might be a three beat structure to this scene,

179
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:50.870
but these beats don't build to the final scare largely because beats one and two

180
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.260
feel like they were ripped from a teenage romance novel. Instead of these beats,

181
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.020
focusing on a potential scare they're focused on the will.

182
00:09:57.021 --> 00:10:00.380
They won't they aspect of Beverly and Ben's relationship. Of course,

183
00:10:00.381 --> 00:10:03.800
there are other places in chapter two where the film seems to get this right

184
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.080
only to later throw it out the window,

185
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.010
take the scene where Beverly revisits her childhood home after Beverly low-key,

186
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:12.620
vandalizes her old bedroom to find her token.

187
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.260
She sits down for tea with the apartments, new owner,

188
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.800
one sweaty older woman in pursuit of a sinister seeming,

189
00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:20.570
but unspecified end.

190
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.120
<v 2>But you know what they say about Derek?</v>

191
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.650
No one who dies here ever really dies.

192
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.340
<v 1>The conversation starts pleasantly, but quickly becomes uncomfortable.</v>

193
00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:34.520
When the woman brings up death and starts fanning her corpse like chest.

194
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.150
This is the action phase. Beverly sensing something is wrong.

195
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:42.500
Then tries to excuse herself. The reaction phase here dread is building.

196
00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:45.560
As we see Pennywise in a photo and the old woman shimmying naked in the

197
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:49.580
backdrop, one has to give Beverly or our naked septuagenarian.

198
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.570
Unsurprisingly it's Beverly the old woman comes out screaming like Baba Yaga.

199
00:10:53.571 --> 00:10:56.060
And Beverly is on the run. Now. Yes,

200
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.900
all of this fits York's formulation of action reaction turning point.

201
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.650
The only problem though, is that this correctly structured scare was buried.

202
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:06.140
Any more confusing series of scenes.

203
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.800
It was proceeded by a tense flashback of Beverly and her abusive father.

204
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.100
And it was followed up immediately by a strange conversation with Pennywise.

205
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.950
<v 2>You haven't [inaudible].</v>

206
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.171
<v 1>Taken together.</v>

207
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:21.830
This scare was lost in the mix of different conflicts and rising tensions.

208
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.370
So I think it's fair to say that the scene structure of chapter one is one of

209
00:11:25.371 --> 00:11:29.000
the film's strengths while structure and chapter two is one of its weaknesses.

210
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.600
But now let's go back to York's concept of fractal storytelling.

211
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.710
That is this three part structure repeats itself, not just in scenes,

212
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.140
but also the film as a whole. Now of course,

213
00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:41.300
both films do have a three-act structure,

214
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.770
but what makes chapter one so good and chapter two so bad is the spacing of

215
00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:49.550
these scares within their respective acts just as every fright needs an earlier

216
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.650
up in the scene. So two does every scary scene need a setup in the act,

217
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.150
too many frightening scenes in a row.

218
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:58.300
When you run into a problem with diminishing returns. On the other hand,

219
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.250
if there's too long of a drought between your stairs,

220
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.180
you start to lose the tension and the script unsurprisingly chapter one suffers

221
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:05.410
from neither of these problems.

222
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.710
While chapter two suffers from both of them to prove this point,

223
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:13.210
let's compare the first act of chapter one to the first act of chapter two and

224
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:13.841
chapter one,

225
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:16.870
the first act runs from the beginning right up until the gang realizes they've

226
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:20.110
all been terrorized by the same clown. Meanwhile, in chapter two,

227
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:23.470
act one spans from the opening until Bev tells everyone they're doomed to die.

228
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.260
And Mike proposes his stupid ritual, the ritual of church.

229
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.810
So how many scares were contained in each film's first act in chapter one?

230
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:35.470
The answer is a healthy eight scares or roughly a scare every eight or so

231
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:39.850
minutes in chapter two, there are four scares or a scare every 15 minutes.

232
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.240
And some of these scenes, while it's hard to say, if they were actually frights.

233
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.150
I mean, honestly is Pennywise showing up to eat a drowning man,

234
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.510
really a horror scene, or is he just depended to a cliched scene of violence,

235
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:51.490
small town homophobia, even worse.

236
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.360
Only one of these scares actually happens to our main cast of characters when

237
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:58.810
monsters emerge from their fortune cookies. And if you're wondering, no,

238
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:00.730
there's no action reaction buildup to it.

239
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.733
<v 2>Is that man.</v>

240
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.200
<v 1>Instead of building to periodic scares,</v>

241
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.710
the first act of chapter two is unusually obsessed with comedic gags.

242
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.220
<v 2>Okay. I love you mommy. What.</v>

243
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.700
<v 1>The interpersonal relationships between its characters.</v>

244
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.330
This wouldn't be so bad except that it has the weird effect of further diluting.

245
00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:20.520
What little tension there is in the first act,

246
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.550
this general lack of frites in the first act of chapter two,

247
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:26.310
however only creates bigger structural problems.

248
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.510
And its second act typically act one is used to establish our characters along

249
00:13:30.511 --> 00:13:33.360
with their flaws and motivations. In chapter one,

250
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:36.030
we learned that bill was obsessed with finding his missing brother.

251
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.490
<v 2>It's the only place that, that, that Georgia could have ended up.</v>

252
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.570
<v 1>While we get to know about the rest of our ensemble cast through their run-ins</v>

253
00:13:45.571 --> 00:13:48.930
with Pennywise. Eddie is haunted by a leper and his fear of germs.

254
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.000
Mike is haunted by the fire that killed his parents.

255
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.360
And Beverly is haunted by her father and her nascent sexuality

256
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.480
By combining character introductions with terrifying moments,

257
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.280
chapter one manages to keep audiences engaged in its first act and masterfully

258
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:12.210
sets up act two for our characters have to face the forces of antagonism.

259
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.700
Head-on unfortunately for chapter two, though,

260
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.480
the film didn't give us these introductory run-ins with Pennywise until act two.

261
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.080
That means instead of watching our heroes fight back in the second act like they

262
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:23.850
did in the Wellhouse in chapter one,

263
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.200
we have to rewatch their character introductions worst because chapter two has

264
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.630
to cram these moments all into its second act.

265
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:35.640
The horror feels formulaic and repetitive because let's be real jump scares.

266
00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:36.301
Aren't great.

267
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:40.440
When we watch them back to back to back with acts one and two lagging in terms

268
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:41.340
of plot development,

269
00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:45.660
it's no surprise then that the third activit chapter two also falls flat as

270
00:14:45.661 --> 00:14:46.381
Billy Wilder.

271
00:14:46.381 --> 00:14:49.890
The iconic screenwriter from the golden age of Hollywood said if you have a

272
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:51.150
problem with the third act,

273
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.320
the real problem is in the first act because chapter two,

274
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:58.340
didn't give our heroes a proper introduction and goal in the first act and asked

275
00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:01.550
to play some massive catch-up in the second act. As a result.

276
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:03.020
When we arrive at the third act,

277
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:06.740
when our characters have to make the choice to stare down our antagonist or left

278
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:09.920
feeling like not much has happened, the team goes back to dairy.

279
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.190
Each one collects their own token and then they all meet at the warehouse for

280
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:14.060
the final battle.

281
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.670
<v 0>Has killed in clown. But.</v>

282
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.380
<v 1>Without the buildup in the prior acts,</v>

283
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:21.050
this turning point feels anticlimactic our group.

284
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:23.390
Hasn't had to overcome any real opposition.

285
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.500
So their decision to face Pennywise doesn't bear the same weight worse because

286
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:29.630
the ritual doesn't even work in the first place.

287
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.660
We're wondering why they didn't just face off earlier and save us an hour of

288
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:34.490
time and that face off. Yeah,

289
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:37.430
we already watched the group beat the lights out of the clown in the first film.

290
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.450
<v 0>Now you're the one who's afraid. Ultimately.</v>

291
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.920
<v 1>Chapter two is rife with poorly structured scenes that when combined make for</v>

292
00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:49.300
poorly structured acts that when combined make for very disappointed moviegoers,
