00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>This video is brought to you by surf shark, VPN</v>

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.260
What's up,

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.500
why's crack Jared here to talk about one of the dumber conspiracy theories we've

4
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:13.610
ever come across.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.470
The idea that 5g has caused the global pandemic known as COVID-19.

6
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.860
Um, all these desperate times are full of snake oil salesman.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.780
This one perhaps takes the cake meet Thomas Cowan Thomas'

8
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:27.111
video,

9
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:31.940
claiming that 5g causes COVID-19 had over half a million views on YouTube before

10
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:35.360
being taken down. And that idea with the help of celebrities like Woody,

11
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:38.180
Harrelson is gaining traction in the UK.

12
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:42.320
People have torched several 5g towers for its alleged role in the pandemic.

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.200
<v 1>The UK has reported around 50 fires,</v>

14
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.350
targeting towers and other 5g equipment. Okay.

15
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.840
<v 0>Of course, this is all bonkers and we'll get to that,</v>

16
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.560
but we nonetheless wanted to dive deep into what exactly these people are saying

17
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:55.394
and why,

18
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.050
because the line between science and non-science is not as easy to discern as

19
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:02.780
one might think. So how can we tell the difference?

20
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.350
Let's find out welcome to this wisecrack edition on the anatomy of

21
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.140
pseudoscience, but before we get into it,

22
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:12.020
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor surf shark VPN.

23
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.350
A VPN is a virtual private network,

24
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.850
a tool that can be used to connect to the internet securely.

25
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.650
When you connect to the internet with a VPN,

26
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:22.400
your IP address and other valuable data are encrypted protecting you against

27
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:23.150
hackers.

28
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
This means you can safely use your banking info without fear of a leaked pin

29
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.710
surf shark goes above and beyond your typical VPN by offering extra services

30
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:31.580
like kill switch,

31
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.550
which disables your internet connection when your VPN stops working.

32
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.960
So you're always protected.

33
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.830
They also offer an ad and cookie blockers that sites can't collect data or

34
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:40.850
target you with ads.

35
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.390
The best part about surf shark is that you only need one subscription to connect

36
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:48.860
to an unlimited amount of devices. You can connect on your computer phone, iPad,

37
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:50.270
or even your gaming console,

38
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.750

41
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.560
let's get back to Thomas. His pitch is simple. When our cells get sick,

42
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.890
they excrete toxins and 5g is poisoning.

43
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:12.950
Those cells causing them to poop out his words.

44
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.410
<v 1>The body is pooping out poisons.</v>

45
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.770
It's obviously not good to eat other people's Pope.

46
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.820
<v 0>Sins that make us sick with a little thing called COVID-19.</v>

47
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.200
In his many YouTube videos, he makes a series of incredible claims.

48
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.200
They include viruses don't cause diseases.

49
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.460
The Spanish flu that killed tens of millions was caused by the electrification

50
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.120
of the earth and radio waves because we're electrical beings.

51
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.170
Other major outbreaks in the last century were caused by said electrification.

52
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.910
Also, he's an anti-vaxxer obviously the most outlandish part about this is how

53
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.910
technology has caused all these infectious diseases,

54
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.350
especially given the many fun and exciting infectious diseases that were among

55
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:59.030
the leading causes of death, pre electricity, like smallpox, bubonic plague,

56
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.850
or the measles to be fair.

57
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.620
Proving diseases existed before radio doesn't prove radios can't make us sick,

58
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.970
but Cowen's entire worldview seems to be natural equals good.

59
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.820
Like when he talks about all the pure water we used to drink,

60
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.170
there was no toxic stuff dissolved in the water and conveniently forgets.

61
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.220
The thousands of years,

62
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.280
people would drop dead of drinking water teaming with pathogens from your

63
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:25.450
upstream neighbors, you might be asking, how do people fall for this?

64
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.800
You might respond. They're stupid. But I think this excuse is lazy.

65
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.910
Plenty of smart and thoughtful people fall for pseudo-scientific nonsense.

66
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.290
And you probably will.

67
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.970
At some point in your life do the same suit of science often looks like real

68
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:44.170
science experts will be trotted out MDs PhDs from real

69
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:47.080
universities they'll even have evidence and studies.

70
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.890
But one of the most interesting things about pseudoscience is the use and abuse

71
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.160
of this evidence and the basic problem of context.

72
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.140
So let's talk about context.

73
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.710
There's one pretty illustrative example from Netflix's goop series.

74
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.750
In one episode and energy healer insists that his 100% not scientifically backed

75
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:09.100
energy healing process of waving his hands over your body really does work by

76
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:13.330
using a rock solid piece of evidence. The double slit experiment.

77
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.240
<v 2>One foundational study is called the double slit experiment proved in Paraguay</v>

78
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.190
without a shadow of a doubt that our consciousness actually shifts or

79
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.100
alters in some way, shape or form physical reality.

80
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.400
<v 0>You might remember this experiment mentioned in high school or college physics,</v>

81
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:33.360
but the takeaway is this light can act like a particle or wave,

82
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.160
but if observed it will collapse into its particle state that this proves our

83
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:42.330
mind can affect the material world is well not completely bogus,

84
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:45.420
but so vague that it could be construed to mean anything.

85
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.920
Our consciousness affects physical reality all the time as it instructs my Palm

86
00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:53.880
to cover my face in complete disbelief that Netflix aired the show.

87
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.850
<v 2>She threw up from 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM.</v>

88
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.900
<v 0>But sadness aside, such a claim relies on a few things.</v>

89
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.940
One a misunderstanding of the context of the experiment light collapses into a

90
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:09.660
single stage because it has to interact with the measuring tool, observing it,

91
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.550
not because our consciousness willed it to be so to a large interpretive

92
00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:18.570
leap that goes above and beyond the extremely limited hypothesis that the

93
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:23.400
experiment is testing Q the science explaining text on screen and the use of the

94
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:24.600
word implies.

95
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.160
Let's just say you could we'll light to be a particle or wave by thinking it

96
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.270
does an experiment that proves this mean you can make weird puppet gestures to

97
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:38.700
cure people's ailments. No,

98
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.500
the basic problem is this pseudoscience often preys on the fact that victims are

99
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.970
educated. For instance,

100
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.810
anti-vaxxers tend to be more educated than their well vaccinated peers.

101
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.380
We all can't be quantum theory, experts or immunologists.

102
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.400
So instead they give us evidence that often conforms to our basic understanding

103
00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:57.234
of science.

104
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.220
So when energy Healy man explains the energy that runs through our muscles,

105
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.860
it seems to vaguely sound like our understanding of.

106
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.960
<v 3>Of anatomy. You have energy,</v>

107
00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:09.850
that's bound up in the muscles and ligaments and spine and fascia and organs.

108
00:06:09.851 --> 00:06:11.020
When you're under stress.

109
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.360
<v 0>Stretch the applicability of that evidence by making huge logical leaps based on</v>

110
00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:17.380
the evidence they presented.

111
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.050
<v 4>Bristol's vibrate at different levels,</v>

112
00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:24.970
depending on their composition and color as to the cells in the human

113
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.630
body.

114
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.350
<v 0>Excessive pseudoscience, praise, not on the fact that people are dumb,</v>

115
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.820
but that we are completely incapable of knowing every scientific principle that

116
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:37.180
intersects with our lives. I have a headache. I take a Tylenol,

117
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.680
but I personally have zero idea how the biochemistry involved makes it better

118
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.641
with that in mind,

119
00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:46.600
let's get into the profound lack of context implicit in the idea that it isn't

120
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:48.700
viruses that cause COVID-19,

121
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.820
but 5g will have to start with the question.

122
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.620
How do we know what viruses cause what illnesses before the 18 hundreds people

123
00:06:56.621 --> 00:07:00.250
had basically no idea what was making most people sick. Sure.

124
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:01.390
They had some theories,

125
00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:05.440
but it wasn't until the 17 and 18 hundreds that a series of discoveries vastly

126
00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:08.560
expanded our knowledge of the microbial world that was killing us.

127
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.610
You probably remember Louie pastor as the guy that discovered heating up milk

128
00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:14.800
would make sure your cow juice wouldn't murder you,

129
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.790
but his experiments help the formation of the germ theory of disease.

130
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.650
Notably pastor had a rival named Robert Koch who was also looking into the tiny

131
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.060
murderous world around us.

132
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.900
Koch's work in microbiology is the entire reason why we know when you've got,

133
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:33.850
say the flu instead of COVID and it's Robert Koch who Cowan sites to

134
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:38.710
support his claims that COVID-19 isn't caused by a virus, cocaine,

135
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.390
his peers were faced with the question,

136
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.410
how exactly does a scientist determine of all the millions of organisms in our

137
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:46.690
body? Which one is making us sick?

138
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.250
Koch had four simple rules known as Koch's postulates one.

139
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.910
We can suspect a specific microorganism of causing an illness.

140
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.570
If we can find that organism in all the cases of that illness,

141
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.170
but that's not enough because there are many different microorganisms in all of

142
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:04.420
our bodies, which brings us to two.

143
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.680
You have to be able to isolate this microorganism and grow it in a pure culture.

144
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.500
Let's say you've got someone suffering from COVID-19.

145
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.910
You can take a nasal sample,

146
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.810
filter out the other organisms and grow some disease juice in a Petri dish.

147
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.620
Three, the culture of microbe will cause disease in a healthy host.

148
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.550
Now modern scientists often don't want to intentionally make people sick with

149
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:25.600
their ethics and all.

150
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.590
So instead they might introduce their disease Jews to some healthy lab cells or

151
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.710
sadly a monkey rat or some other animal.

152
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:37.420
And see if they develop COVID-19 symptoms for you're able to watch as your newly

153
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:41.890
infected organism produces enough virus or bacteria for you to once again,

154
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.000
isolated in a Petri dish, making a brand new batch of disease juice,

155
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.180
and in line with making logical leaps from real science,

156
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.980
Cowan uses Koch's postulates as a reason to explain why COVID and the flu are

157
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:58.140
hoaxes for one, he claims that in Boston, during the Spanish flu,

158
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.710
they suck the snot out of people and injected it into healthy people.

159
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.360
Eliciting no symptoms that would make it disqualified by Koch's third postulate,

160
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.410
except well, we looked at that paper and the author pretty much says,

161
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.530
I'm pretty sure we're doing everything wrong. Ironically,

162
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.980
the whole reason people found the virus that caused the flu was Koch's

163
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:20.970
postulates unsure of what was causing everyone to get sick with the Spanish flu.

164
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.410
Some suspected a bacteria called Pfeiffer's bacillus while others suspected a

165
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:27.750
specific virus. Importantly,

166
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.770
bacteria are much larger than viruses so they can be filtered out with tiny

167
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:35.820
little virus sized holds true to Koch's postulate. In 1918,

168
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.480
two French researchers were able to infect monkeys in a human with their

169
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:43.620
isolated bacteria, free virus, Jews who subsequently got sick,

170
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.580
thus giving strong evidence that the flu was caused by the influenza virus

171
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.460
instead of Pfeiffer's bacillus. Additionally,

172
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.910
other researchers help rule out Pfeiffer's bacillus because they found it in all

173
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:58.170
kinds of people without the flu, thus violating Coke's first postulate.

174
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.770
It's important to note how these findings come about because of a community of

175
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:06.180
scientists and not a lone study or researcher Koch's postulates were not only

176
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:08.850
critical a hundred years ago. They're critical today.

177
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.430
When researchers in Korea wanted to figure out what was,

178
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:13.380
what we now call COVID-19.

179
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.790
They isolated a virus that looked a lot like SARS and infected healthy lab cells

180
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:22.230
to fulfill part of Koch's postulates, that virus, they called SARS cov,

181
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.700
who researchers have also claimed to successfully infect monkeys and rats.

182
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.480
Koch's postulates are not perfect though. And even he realized this,

183
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.140
for instance, some people contract infections, but don't show symptoms.

184
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.020
And while we might want to say, boom, Coke, debunked.

185
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.170
There's plenty of other reasons to believe that microorganisms are still

186
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:43.020
infectious without effecting everyone who contracts them.

187
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.470
Like when I searched an Irish cook managed to give typhoid to a bunch of the

188
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:50.910
families she cooked for despite being perfectly healthy or how some viruses can

189
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:54.660
go dormant in our bodies like herpes before becoming active. Again,

190
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.260
scientists often debate how to best tweak Koch's postulates,

191
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.280
modern techniques like sequencing the genome of a suspected virus and comparing

192
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:06.870
it to genetically similar viruses like comparing COVID-19 to SARS can provide

193
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:09.660
evidence for identifying the microbial causes of an illness,

194
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.820
not even Dremel in Coke's time,

195
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.390
but to people like Cowan playing it fast and loose with the scientific

196
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:16.500
principles they dish out.

197
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.460
We'll say things like Koch's postulates assert that 100% of people with the

198
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:24.690
virus or bacteria should have symptoms and idea that not even Coke believed.

199
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.740
And of course there's little to no experimental evidence that suggests viruses

200
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:29.820
are just cell poop.

201
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.660
And I'm unaware of anyone blasting lab cells with 5g waves that was able to

202
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:37.250
produce the novel coronavirus from nothing like our energy healer.

203
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.450
How points to real research to imply that he's correct.

204
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.740
But here's our favorite part of the story. Cowan is a medical doctor.

205
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.450
He went to medical school.

206
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.620
He should have the medical context for why these claims are completely bonkers,

207
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.060
but it's also worth noting.

208
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.370
Most doctors are not research scientists and their training focuses on rote

209
00:11:57.371 --> 00:12:01.300
memorization, not critical thinking or modern research techniques.

210
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.780
And this is at least part of the reason you can find plenty of people with

211
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:08.920
medical degrees saying the dumbest things about vaccines or Corona virus.

212
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.880
They think simply being armed with the facts in a vacuum will lead them to the

213
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:15.880
right conclusion, which brings us to the problem of evidence.

214
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.120
We're never really taught to think critically about evidence and how it should

215
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:23.110
shape our understanding of the world to figure out why let's consider Cowen's

216
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:26.980
evidence. First. He claims that 5g was launched in Wu Han China,

217
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:30.280
where COVID originated aside from the fact that this is just wrong.

218
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.060
As 5g services previously existed in parts of the U S and South Korea.

219
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.920
This is allegedly correlational evidence as,

220
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.660
as a series of pandemics that coincided with radio and other technology.

221
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.750
At this point in the video, countless Lords have likely,

222
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:48.430
already commented LOL correlation. Doesn't equal causation, and that's true,

223
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.830
but correlation is important evidence,

224
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.330
evidence that we use all the time and the fact that places which have no 5g are

225
00:12:55.331 --> 00:13:00.100
also experiencing COVID outbreaks is evidence that this specific correlation is

226
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.780
bull let's turn back to Cowan slam dunk on how the Boston researchers couldn't

227
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:09.010
deliberately infect people with the flu, not even with their gross flutes,

228
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.300
not this evidence has meant to cast out on the prevailing idea that viruses are

229
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:16.300
infectious. If a virus isn't giving people the flu,

230
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.500
then surely something else must be like the radio.

231
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.510
What should we make of all this evidence?

232
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.970
One route is just to call it bad evidence.

233
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.830
No 5g existed elsewhere before Wu Han no correlation doesn't equal

234
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:33.160
causation, but there's something else going on here that we've seen a lot.

235
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.070
And people like Cowan energy healers and flat earthers,

236
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.220
a fetishization of the crucial experiment.

237
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.630
<v 5>We could simply get one of these ring, laser gyroscopes.</v>

238
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.490
We would be able to prove once. And for all that,

239
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.200
there is no rotation to the earth.

240
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.250
<v 0>Crucial experiment was an idea set forth by Francis bacon. Who many of you know,</v>

241
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:54.060
as the scientific method guy, you've probably heard a story like this.

242
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.700
People have some outdated or wrong idea,

243
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.780
and someone has a Eureka moment designing an experiment to settle the case once.

244
00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:04.680
And for all think Newton with his prism, proving his theory of light,

245
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.210
or if your energy guide,

246
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:09.990
the double slit experiment is the crucial experiment that proves you can realign

247
00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:11.610
people's energy by snapping.

248
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.830
<v 5>I I'm making sounds with my hands.</v>

249
00:14:13.831 --> 00:14:17.760
I'm putting energy into the field around some of these body.

250
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.550
<v 0>Well, science is full of these important experiments.</v>

251
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.420
The problem with crucial experiments is that they rarely if ever exists.

252
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.860
As we understand them.

253
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.910
This all speaks to the basic problem in science known as under determination,

254
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.020
which the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy defines as the simple idea that

255
00:14:34.021 --> 00:14:37.860
the evidence available to us at a given time may be insufficient to determine

256
00:14:37.861 --> 00:14:40.440
what beliefs we should hold in response to it.

257
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.350
This idea originates from the work of peer doom,

258
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.550
a French physicist who argues that when one performs an experiment and tests a

259
00:14:47.551 --> 00:14:48.390
hypothesis,

260
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.420
there's never one single hypothesis being when one wants to test the idea that

261
00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:54.620
the flu is infectious.

262
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.350
One might cough on a healthy person to see if they get sick,

263
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.490
but there is an innumerable amount of assumptions and hypothesis embedded in any

264
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:05.240
simple test, for instance, that the flu virus travels via air,

265
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.580
that it's always present in a sick person's lung or throat sick person is always

266
00:15:09.581 --> 00:15:13.900
infectious. That virus has exist. And so on. When an experiment fails,

267
00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:17.440
do them argues. It's impossible to say where the failure lies.

268
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.800
Let's unpack within the context of our Boston flu experiment,

269
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.030
putting someone's snot into someone's body rests on all kinds of hypotheses and

270
00:15:25.031 --> 00:15:25.864
assumptions.

271
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.190
Reading the paper has the author as a good scientist asking questions about what

272
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.240
kind of assumptions he incorrectly made about the flu does transporting said

273
00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:37.750
mucus for four hours somehow harm the flu virus, where the people,

274
00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:40.390
they try to infect already exposed without knowing it.

275
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.810
Do people stop being contagious even while they're sick. Thus,

276
00:15:43.811 --> 00:15:47.770
the conclusion that the flu is not infectious was not even considered by the

277
00:15:47.771 --> 00:15:49.150
performer of the experiment.

278
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.380
All it really shows was how little they knew about the flu and viral infections,

279
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.770
which would hopefully encourage scientists to dig deeper and deeper.

280
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.280
It's also important to remember that science happens.

281
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.880
People build conclusions from evidence, and unfortunately this is a prime way.

282
00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:08.230
Human bias and dumb mastery can enter the scientific process and a complete

283
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.870
ignorance of how human bias easily enters.

284
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:14.800
The scientific process has led to some of science's worst mishaps.

285
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.790
I want to stress this slam dunk flu evidence from Cowan because this kind of

286
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:19.270
tactic,

287
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:24.010
isn't just a common refrain for anti-vaxxers energy healers or the 5g causes

288
00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:24.790
COVID people,

289
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.660
but almost every talking head you've seen on television and YouTube. Seriously,

290
00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:31.120
just look at any video with owns in the title,

291
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.930
and you'll likely find some pundit or straight up quack offering a hand full of

292
00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:38.020
key studies that thoroughly debunked the other side.

293
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.930
But the problem is science doesn't work like this.

294
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.650
Science is not an issue individual process where one scientist performs a

295
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.820
crucial experiment and changes the game it's done with other scientists,

296
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.240
but we pastor and Robert Koch would have been relegated to the dustbin of

297
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:54.100
history. If their ideas about germs,

298
00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:57.850
weren't built upon by countless experiments and theorization of their peers,

299
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.850
not only peers who replicated their experiments,

300
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.510
but built upon their techniques as they went looking for microbes developed

301
00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:07.900
vaccines and looked for evidence that poked holes in their theories,

302
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.440
even the French researchers who isolated the flu virus would have been long

303
00:17:11.441 --> 00:17:15.850
forgotten. If their evidence wasn't corroborated and built upon an entire way,

304
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.280
web of knowledge is built as historian.

305
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:21.910
Naomi arrestees writes summarizing [inaudible] work experiments.

306
00:17:21.911 --> 00:17:26.530
Simply tell us if a theory is confirmed or weakened by the facts. Um,

307
00:17:26.531 --> 00:17:29.380
you see someone touting and experiment that seemingly upends,

308
00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:32.590
everything we know, Oh, about one thing or another ask yourself,

309
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.820
does it really many conspiracy theories have a smoking gun like Andrew

310
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.740
Wakefield's discredited study linking autism to the MMR vaccine or Cowan slam

311
00:17:41.741 --> 00:17:43.870
dunk of a study from a hundred years ago,

312
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.500
if pseudoscience is appealing because it latches on to scientific principles

313
00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:49.000
that we vaguely remember from high,

314
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.430
the full context of those principles is what often makes pseudoscience fall

315
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.030
apart. It's the web of knowledge, not individual facts,

316
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.150
studies or tests that makes science robust.

317
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.170
So when Calen points to the very basic principles of virology to disprove the

318
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:06.690
idea that COVID-19 is an infectious disease,

319
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.920
it's only the context of those principles that can save us. And for scientist,

320
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.160
arrestee says, it's not just on them to tell the world what they know,

321
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.420
but how they know it.

322
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.680
There's the constant refrain and a lot of battle alarmism that we don't know the

323
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:20.820
effects of this thing.

324
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.600
And while plenty of corporations have put out products that accidentally killed

325
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:29.130
a bunch of people, the answer is not to invent a cause out of thin 5g Laden air.

326
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:29.881
Of course,

327
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:34.230
Thomas Cowen's idea that an untested technology is dangerous to human health and

328
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:35.340
should be stopped at all.

329
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:40.170
Costs is also incredibly ironic because his own medical license was put on

330
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:42.930
probation. After he suggested a patient with breast cancer,

331
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:46.470
take a drug that has never gone through any safety trials without even

332
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:48.930
suggesting to the patient. It might be dangerous.

333
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.650
He also did so without ever consulting the patient's medical records or

334
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:56.250
performing an in-person examination. Whoops,

335
