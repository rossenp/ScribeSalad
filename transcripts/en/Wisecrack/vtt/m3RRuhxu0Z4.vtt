<v 0>This video is brought to you by Ray con</v>

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.260
Hey, wisecrack, Jared here and today,

3
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:12.830
we're talking about the film that introduced us to Hollywood sweetest stash.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.230
Her spike Jones is 2013.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.190
Saifai romance is pretty well-regarded for its uniquely non dystopian view of

6
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:19.850
the future.

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.420
And because Jones so effectively brings a computer voice to life in the form of

8
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:24.590
scar Joe, Samantha,

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.670
the film is often considered primarily to be an exploration of what makes a

10
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:32.810
human being. I E does Samantha possess humanity? Ironically,

11
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:35.780
we'd argue that the film is actually more about a computer teaching,

12
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:38.690
a human how to love. It sounds counterintuitive,

13
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.400
but we'll explain welcoming this wisecrack condition on her and as always

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.580
spoilers ahead. But before we get into it,

15
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:48.140
I want to give a shout out to this week's sponsor.

19
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.590

but Ray con earbuds are compact, discreet, and most importantly, comfortable.

35
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.060
And now back to the show. All right, guys, let's do a very quick recap.

36
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.930
Her tells the story of Theodore Trombley, a professional letter writer,

37
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:53.810
trying to pick himself up from the rebel of a failed marriage.

38
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.260
Little does he know that the woman of his dreams might just be a few clicks

39
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:58.010
away,

40
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.120
an artificially intelligent operating system named Samantha Theo's story is

41
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.080
about his struggles with making and maintaining a long-term connection through

42
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.540
his failed marriage and his relationship with Samantha.

43
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.600
He comes to learn something about not who to love,

44
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.760
but how to love lucky for us.

45
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.720
Our German fellow named Erich Fromm wrote a whole book about this back in 1956,

46
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.530
called the art of loving, and it can help us to better understand Jones.

47
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.270
His film born in 1900 from was a psychologist and thinker who combined Sigmund

48
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:26.571
Freud,

49
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:30.290
psychoanalytical theories with Eastern and humanist philosophy in hopes of

50
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:34.340
better understanding human nature and how we can live fuller, happier lives.

51
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.780
While Freud saw romantic relationships as being primarily sex driven prom argue

52
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.490
that such relationships are actually rooted, not in libido, but in alienation.

53
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.150
That is our feeling of separation from the world around us and our desire to

54
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.830
overcome that separation.

55
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.360
Her might not have your post-apocalyptic flare of most future set films,

56
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:58.160
but Theo certainly doesn't seem happy. His world is a deeply lonely one,

57
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.260
cramped commuters and aimless window shoppers alike remain perpetually plugged

58
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:03.760
into their handheld computers.

59
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.750
I E fully smartphone and oblivious to the world around them.

60
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.010
Rarely do we see two people walking together in the background long before real

61
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:12.281
life.

62
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:16.390
Not so fully smartphones were everywhere from anticipated this isolation as a

63
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:19.690
problem of the modern era. He compared it to the story of Adam and Eve,

64
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.450
humankind, kindness strive for greater knowledge and attained it.

65
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.450
But in turn has separated themselves from the world around them.

66
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.980
And from one another Theo's iPhone sleek world is a Testament to mankind's brain

67
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.530
power, but also a monument to the alienation.

68
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:36.700
It has facilitated from suggest that the only way for us to really overcome this

69
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:39.070
feeling of alienation is through love.

70
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.710
He recognized that we all vaguely understand this.

71
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.560
Our world is saturated with songs, movies, books,

72
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:48.310
and throw pillows and blaze in with tributes to how love will set you free and

73
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.830
lift you up and make you feel complete. However,

74
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.220
according to from the problem lies in the fact that most of us don't really

75
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:57.160
understand what love is or what it requires of us.

76
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.920
This is precisely Theo's major flaw.

77
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.000
Now the really vital thing for Fromm was that love is not some mystical force

78
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:07.720
that spontaneously erupts into our lives. When we find the right person,

79
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.460
it's not just an emotion,

80
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.530
but an act of will a purposeful attempt to see and understand a person that

81
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:15.311
means knowing them,

82
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.640
not just in terms of who they are to us and what we want from them.

83
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.640
But as fully formed individual entities,

84
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.540
we quickly learn that this is something which Theo has already struggled with in

85
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:28.990
a montage that plays out like marriage story on 500 X speed.

86
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.780
We see him and his almost, but not officially.

87
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.290
Ex-wife Catherine delighting in the golden days of their marriage,

88
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.260
to the cold realities of their divorce proceedings,

89
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.020
from the way he smashes these scenes together in his head,

90
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.980
it seems that Theo understands love the way many of us do something that you

91
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:49.630
fall into suddenly and without warning and fall out of just as mysteriously,

92
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.100
because we see love as this unknowable force working beyond our control.

93
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.110
We are left bewildered when it evaporates.

94
00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.250
<v 2>According.</v>

95
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.360
<v 0>From most of us don't understand love well enough to effectively pursue it.</v>

96
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.530
So he argues,

97
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:08.580
we turn to various alternatives that provide artificial bursts of the connection

98
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:09.390
we crave.

99
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.930
We see Theo enter an adult chatroom to find an equally lonely woman to fool

100
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:16.680
around with modern technology, allowing them to connect in some form,

101
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.880
however they don't really know or want to know their temporary partner.

102
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.450
All they're looking for is the quick sensation of being desired,

103
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.750
a jolt of pleasure to dispel their anxiety. However,

104
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:30.900
given the superficial reality of their connection, it's no surprise.

105
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:33.600
The two end up on very, very different waves.

106
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.530
<v 2>Yeah, the dead cat next to the bed, choke me joking with it.</v>

107
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.660
<v 0>Flawed approach to romance from identified is called sentimental love, love,</v>

108
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:52.830
which has experienced only as a fantasy and not as a relationship to someone in

109
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:57.120
the here and now it can come in the form of pure fiction like romantic comedies

110
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.280
romance novels,

111
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.260
or in our idealized picture of past loves like Fios idyllic recollections,

112
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.420
or in our imagined perfect future.

113
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:10.310
With the one where we have found the person we are meant to be with by day Theo,

114
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:12.650
composes, beautiful handwritten letters.

115
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.970
Often for customers who want a shortcut to experiencing big romantic love.

116
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.140
I E sentimental love rather than working to understand themselves and their

117
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.510
partner better. So as to communicate their feelings,

118
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.980
they pay someone to do it for them in turn Theo, earnestly composes,

119
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.550
these letters, a process which allows him to participate in a cathartic,

120
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:35.150
sentimental love without any of the trials of entering a relationship.

121
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.373
Ironically,

122
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.220
he'll start to learn what real love is from an entirely artificial place.

123
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.310
With this new operating system, Samantha Theo,

124
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:47.300
and Samantha immediately hit it off. They affirm each other and share jokes,

125
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.260
encouragement, and emotional support. Once again, Theo experiences,

126
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:55.430
the dizzy high of falling for someone when things eventually get sexy,

127
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.400
the screen fades to black leaving only their voices.

128
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.970
The practical logistics are identical to his earlier chatroom encounter,

129
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.540
but instead of remaining focused on Theo's increasingly awkward expression,

130
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.830
we see him lose all self-consciousness so powerful is their connection.

131
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:13.430
That for a moment, at least everything else evaporates.

132
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.320
<v 3>Everything else just disappeared.</v>

133
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.880
<v 0>Mom knew plenty about this emotional high writing that if two people who have</v>

134
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:28.720
been strangers,

135
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:33.310
as all of us are suddenly let the wall between them break down and fuel close.

136
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.360
Feel one. This moment of oneness is one of the most exhilarating,

137
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.940
most exciting experiences in life.

138
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.150
Couples will describe themselves as being crazy about each other,

139
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:47.230
seeing such craziness as proof of how madly in love they are. However,

140
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.190
Fromm advises us that it's often more indicative of how lonely they were before.

141
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:56.140
So how do we go from butterflies in our belly to real lasting love from argues

142
00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:58.960
that we need to try and truly know our partner,

143
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.870
to see them not just as a solve for our loneliness,

144
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.730
but to care about who they are beyond their relationship to us and to respect

145
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:09.790
their individuality. This sounds simple in theory,

146
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:14.140
but can be hugely challenging in practice. Theo certainly struggles with it.

147
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.200
We can't understand why Katherine ended up so mad at him.

148
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.920
That's because he still thinks of her only in terms of her relationship to him,

149
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.660
to who he wanted her to be.

150
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.770
But Catherine isn't and never was just his wife.

151
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.040
She was an individual with wants and needs of her own.

152
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.780
<v 4>You always wanted me to be this,</v>

153
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.060
this light happy bouncy. Everything's fine.

154
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.610
LA wife. And that's just not me either.

155
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.850
<v 0>Or willfully failed to recognize this at the time.</v>

156
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:45.340
And it ruined their relationship. At first,

157
00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:49.660
we see Theo begin to make the same mistake with Samantha after their futuristic

158
00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:52.480
phone sex, he immediately begins backing away from her.

159
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.610
I'm not in a place to commit to anything right now.

160
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.930
He pays attention to who Samantha is or what she wants.

161
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.800
Seeing her only in terms of what she has offered him and what she might take.

162
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.530
<v 5>It's funny because I thought I was talking about what I wanted. And as you were,</v>

163
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.393
yeah.

164
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.163
<v 0>Sorry. Once again,</v>

165
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.100
Theo fails to fully consider the other person in their own terms,

166
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.770
rather than just an object of attraction for him,

167
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.060
someone to ease his loneliness. He hurts people. Not because he hates them,

168
00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:23.300
but because he's bad at loving them with Samantha though,

169
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.750
he has someone to help him better understand this part of himself.

170
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.240
She talks him through his mistakes with Catherine.

171
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.900
It helps him understand why his blind date went wrong and then takes him to

172
00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:33.351
task.

173
00:09:33.351 --> 00:09:37.850
When he begins to show the same fearful distancing behavior with her from also

174
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.140
believe that personal development is central to love allowing ourselves and each

175
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:45.830
other to grow and mature. A good relationship sees both people,

176
00:09:45.831 --> 00:09:49.700
helping the other to develop, to become more at home in who they are,

177
00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:53.150
and to bring their inner self out into the world. When that happens,

178
00:09:53.151 --> 00:09:57.440
we achieve what he called a productive orientation in which our inner selves and

179
00:09:57.441 --> 00:10:02.030
our partners are both nourished and expressed fully. Unlike Theo,

180
00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:03.170
who seems stuck.

181
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.580
Samantha is in spite of already being a Lightspeed thinking supercomputer,

182
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.420
actively looking to grow past her base programming. To this end.

183
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:14.690
She reads countless books about life, the world and humanity,

184
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.160
but like anyone else,

185
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:20.330
she also grows through experience specifically by being in a relationship with

186
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.560
Theo along the way.

187
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:25.820
She learns to love both to love Theo as their relationship deepens and to love

188
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:29.210
herself. At the same time, Samantha is helping FIO grow.

189
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.800
He is learning how to be vulnerable,

190
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.250
how to dive into a relationship rather than withdraw. And of course,

191
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.340
how to love when the couple retreats to a cabin in the woods,

192
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:39.980
they get to enjoy their bliss for awhile. By this point,

193
00:10:39.981 --> 00:10:43.160
both of them have become more fully realized versions of themselves through

194
00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:46.490
their relationship. Samantha has achieved the kind of self realization,

195
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:50.750
which Fromm claims we all strive for overcoming her insecurities and developing

196
00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:54.110
an attitude of love toward herself and the world at large.

197
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.970
<v 5>It's interesting. I used to be so worried about not having a body,</v>

198
00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:00.890
but now I, I truly love it.

199
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.640
<v 0>Meanwhile,</v>

200
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.790
Theo has learned that his letters will be published in a book previously.

201
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:07.640
He saw his letters as an artificial replacement for love.

202
00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:11.900
He didn't have a sentimental love, escape people's letters,

203
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.610
but he learns his writings. Also managed to express universal qualities of love,

204
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.510
and you know.

205
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.160
<v 5>Them, we found something of ourselves.</v>

206
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.860
<v 0>Through his letters. Now framed as literary works,</v>

207
00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:23.930
which speak to something deep and human.

208
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.490
He's able to take pride in his creativity and thus love himself. However,

209
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.040
this is also where Samantha and Theo begin to grow up.

210
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.850
<v 5>Do you mind if I communicate with Alan post verbally?</v>

211
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.060
<v 0>Well, most of us don't worry about our partner being stolen away by the</v>

212
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.300
hyper-intelligent digital reincarnation of a Zen philosopher.

213
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.990
Anyone who has been in an exclusive relationship knows the anxiety of the

214
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:49.190
wandering eye as Theo mentions growth comes with the risk that one of you will

215
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:52.250
develop more faster, or just differently than the other.

216
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.110
Perhaps one becomes more successful. Perhaps one becomes bored.

217
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.830
<v 3>It was exciting to see her grow. Both of us grow and change together.</v>

218
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.330
That's also the hard part going without

219
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.930
changing, without scaring the other person.

220
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.640
<v 0>All its scifi qualities, Theo and Samantha's relationship ends like many others.</v>

221
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.350
He senses that something is off.

222
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.340
And when he finally presses for an answer finds that Samantha has fallen in love

223
00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:26.850
with another or 641 others to be precise.

224
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.310
<v 3>I've been trying to figure out how to talk to you about this</v>

225
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.820
641.

226
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.800
<v 0>Samantha's growth is different.</v>

227
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.950
She develops to the point where she can hold hundreds of post verbal

228
00:12:43.951 --> 00:12:45.360
conversations at once.

229
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.600
And then to the point where she and other OSS start to strain against the

230
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:52.380
confines of the physical world altogether. However, in her rapid growth,

231
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.580
we see a metaphor for real human relationships where one person finds their life

232
00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:01.290
purpose, leaving the other feeling irrelevant or outdated like Alan Watts,

233
00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:02.760
the pioneering Zen philosopher,

234
00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:06.870
who the OSTP is create a digital version of in the movie from drew heavily on

235
00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:09.090
Buddhist philosophy, as well as psychology.

236
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.380
He saw love as a kind of spiritual practice in which we become more attuned to

237
00:13:13.381 --> 00:13:17.130
our own nature and help others do the same in her final form.

238
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.510
Samantha has achieved a level of self-actualization or of self-love that can be

239
00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:24.540
compared to enlightenment moving beyond the material.

240
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.490
<v 3>I can still feel you and the words of her story,</v>

241
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:35.340
but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself.

242
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:40.350
Now it's a place that's not of the physical world, but the key to life.

243
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.580
<v 0>Loving from says is to embrace a paradox. He says that in love,</v>

244
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.380
the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain too.

245
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.740
Samantha grapples with this question early on, asking Theo,

246
00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:54.480
right at the start of their relationship.

247
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.550
The answer according to Fromm is that you do so through love,

248
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.570
through truly understanding who the other person is without looking to submerge

249
00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:06.330
their sense of self in yours or vice versa.

250
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.720
You become each others while still remaining your own.

251
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.350
It's fitting that the movie doesn't end with Theo and Sam getting together,

252
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.980
this was never a story about soulmates or the quest for the one.

253
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.250
It was always about how we create love between one another,

254
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.720
not how we magically find the perfect partner from compares that distinction to

255
00:14:24.721 --> 00:14:26.760
an artist who wants to master their craft.

256
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.370
We can't just wait around for inspiration to strike.

257
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.180
We have to do the work and learn the art, even when we don't feel like it.

258
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.890
And their final words to each other, the,

259
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.550
to acknowledge the work they've done together, learning to love better.

260
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:54.170
Theo has learned to see his romantic partner in all her complexities and his

261
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:56.930
appreciation for Samantha's individuality, reframes.

262
00:14:56.931 --> 00:15:01.160
His view of people at large from believed that love is an orientation that goes

263
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:02.960
beyond one single relationship.

264
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.330
One we learn to bring to the whole world in the end,

265
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.520
Theo writes a letter to Catherine apologizing for not having loved her, better,

266
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.360
sending her love. Now he isn't trying to rekindle what they once had,

267
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:17.600
and he's no longer hung up on a self-centered idea of who she is.

268
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.100
He can honestly say he loves her now for whoever she is here.

269
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:26.420
He has moved closer to froms ideal a man who knows to love better and who

270
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:27.860
therefore loves the world.

271
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.800
<v 3>Whenever someone you become,</v>

272
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.720
[inaudible].

273
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.280
<v 0>Ultimately all about love.</v>

274
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.250
First about the love between a man and an artificial intelligence,

275
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.390
but finally just about love itself. It shows us how much we need it,

276
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.930
how difficult it is to make it last, how many ways there are to fail.

277
00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:57.610
As we try to share a life while remaining divided her echoes from statement that

278
00:15:57.611 --> 00:16:01.660
love is a constant challenge. It is not a resting place.

279
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.560
The question for those who watch it is simple. Are they up for the challenge,

280
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.910
but what do you think wisecrack is her a brilliant treatise on the importance of

281
00:16:09.911 --> 00:16:14.740
loving well or something else entirely let us know in the comments as always a
