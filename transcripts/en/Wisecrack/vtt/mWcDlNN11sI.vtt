6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.330
What else is there to do right now?

7
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.660
What's up wisecrack Jared, here today,

8
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:29.780
we're going to dive into the work of one very controversial filmmaker.

9
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.020
Paul Verhoeven for Hoban's films have divided critics,

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.590
some call him misogynistic kitschy, and statistic. Others.

11
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.500
Call him a brilliantly subversive satirist. So,

12
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.960
which is it to find out let's explore for Whovians,

13
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:46.310
most divisive films to see if his work is as deep as his champions claim or as

14
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:48.380
dumb as his detractors to cry.

15
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.460
Welcome to this wisecrack edition on Paul Verhoeven, deep or dung,

16
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.720
and as always spoilers ahead. But before we continue,

17
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:57.950
I want to give a shout out to this week.

18
00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:01.040

19
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:04.240
but if you're worried about losing your hair, you're not alone. In fact,

20
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.150
it's probably everyone's fear who could pull off a bald head like Dwayne Johnson

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.073
or VIN.

22
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.080
And the unfortunate part is that two out of every three guys will experience

23
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:15.080
some form of male pattern baldness. By the time they're 35,

24

33
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.990
And now back to the show for Homans had a controversial career from the get-go.

34
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.640
He began in the 1970s as a mainstream filmmaker in his native Holland making

35
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.930
provocative work that combined highbrow melodrama with Frank depictions of sex

36
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.190
and violence. However,

37
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:04.910
by the eighties for Hoban's films were condemned by his government for being too

38
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:09.080
violent, perverted and decadent, and for not having an explicit message,

39
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.730
unable to find financing.

40
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:14.000
The Dutch filmmaker took his talents to America where ironically,

41
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.550
he would face these exact same criticisms.

42
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.510
His American films generally fit into two camps, violence filled action,

43
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:23.930
spectacle, and sexually explicit dramas with Robocop,

44
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.750
total recall and Starship troopers for Hoeven injected,

45
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:31.370
a scifi sensibility into traditional action, film formulas, a revenge thriller,

46
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.840
a spy adventure, a war film. And of course it's all incredibly violent.

47
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.390
And when I say violent, I mean, this.

48
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.740
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

49
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.250
<v 0>For Hoven did the same with his dramas, but instead of explicit violence,</v>

50
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.020
there was explicit sex and nudity.

51
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.760
Just look at how much we had to sensor the Showgirls clip and the feedback not

52
00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:56.420
great.

53
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.640
One review of total recall called a dumber than WWF wrestling and innocent of

54
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:04.240
hypocrisy about it's cartoon violence. As for Starship troopers,

55
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.060
the Washington post said it was exactly like star Wars.

56
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.690
If you subtract a good story, sympathetic characters, intelligence, wits,

57
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.030
and moral purpose. And in Showgirls case,

58
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:16.450
the Austin Chronicle said it was so shabbily built that it must've been a

59
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.240
cynical desire to cash in on the Publix per Venus.

60
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.740
Now Verhoeven undeniably loves depicting excessive sex and violence,

61
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.580
but is that all there is to his work or are the critics missing something

62
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.270
as with most filmmakers understanding Verhoeven's intentions is helpful in

63
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.310
discipling his work. Ironically,

64
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:39.880
the man who was driven out of the Netherlands for being too extreme was shocked

65
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:43.510
by American culture to quote for Hoven, perhaps I was naive,

66
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.610
but when I arrived in America, I was amazed.

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.970
I was curious about the things that were shown on television and in cinemas and

68
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:50.770
having not been in the U S for that long,

69
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.670
I was able to distance myself and look at American culture in an ironic way,

70
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.440
perhaps in reaction to America's cultural access Verhoeven quickly embraced over

71
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:03.160
the top violence in his films. Take total recall on the surface,

72
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.140
the film appears to be just another big budget.

73
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:09.100
Arnold Schwartzenegger flick in which he offs countless goons and saves the day.

74
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.460
But for Hovan amps up the violence to ridiculous Heights.

75
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.630
When bullets hit people, they explode in grizzly bright red flourishes.

76
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.480
And it's not just the bad guys who die in glorious detail.

77
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.160
Innocent civilians are mowed down. Schwartzenegger even uses this one,

78
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:25.930
unlucky SAP as a meat shield,

79
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.260
the gunfire shredding his torso into pieces.

80
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.410
The brutality is so extreme that it becomes in and of itself.

81
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.190
The point transforming the film into subversive commentary on America's

82
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:39.810
fascination with why get ready for a surprise.

83
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.731
Indeed.

84
00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:45.750
The absurd violence only highlights how nonsensical your typical action film

85
00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:48.720
truly is a fact for Hogan himself acknowledged.

86
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.310
I have a feeling that making these kinds of idiotic things that his total recall

87
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.530
Robocop, Superman Spiderman, it's all completely nonsense in the film.

88
00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.370
Douglas Quaid,

89
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.060
an ordinary construction worker undergoes a memory implant that allows him to

90
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:06.210
live out his dreams of being a secret agent on Mars. However,

91
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:07.140
during the procedure,

92
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:11.130
something goes wrong and Quaids previously suppressed memories come flooding

93
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:11.580
back,

94
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.440
suggesting that he really is a secret agent or Izzy total recall constantly

95
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:20.460
pokes holes in its so-called reality. When Kuwait goes for his memory implant,

96
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.770
the total recall rep tells him that for two weeks,

97
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.290
you will get to live out his secret agent. Fantasies.

98
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.600
People are trying to kill you left and right,

99
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.740
you meet this beautiful exotic woman. Go on.

100
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.530
I don't want to spoil it for you, Doug,

101
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.190
but you rest assured by the time the trip is over, you get the girl,

102
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.100
kill the bad guys and save the entire planet.

103
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.360
And this is exactly what plays out in the film word for word Quaid meets an

104
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:48.540
exotic woman, kills all the baddies and saves the planet.

105
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.940
And it all happens in 10 weeks.

106
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.510
What's more when the technician implants Quaid with his memory package,

107
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:57.860
he remarks that's a new one blue sky on Martin married long.

108
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.280
And how does total recall end with blue skies on Mars,

109
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.690
obviously by constantly questioning the very reality of total recall Verhoeven

110
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.630
draws attention to the unreality of the violence on screen.

111
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.880
If none of this is actually happening,

112
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.610
then you can't take any of the violence on screen. Seriously.

113
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.750
The violence almost becomes a joke as of highlighting how silly the traditional

114
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.700
American action film truly is.

115
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.180
But this is only the tip of the Verhoeven subversive iceberg.

116
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.630
The filmmakers protagonists all fit the same basic mold,

117
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.010
seemingly moral and upstanding citizens who turn into instruments of violence at

118
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:34.550
the drop of a hat and Robocop Murphy starts out as a loving family.

119
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.960
<v 2>Well, my son, Jimmy watched this cop show, TJ laser,</v>

120
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:40.510
and this laser guy does this. Every time he takes texts out a fat guy.

121
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:43.240
So naturally my kid thinks that a good cop should be.

122
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.100
<v 0>Only to become a literal killing machine and Starship troopers,</v>

123
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:51.580
a bunch of [inaudible] teenagers become bug killing tools of the government.

124
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.960
And in total recall a seemingly normal average, Joe becomes well,

125
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.330
Arnold Schwartzenegger per Hoven.

126
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.990
There's a point to all of this after what went on in the second world war,

127
00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:05.860
and we saw what people were capable of doing to one another audiences simply

128
00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:08.200
wouldn't buy the idea of perfect heroes anymore.

129
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.560
People all over the world were forced to realize they were no better than the

130
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:14.530
Germans and were capable of committing similar acts.

131
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.820
Similarly Verhoeven's films show how easily normal people just like everyday

132
00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:22.300
Germans in world war II can be seduced to violence in Starship.

133
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:25.720
Troopers Rico rejects the advice of his father because you're going to Harvard

134
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:26.554
and that's the end of it.

135
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.130
He doesn't want to go to Harvard or take a vacation abroad to a peaceful planet.

136
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.390
Instead, Rico wants to join the Federation and kill a whole lot of bugs.

137
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.110
Similarly, in total recall Quaid longs to be more than just an average,

138
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.880
Joe stuck working a blue card.

139
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.710
<v 3>Oh, job. Don't you understand?</v>

140
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.010
I feel like it was meant for something more than this.

141
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.330
I wanted to do something with my life. I want to be somebody.

142
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.960
<v 0>What he really wants is to get into the thick of the action on Mars,</v>

143
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.120
a place of civil unrest and terrorism,

144
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.920
both Rico and Quade yearn for the excitement that only violence can provide the

145
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:04.240
exhilaration of killing alien scum on foreign soil or shooting up the batteries

146
00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:08.200
on a covert spy mission. All these characters need is a little push,

147
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.610
a propaganda pamphlet,

148
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.020
a memory implant to instantly become the killing machines of their dreams in an

149
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:16.120
interview promoting total recall for Hogan set,

150
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:19.690
the film actually depicts his greatest fear to quote for Hoven.

151
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.810
Total recall for me, had to do with fear of psychosis.

152
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.200
It had to do with the fear of basic fear of myself.

153
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.160
The psychosis is a way my brains could go. When people who behave nice,

154
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.330
suddenly turn out to be monsters and criminals and kill you by showing how

155
00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:38.080
quickly his characters can be drawn to brutality for Hoving comments on how we

156
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:42.850
as a society can also so easily be seduced by violence in the name of war

157
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.270
law and order, or even just because deep down we like it,

158
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.160
but that's not all Verhoeven.

159
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.970
Doesn't only use violence as a meta commentary on the absurd view of American

160
00:08:51.971 --> 00:08:54.190
cinema or as a critique of human nature,

161
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.700
to really understand his deepest intentions.

162
00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:00.720
We have to go all the way back to his childhood for Hoeven grew up in Nazi

163
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:05.640
occupied Holland, where he was exposed to unimaginable horror, bombings fires,

164
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.730
and mutilated bodies on the street to quote for Hoven.

165
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.350
I remember seeing dead people.

166
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.830
I remember when I was with my father being forced to walk past a group of Dutch

167
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.830
people who had been executed by the Germans in a reprisal,

168
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.310
but younger Hoban didn't realize the severity of what he was witnessing.

169
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.280
And instead detached himself from the violence later,

170
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:27.120
like in the experience to watching a movie and Rob van sheers biography on

171
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:27.750
Verhoeven,

172
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.130
the filmmaker recalls watching houses be blown up burning across the horizon.

173
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.390
He calls the experience less scary and more akin to watching a particularly

174
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:38.730
intense, special effect. Similarly,

175
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.000
each of her Hoban's characters detach themselves from the horrors happening

176
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:42.770
around them.

177
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.070
<v 4>And every day I have to make decisions that spend hundreds of people like you to</v>

178
00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:46.880
their deaths.

179
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.710
<v 0>We're hoping these films are filled with people.</v>

180
00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:51.080
Nonchalantly watching violence on screens.

181
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:55.040
Robocop constantly cuts the world news of oppressive governments and insurgency

182
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.370
only to cut to ads for a game about nuclear.

183
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.640
<v 4>Red alert, red alert, right in total.</v>

184
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:02.751
<v 0>Quaid watches,</v>

185
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:06.350
people being shot repeatedly on news while drinking his morning smoothie and

186
00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:07.131
Starship troopers.

187
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:11.120
The news cavalierly shows gruesome images from ongoing war hell they're even

188
00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:13.100
advertisements for live execution.

189
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.700
<v 4>Execution. Tonight at six, all net all channels.</v>

190
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.510
<v 0>These films to pick the world totally desensitized to violence just as</v>

191
00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:25.160
five-year-old for Hogan was numb to the carnage. He witnessed in a Metta twist.

192
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.960
Verhoeven uses this detachment to indict us because who is more desensitized to

193
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:32.780
violence than an American audience, munching, popcorn,

194
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.120
laughing and cheering in a darkened theater.

195
00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:38.750
As people are viciously killed on screen to quote for Hoven.

196
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.390
People love seeing violence and horrible things.

197
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.380
The human being is bad and he can't stand more than five minutes of happiness.

198
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.620
Put him in a dark theater and ask him to look at two hours of happiness and he'd

199
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:52.130
walk out or fall asleep. Just look at Starship troopers.

200
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.010
The film is framed as one long recruitment ad,

201
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.100
not for any of the characters in the movie, but for us, the viewer.

202
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.950
<v 4>Join the mobile infantry and save the world service guaranteed citizenship.</v>

203
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.230
<v 0>In the film we watch as a bunch of beautiful carefree teenagers become gung-ho</v>

204
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:13.160
soldiers. We cheer as Rico and Carmen shoot down a bunch of grotesque,

205
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.010
hideous bugs, save the day and still find love.

206
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.670
We're so busy applauding and laughing that we fail to notice that we're rooting

207
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:23.660
for the bad guys. The idea behind troopers, according to her Hoven,

208
00:11:23.661 --> 00:11:26.840
was to create a story that seduced the audience on one level,

209
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.770
but then make it clear to the audience. What they're admiring was actually evil.

210
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.550
The troopers in the film are actually part of a fascist empire committing

211
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:37.970
genocide against an intelligent alien race Perver Hoven.

212
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:39.590
We wanted to do a double story,

213
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.100
a really wonderful adventure story about these young boys and girls fighting.

214
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.520
But we also wanted to show that these people are really in their heart without

215
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:48.440
knowing it are on their way to fashion.

216
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.670
By getting us to root for pseudo Nazis for Hoban implicates the audience in the

217
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.210
characters crimes. We just like Rico,

218
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.020
Carmen and friends are so easily seduced by flashy images that we don't ever

219
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:01.780
stop to think about their context. We're just cute.

220
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.250
Innocent sheep brainwashed by the deranged images of fascist violence up on the

221
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:07.084
screen.

222
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.690
A similar sentiment is seen in Robocop where the news shows constant images of

223
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:15.160
chaos and disorder that lead the characters and us yearning for some unfettered

224
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.413
crotch shooting streets.

225
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:17.783
<v 5>Justice.</v>

226
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.670
<v 0>So Verhoeven is incredibly deep and the critics completely missed the point of</v>

227
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:26.820
his work case clubs. Right? Okay. We know,

228
00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:29.940
we know we still haven't addressed the elephant in the room, a movie.

229
00:12:29.941 --> 00:12:34.260
So reviled at one, the Razzie for worst picture, a movie so bad.

230
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.040
Even the people who like it tend to do so, ironically, yes.

231
00:12:38.041 --> 00:12:41.940
I can only be talking about the one, the only Showgirls.

232
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.580
Okay. But here's the thing.

233
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.360
Show girls actually isn't that far off from Verhoeven's previous films,

234
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.260
just as the director critiqued a violent action films and Showgirls,

235
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:56.160
the filmmaker goes even broader turning his sights on the entertainment industry

236
00:12:56.161 --> 00:13:00.390
as a whole Showgirls is the quintessential rags to riches Hollywood story,

237
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.020
a woman with nothing to her name works her way up to become a star.

238
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.670
This is the same story. Every Hollywood want to be dreams about move to LA,

239
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.020
make it big in the movies and become famous except in Showgirls for Hoban shows

240
00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:17.100
how rotten the stream truly is instead of centering his film around Hollywood

241
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.210
for Hoven transplants, this narrative to the glitzy artificial Las Vegas.

242
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.160
And instead of making it big in the movies,

243
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.150
Nomi works her way up from dancer to background show girl to star show girl.

244
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.730
But all that glitters is not a golden nipple.

245
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:33.840
Tassel Verhoeven makes sure that no me's ascent is anything but glamorous.

246
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.501
In fact,

247
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:37.800
there's hardly any difference between the low-level strip club where Nomi starts

248
00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:41.460
out and the flashy high-end Las Vegas showroom, where she ascends to stardom,

249
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.770
both places are driven by the same Craven,

250
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:47.640
commerce sex as Verhoeven puts it with Showgirls.

251
00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:49.350
The attack on Vegas for example,

252
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:53.580
was that everything is bottom line and that sexuality is only another thing you

253
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:55.320
can sell for the highest price.

254
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.880
Everything in Showgirls is a sexual transaction from the driver who picks Nomi

255
00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.860
up, expecting a little something in return.

256
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.000
You can sit a little bit closer if you want to the man who pays Nomi $500 for a

257
00:14:06.001 --> 00:14:10.110
lap dance to the boss who Nomi sleeps with an order to secure a role as her,

258
00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:11.610
our tribal crystal says.

259
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.970
<v 5>Darlin, no, I'm not. We all are. We take the cash.</v>

260
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.850
We cash the check. We show them what they want us.

261
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.480
<v 0>But Nomi constantly tries to fight this commodification,</v>

262
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.750
insisting that she won't sell her body. But by the end of the film,

263
00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:32.070
she realizes the truth that her dream job becoming the star of a Vegas show is

264
00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:35.010
yet another exploitation of sexual transaction.

265
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.110
<v 5>The face is going to be a bumpy porch.</v>

266
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.070
You're going to make a lot of money for the Stardust.

267
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.760
<v 0>Whether she's dancing at the strip club or posing on a giant billboard it's</v>

268
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:48.480
Nomi's body, that's making her money faced with such a realization,

269
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.570
Nomi spits and Zach's face and walks away the show as for the actual commerce of

270
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:54.830
the film for Hoven lampoons,

271
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:58.880
our cultural obsession with sex just as he did with violence by gratuitously

272
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.340
going over the top. So over the top,

273
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:04.760
in fact that we can't show you the scene where Nomi gyrates around to an

274
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:09.010
absurdly comical degree here, the sex, just like the Gore in total recall,

275
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.730
and Starship troopers becomes designed to incite laughter it too is a part of

276
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:17.210
the joke. And every aspect of Showgirls is in on this joke,

277
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.170
the films excessive over the top style is used to Lampoon the quintessential

278
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.000
golden age Hollywood musicals.

279
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.760
But while old Hollywood had lavishly choreographed,

280
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.620
classy song and dance numbers, Showgirls has lavishly choreographed buck naked,

281
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:34.000
gyrating that again, we can't show you what's more.

282
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.230
It mocks the competitive dog, eat dog nature,

283
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:39.380
ubiquitous and films about big Hollywood dreams. By again,

284
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.640
taking the genre to absurd extremes in a conversation between rivals,

285
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:48.320
Nomi and crystal. They bond over both enjoying dog food. Growing up literalized,

286
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.960
the two as dogs fighting over the same bone.

287
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.710
<v 1>I used to love doggy chow, doggy chat too.</v>

288
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.670
<v 0>Who is the ultimate target of this joke yet? Again, it's us.</v>

289
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.450
We are the audience at the cheetah lounge who can look but never touch.

290
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.860
We who pay money to see the same recycled Hollywood stories over and over again.

291
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.060
We who can't help,

292
00:16:10.061 --> 00:16:14.320
but vicariously get off on the wanton violence and sex depicted on screen.

293
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.030
When the lights dim, finally, we can indulge in our true debased selves.

294
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.140
So we're going to give her Hoban's work or at least this portion of his work,

295
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.260
a certified wisecrack deep with no reservations.

296
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.190
But what do you think wisecrack is for Hoven brilliantly roasting our gluttonous

297
00:16:30.191 --> 00:16:33.400
desire to consume outrageously graphic material,

298
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.820
or we try and way too hard to justify watching this.
