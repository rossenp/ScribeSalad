00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.370
<v 1>Why crack Greg here. And like many of you,</v>

2
00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:10.970
I would love nothing more than a breakdown, the newest film in the MCU,

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.130
but of course, due to the bad thing that might not be possible for a very long,

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.750
but perhaps a silver lining to this breaking content is the chance to catch our

5
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:23.360
breaths and consider the future of the MCU.

6
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.300
So we're going to do something different today. Don't worry.

7
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:29.210
We're not going to get into reckless speculation. Instead.

8
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:32.720
We're going to ask the question who should be Daniel's 2.0,

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.340
and how could our dream villain add the serious smarts to the MCU that we all

10
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:38.840
deeply crave? Well,

11
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:42.620
it turns out our topic was actually just cast an ant man,

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.180
three that's right. Kang the conqueror. So who is this snazzy dress,

13
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:51.410
bad guy, other than a potential new PVC pipe player and the blue man group.

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.150
And what is his unique multi temporal existence can raise some serious questions

15
00:00:56.151 --> 00:01:00.860
about our own human identity. We'll explain in this wise crack blog on Kang,

16
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:05.690
the conqueror and the future of the MCU. Oh, and spoil us for the MCU.

17
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.840
Lie ahead as well as potential spoilers for its future.

18
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:12.110
If we turn out to be profit now, before the breakdown,

19
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:15.590
I want to let you guys know where you can find some of the in-depth discussions

20
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:17.510
that go into making videos like this.

21
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.290
Our second channel wise cast has all of our live podcasts,

22
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:25.400
including show me the meaning culture binge and the squanch,

23
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.030
or show me the meaning. We talked about the Avengers and Spiderman,

24
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.520
and you can bet once a new Marvel film drops,

25
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.890
we're going to be doing an episode. So don't miss out,

27
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:42.050
dives into the movies and TV shows that you love. Now,

28
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.930
back to the show. Kang is one of Marvel comics,

29
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:46.850
most regularly appearing villains,

30
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.950
tangling time after time with the likes of the Avengers and fantastic four and

31
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:55.760
playing a role in a lot of the comics major developments over the years, uh,

32
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.740
time traveling desperate Kang Hills for one of the multi versus many earths or

33
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:02.810
utopia in the 31st century,

34
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.340
essentially he's like a cross temporal and extra dimensional Gangas con

35
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.420
constantly hopping around time and space in the quest for ever increasing

36
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:14.750
challenges to his martial arts skill and tactical prowess.

37
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.010
He can handpick the most powerful beings out of the time stream to final his

38
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:21.080
bath traveled back the weekend.

39
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:25.790
A society are even whole plans before they know he exists and he controls

40
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.880
vast armies of futuristically armed soldiers.

41
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.410
He's also a scientific genius and a man master strategist, man,

42
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.820
talk about overachiever,

43
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.590
but King is also radically different from most supervillains specifically

44
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.430
because he's not really defined by his conflict with the heroes he fights.

45
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.413
Instead.

46
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.980
He's more so defined by accomplishment as with themselves kangaroo born,

47
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:53.210
Nathaniel Rich's has adopted many distinct identities over his lifetime,

48
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.170
and this difference might be able to tell us a whole lot about what comes next

49
00:02:57.171 --> 00:02:58.160
for the MCU.

50
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.400
Mostly because Kings unique paths opens the door to exploring all kinds of

51
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:06.880
questions about identity. See King is less a person,

52
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.630
a more like a period of the thing is life and identity formed through the

53
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:14.890
experiences and fears he had during a specific portion of his personal timeline.

54
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.173
At other key points,

55
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.950
he creates entirely new entirely conflicting identities for himself

56
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.550
based on lived experiences and anticipations for the future,

57
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.810
like his future incarnation and Morton's guardian of time,

58
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:31.830
itself and wearer of stylish helmets or his teenage version.

59
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.450
I lad founder of the young Avengers and brazen intellectual property.

60
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.190
But the thing that separates these identities from mere costume changes is their

61
00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:44.460
prolific and very personal use of time travel. You know,

62
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:46.350
the common rule in time travel story.

63
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.660
<v 2>He must not see anybody or talk to anybody.</v>

64
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.300
And if you do could have serious repercussions on future events,

65
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.320
do you understand?

66
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.700
<v 1>Yeah, that one,</v>

67
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.560
neither cane mortars are iron lad cares one iota about this

68
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.281
all three,

69
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:03.750
go back and forth in their own timelines and various points to influence their

70
00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:06.690
past present or future. As a result,

71
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:11.400
these identities often come into direct literal conflict with each other

72
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.910
in turn influencing each of their respective developments.

73
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.410
Hell they often have a direct hand in the changes in the Daniel's perceptions

74
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.980
that leads to the creation of a new identity in the first place.

75
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.790
As you can imagine, this gets real confusing real quick.

76
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.840
You only need to look at the amount of rent cons Kings had in the comic is

77
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:31.620
proof.

78
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.970
This all makes Kang a pretty unique character who offers endless narrative

79
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:39.510
possibilities and raises lots of questions about identity.

80
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.290
And we think those questions can be best understood by looking at something

81
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.450
called narrative identity theory,

82
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.400
calling by philosopher Paul record the theory posits that identities

83
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.720
aren't locked in fixed,

84
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.730
but a form by an ongoing active process of narrative visitation that we

85
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:58.110
ourselves engage in.

86
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.090
I simply put our identities are the result of the stories we tell ourselves

87
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.010
about ourselves record pods is that we mold our memories into a cohesive

88
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:08.730
plot,

89
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.440
just like a screenwriter takes scenes as raw materials to form acts that make a

90
00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:16.020
story. We interpret the events of our past,

91
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.850
through our perceptions of the present,

92
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.470
which leads us to determine which past events are most relevant to who we feel

93
00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:26.940
we are. What's more, we also anticipate potential futures,

94
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.280
which inform our actions in the present.

95
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.960
That's creating new events for us to interpret and add to our story.

96
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.270
The futures we predict is most likely our desire most or are most scared

97
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:42.750
of provide endings to the story we are creating,

98
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.650
which in turn colors, our interpretation of the past,

99
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.670
like how it's much easier to pick out themes and motifs in a movie.

100
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:54.360
The second time you watch it with the ending and therefore the complete

101
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:56.520
narrative in mind in this way,

102
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.070
narrative integrates our reconstructed past our perceived

103
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:05.030
presence and our imagined futures into one perpetually shifting,

104
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.470
but cohesive story that we tell ourselves. And if the story changes,

105
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.880
if our interpretations of the past or expectations of the future are altered,

106
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.710
then we can integrate them into our stories. Thus altering our identities.

107
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.520
As convoluted as these stories can get Kang,

108
00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:25.750
the conqueror and Mortenson iron lad, the temporarily disparate identities,

109
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:30.010
that form that Daniel Richards are a great demonstration of narrative identity

110
00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:31.630
theory. Specifically,

111
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.490
these stories explore the interplay between our past present and future

112
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.690
King being the identity we follow most is the present. The more,

113
00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:45.520
this is the future and ironclad is the past and mortars observing all of the

114
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:46.570
past and future.

115
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.680
And the timeless dimension of limbo actively works against Kang,

116
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.090
his past identity,

117
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.190
but also manipulates our outright changes events to ensure that King always

118
00:06:57.191 --> 00:07:02.170
becomes the mortars. There will be no Marty McFly being here, sir, Kang,

119
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.891
meanwhile,

120
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:07.450
actively tries to prevent this potential future as a mortis at the same time,

121
00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:11.980
King also travels back in his own timeline to try and spur his teammate self,

122
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:14.500
to take up all the conquering, even earlier,

123
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.720
attempting to influence his past self,

124
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.180
just as a more than strives to influence him.

125
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.950
This leads his teenage self to rebel against this potential future forming a new

126
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:28.840
identity as iron lad, hanging out with the Avengers and trying to stop Kang.

127
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.730
Eventually he becomes a straight up superhero and forms the young Avengers as a

128
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:36.610
result in their multi temporal interactions,

129
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:41.320
which become crucial to the identity formation of each King and mortis.

130
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.400
An iron land can be seen as literal embodiments of records,

131
00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:49.840
ideas they're heightened forms of the interpretations perceptions and

132
00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:54.340
anticipations that we all make on a daily basis in our own lives made

133
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:58.510
possible through delicious time, travel, weirdness all together.

134
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.340
They form an overall narrative of their own showing how the same man can be a

135
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:08.290
superhero supervillain and in an indifferent guardian of time in a single

136
00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:13.240
lifetime narrative identity theory is interesting because it gives us agency

137
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:14.140
over our own.

138
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:19.090
Self-conception compare this to a more essential as views like Plato's,

139
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.110
which tie identity to a fixed mostly unchangeable nature.

140
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.500
In Plato's view, people could change to a degree,

141
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.600
but someone born to be a farmer was never going to be a King recurrence is far

142
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:35.470
from the only philosopher to ask questions about how people can change.

143
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.470
But it's theory can help us understand who we are,

144
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.300
how our identity is formed and how we can shift that identity to become the

145
00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:44.650
person we want to be.

146
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.720
So the complex interplay between King and Mortenson and iron lad mirrors,

147
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:53.860
the constant process, we engage with informing our own identities.

148
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.910
That's why we're so psyched to see him in the MCU.

149
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.980
And while we reckon he'll be the next big bed after all the next overarching

150
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:05.580
MCU Villa needs to fill an awfully big pair of boots,

151
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.400
Kings conflict with the mortars and iron lands,

152
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.250
desperate attempt to assert agency over his future,

153
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.210
provide a big dint character arc that makes them distinct from families,

154
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.710
but still matches the massive narrative stakes that the inevitable purple man

155
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:20.610
brought to the table.

156
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.173
<v 3>Inevitable.</v>

157
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.400
<v 1>More than just matching panels.</v>

158
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.330
We think Kang has the potential to address one of the biggest narrative issues.

159
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:31.730
The MCU faced in the affinity side,

160
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.070
the Matic cohesion based on where the MCU is post end game and what we know

161
00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:38.660
about upcoming projects,

162
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.580
it seems like the nature of identity could be an overarching theme in future MCU

163
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:45.290
films. What's more,

164
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.430
this theme could help make connections between various characters and across

165
00:09:49.431 --> 00:09:51.350
various worlds. In fact,

166
00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:55.310
we've even had a little taste of this with Spider-Man far from home,

167
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.660
which saw the web shooting high school heartthrob contemplating Tony Stark's

168
00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:02.780
legacy, immense pressure to shift his own identity that,

169
00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:06.260
that of the new iron man by introducing Kang as the new big,

170
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.210
bad Marvel has the opportunity to really tie the larger narrative of the MCU

171
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:14.840
together around themes of identity, how we form them,

172
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.130
how we adapt them to circumstances outside of our control and how we can

173
00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:22.340
reconcile our past with who we know we can become.

174
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.590
And if the MCU goes in this narrative direction can conserve as an antagonist

175
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:32.360
alongside the heroes, both camps confronted with the same thematic challenges,

176
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.690
but taken different paths in order to pull it off, though,

177
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.260
they'll have to really commit to developing all three identities.

178
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.610
That means building up King and mortars and iron land over a series of

179
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:48.140
appearances and having an ongoing macro plot centered around discovering the

180
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:51.410
full extent of King's cross temporal dickery.

181
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.180
And this complex identity has the potential to make Kang a much more interesting

182
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:59.240
and nuanced villain that animals don't get us wrong.

183
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.160
We love the big purple snap daddy and his themes of sacrifice and purpose drove

184
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:05.060
infinity war,

185
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:10.160
but a stronger Dematic unity within the wider story would be a huge step forward

186
00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:13.040
for the pioneering kind of interwoven narrative.

187
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.320
Marvel's been honing for the past 12 years and by exploring King's personal arc

188
00:11:18.321 --> 00:11:21.350
and interactions with his past and future identities,

189
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.480
Marvel can dig into internal narrative dilemmas as much as they do an external

190
00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:29.510
cosmic beefs, but Hey, maybe we're wrong.

191
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.230
And no one at the NCU brain trust has ever heard of Paul Ricker,

192
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.530
maybe Kang shows up in an man three and dies at the end,

193
00:11:36.531 --> 00:11:40.280
like so many MCU villains with squander potential before him,

194
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:45.290
even if that's the case, we're still psyched to finally see King in the MCU,

195
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.810
whatever direction Marvel decides to go in.

196
00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:52.070
We're confident in a live up to the legacy they've created thus far. Look,

197
00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:54.490
if we're super off the, with all this Kang stuff,

198
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.220
we're sorry for getting your hopes up, but rest assured,

199
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.810
if we're right about any of this, we'll repost this video until the end of time.
