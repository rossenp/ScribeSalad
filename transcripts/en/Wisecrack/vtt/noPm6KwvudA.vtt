00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.270
<v 1>Hey wisecrack, Jared here. If your bunker has reliable wifi,</v>

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.960
you may have noticed a certain word making the rounds lately and a growing

3
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.380
Corona.

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.150
<v 0>As far as crisis virus crisis to the COVID-19 crisis coronavirus crisis,</v>

5
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:19.790
the Corona virus crisis, the Corona crisis.

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.080
<v 1>COVID-19 is a crisis, but what exactly is a crisis,</v>

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.380
the meaning of the word seems obvious enough, but as we're about to find out,

8
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.450
there's actually a lot more to it than you might think.

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.020
Philosophers from Lao-Tzu to Voltaire have been grappling with the idea of

10
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:37.820
crisis for millennia. And now we're going to throw our mask in the ring. I mean,

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.220
not literally, I've lost my spare.

12
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.290
Welcome as wisecrack edition on the philosophy of crisis in everyday speech

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.820
crisis is sometimes lumped in with words like disaster, catastrophe, et cetera.

14
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.250
That is words that call to mind some big,

15
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.560
terrible event that causes a lot of damage.

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.830
But the technical definition of the term is much more specific.

17
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.430
The English word crisis has its root in the Greek word Canadian,

18
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.880
which means to separate four, choose ancient Greek positions.

19
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:08.330
Use the term to refer to a precise moment in the development of an illness.

20
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.820
When a doctor must apply a particular treatment,

21
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.010
according to the Hippocratic medical tradition,

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910
failing to act decisively during this brief window of opportunity could lead to

23
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.130
the death of the patient for Aristotle,

24
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:22.760
the root Canadian referred to a decision made in the political sphere.

25
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.510
That is a choice between contradictory options with the potential to create

26
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.190
lasting changes in society.

27
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.170
A crisis is a decisive moment in which there is the possibility for great harm

28
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.520
and great change.

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.320
And after which things can no longer be the same one historical crisis in

30
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:43.160
particular demonstrates how a devastating event can become the catalyst for

31
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:46.760
government overhaul, redistribution of power among institutions,

32
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.220
and even changes in religious thought.

33
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.480
I'm talking of course about the Lisbon earthquake of 1755.

34
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.860
Okay. So unless you're a history buff, you may not have heard of that one,

35
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.250
but this natural disaster and the way that individuals and institutions

36
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:05.300
responded to it contributed to major changes in the way that Europeans related

37
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:08.750
to their governments and had a big influence on some of the key thinkers behind

38
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:11.630
the scientific revolution on November. First of that year,

39
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.030
while many word church celebrating all saints day,

40
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.000
a massive earthquake struck the capital of Portugal,

41
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.000
the seismic activity leveled, many of the city's buildings,

42
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:24.680
crushing the people inside and as icing on the cake triggered a big old tsunami

43
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:28.550
that added to the destruction in the chaos that followed a massive fire,

44
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:33.290
broke out and burned away, much of what remained. It killed 60,000 people.

45
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:37.280
According to some estimates, the disaster sparked a crisis of authority,

46
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.850
specifically the authority of the church versus the authority of the state.

47
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.690
While the marquee of Palm ball defacto ruler of Portugal wanted Lisbon Knights

48
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:47.720
to focus on distributing food efficiently and rebuilding the city,

49
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.900
prominent Jesuit priest, Gabriel Malik,

50
00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:54.110
Greta urged people to spend their time repenting for the sins that he felt had

51
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:56.750
brought God's judgment upon the city. Thankfully,

52
00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:00.160
that kind of thing doesn't happen anymore. Us Senator called me and asked.

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.940
<v 2>Me if hurricane Katrina was judgment from God. I said, yes.</v>

54
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.250
<v 1>Crisis forced a choice between the authority of the church and that of the</v>

55
00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:13.950
state, specifically a new absolutest former,

56
00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:17.130
but the authority which would place ultimate decision-making power in the hands

57
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:20.970
of a sovereign at the center of a more secular government by ignoring the

58
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:24.930
church's plan for disaster response Pombal his actions would represent a huge

59
00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:28.230
departure from centuries of church involvement in state affairs,

60
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.230
as seen in the coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo, the third,

61
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.930
all the way back in 800 CE in the end,

62
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.160
Pombo made the choice for Lisbon by having Malik Greta publicly humiliated,

63
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.040
strangled to death, and his body burned at the stake.

64
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.420
Like all crises Lisbon was at a critical juncture in the Greek sense was the

65
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:52.440
city to respond to the disaster with thoughts and prayers or, you know,

66
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.540
by digging survivors out from the rebel.

67
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.520
But it also became a critical juncture in philosophy in the wider European

68
00:03:59.521 --> 00:03:59.910
world.

69
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.990
That catastrophe also led to a crisis of faith and philosophy that helped spawn

70
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:07.740
completely new ways of thinking about the world and its relation to the divine

71
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.430
before tectonic plates decided to treat Lisbon like an Etch-a-Sketch early

72
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:14.760
enlightenment intellectual spent a lot of time exploring theodicy.

73
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.750
The Odyssey is a branch of philosophy focused on reconciling the problem of evil

74
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.100
with the existence of a loving omnipotent God philosophers like Godfrey Leipnetz

75
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.920
argued that we live in the best of all possible worlds,

76
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.910
a universe in which evils like natural disaster and Wharf ultimately serve an

77
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:31.650
inherent good divine purpose,

78
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.280
which is beyond our mortal understanding for at least a few decades.

79
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.780
This very nice idea was reasonably persuasive to his fellow thinkers until

80
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:43.230
Lisbon in coming to grips with the disaster, French philosopher,

81
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:47.670
Voltaire Zoomer to live niches boomer came to believe that the idea of an

82
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:51.540
inherently good world was horrible against contemporary days.

83
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.400
Philosophers like John Jacques Rousseau,

84
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.000
who defended the notion of an essentially good universe ruled by some benevolent

85
00:04:57.001 --> 00:05:01.620
force. Voltaire argued that our cosmos is fundamentally a moral, neither good,

86
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.190
nor bad in the wake of the Lisbon earthquake Voltaire wrote and published

87
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.750
candied and entire effing novella whose primary purpose is to roast live knits

88
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.840
and his metaphysical optimism. The story follows candied,

89
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:16.710
a young man who learns like Neetsy and philosophy from one professor Pangloss

90
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.060
full Tara portrays Pangloss as a buffoon whose dedication to optimism leads him

91
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:25.380
to absurd divine justifications for minor trivia and major evils alike.

92
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.200
Voltaire has this live net standard and say for instance,

93
00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:31.530
that we all have noses because God was thoughtful enough to give us a place for

94
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.840
our spectacles and that it's ultimately all right,

95
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:36.390
that Columbus brought syphilis back from the new world because Hey,

96
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.020
at least Europe got chocolate out of it. And you thought your tweets were petty.

97
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.500
The crisis of Lisbon pushed European thought to its limits,

98
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.410
exposing the cracks in not only church authority,

99
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.490
but also the realm of philosophy in the decades. Following the crisis,

100
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:53.850
the philosophical community opted for a more secular paradigm.

101
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.100
Leaving questions about God, the theology,

102
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.200
and contributing to the of theological questions from philosophy at the same

103
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.280
time responsibility for understanding disasters shifted over to the emerging

104
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.260
field of science intellectuals.

105
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:10.850
Let off trying to figure out why bad things occur and started investigating how

106
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:12.290
they happen. Of course,

107
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.950
other crises perform similar roles in the aftermath of the Holocaust.

108
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.270
Philosophers were racked with basic questions of how did so-called civilization

109
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:21.710
birth. This monstrosity,

110
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.280
even the rise of fascism has been attributed to a series of crises,

111
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.100
which at critical junctures went the wrong way.

112
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.530
The arguments of thinkers like Italian philosopher,

113
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:34.960
Antonio Gramsci suggests that the conflicts exposed by long-term social change

114
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.740
enabled totalitarian movements to seek out even more or repressive means of

115
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:40.510
control. And for Carl Marx,

116
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:44.140
the whole theory that the world will move to communism is predicated on the idea

117
00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:48.250
that capitalism generates economic crises and people will respond to those

118
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:49.840
crises by mass revolt.

119
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.800
Now whether it's an earthquake and economic collapse or a destructive political

120
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:58.360
movement, the point is a crisis tugs at the very structure of our world.

121
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.670
It exposes the cracks and weaknesses.

122
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.120
Economic crises can point to shortcomings in economic infrastructure,

123
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.290
natural disasters bring to light rampant inequality ranging from unsafe housing

124
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:11.560
to food insecurity, like the torch happy Pombo.

125
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:15.700
We are also facing a crisis which will force some pretty big decisions over the

126
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:19.000
next few years COVID-19 and our response to it.

127
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.900
We'll be sure to highlight a store of problems embedded in society.

128
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.290
Take for instance, how different countries responded to the pandemic,

129
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.920
which revealed very strength or weakness of that different system of government.

130
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.950
While some have noted that China's authoritarian government was able to

131
00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:35.080
successfully STEM the spread of the virus.

132
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.590
The flip side is that the same government's lack of transparency allowed the

133
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:42.340
infection to spread and secrecy in its early stages. On the other hand,

134
00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:45.340
democracies have greater transparency as well as a free press.

135
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:49.120
That's able to share information and criticize or support official policy,

136
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.900
but those same democracies may be hesitant to enforce lockdown with heavy handed

137
00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:56.800
policing and stricter rules, but pushing the limits of the democratic process.

138
00:07:56.801 --> 00:07:59.380
Isn't the only problem this crisis is exposing.

139
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.130
It's also exposing issues in an area that may seem totally unrelated,

140
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.310
industrial meat production on the human front.

141
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.240
The fast paced production lines of the meat industry has workers laboring closer

142
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:11.350
to each other than ever.

143
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.910
And so it's no surprise that Tyson reported nearly 900 cases of COVID at one

144
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:19.090
plant alone, but to zoom out a little COVID exposures,

145
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:22.930
just how vulnerable we are to diseases that find a welcome breeding ground in

146
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:25.420
factory farms, evolutionary biologists,

147
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.360
Rob Wallace has pointed out that modern animal feedlots,

148
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.590
which pack thousands of animals together in close quarters are the little bears

149
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:34.780
bed to the flu viruses, Goldilocks,

150
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.160
a cozy biological stew in which to fester and mutate both the

151
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:43.570
2009 H one N one virus and the 1918 Spanish flu. Yeah,

152
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.840
that flu have been traced back to American feedlots.

153
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.600
Now we're not trying to take away anyone's hamburgers.

154
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:51.310
And if anyone tries to take ours,

155
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.400
we've collectively sworn to cut it still with the U S meat dwindling as factory

156
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:59.250
farms and processing plants fall to COVID outbreaks.

157
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.030
It might be worth exploring whether we absolutely have to get our stake import

158
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.030
chops by cramming thousands of animals together in monotonous,

159
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:09.570
unsanitary conditions for the duration of their short lives or whether there

160
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:10.860
might be a better way.

161
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.730
Another weakness that COVID and similar diseases expose is how structural

162
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:19.050
inequalities of all kinds can help create pockets of highly vulnerable people

163
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.170
within the broader population of a city nation, et cetera,

164
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.320
with diminished access, to testing and treatment, these groups,

165
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.450
indoor disproportionate pain and debt,

166
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.350
and can become the unwilling vectors for the spread of disease to other parts of

167
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.184
the population.

168
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.840
The virus has thrown these effects into sharp relief and in the process brought

169
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:40.350
up questions about how we ought to structure our economies, governments,

170
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.460
and societies,

171
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.200
and who ought to control them and how everybody has something to say about

172
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:48.330
everyone. Else's response to the pandemic,

173
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.550
whether they're shaking a fist at Florida beach goers,

174
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.540
or seriously considering the upside of centralized despotism people everywhere

175
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:57.000
are thinking hard about where power belongs,

176
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.840

177
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:04.980
months ago are already up and running $2 trillion stimulus package,

178
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:09.630
anyone check place while no one knows for sure what our world will look like on

179
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:11.520
the other side of this particular crisis.

180
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.570
One thing is certain things will never be quite the same,

181
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.490
but what do you think wisecrack?

182
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.150

183
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:24.090
crisis? What might change over the next few years?
