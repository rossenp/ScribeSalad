00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.040
<v 0>This video is brought to you by Skillshare.</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.640
<v 1>What's up guys, Jared, here to talk about the movie that made the Oscars.</v>

3
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:14.870
Cool again, that's right. Parasite a film. So mind-blowingly awesome.

4
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:17.210
It would leave even the most, her boasts cinema enthusiasts,

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.490
completely speechless at this point,

6
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:23.270
repeating praise for parasite and it's director bong Joon ho is kind of like

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.180
vaping. Everyone's doing it and it's kind of a waste of breath.

8
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.970
So we'll save any further gushing for our diary.

9
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.060
Parasite was celebrated all over the world for its nuance,

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.460
take on wealth inequality, but bonds, June hosts,

11
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:38.450
scathing critique of modern society goes way beyond its riveting plot points,

12
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.291
which is why today.

13
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:42.470
We won't be delving into the narrative or the meaning of the title or the

14
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:45.200
meaning of that. Scholar's rock though, if you want to hear more on that,

15
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:48.110
be sure to check out the parasite episode of our movie podcast,

16
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:49.730
show me the meaning. Instead,

17
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.270
we're going to focus on some of the visual details of the film of which even the

18
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:56.240
smallest elements augment and enhance parasites,

19
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.060
overarching critique fittingly for a film about money.

20
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:03.470
All of the material things we see on screen from the pizza boxes to the windows

21
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.840
serve an important symbolic purpose.

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.650
Let's find out how in this wisecrack addition on parasite, and of course,

23
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.790
spoilers ahead for an Oscar winning best picture that we actually shockingly

24
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.800
agree with. But before we get into it,

25
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:18.110
I want to give a shout out to Skillshare after work.

26
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.140
I love to sit down and watch a movie or play some video games,

27
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:22.160
but every once in a while,

28
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.130
I get into this creative groove where I just want to put some work into

29
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:26.600
developing a new project,

30
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.440
enter Skillshare and online learning community with hundreds of classes on

31
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.080
business design, productivity, freelancing,

32
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:36.920
and so much more in the past I've recommended classes like Susan Orleans,

33
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.530
creative nonfiction, right truth with style,

34
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.260
which definitely helps people who want to organize their writing.

35
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.740
But I've recently been watching classes that focus a bit more on physical

36
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:47.570
production in iPhone filmmaking.

37
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:51.230
I learned about iPhone videography and all the surprising advantages of using

38
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:54.860
your mobile device to tell a compelling story for just $10 a month.

39
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.760
You can have access to classes like this that will get your creative juices

40
00:01:58.761 --> 00:01:59.720
flowing. It's great.

So start learning and join Skillshare today. And now back to the show,

46
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.300
our guys let's do a quick recap parasite centers around the cunning destitute,

47
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.140
Kim family, who dream of escaping their lousy semi basement apartment.

48
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.040
They scam their way into the lives of the very wealthy park family using

49
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:29.750
increasingly devious methods to find work as their tutor, art therapist, driver,

50
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:34.370
and housekeeper things are looking up until they discover they're not the only

51
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:35.960
family leeching off the parks.

52
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.080
The former housekeepers husband has been camping out in the house's hidden

53
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:43.010
bunker for years to hide from debt collectors tensions between the two working

54
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:47.060
class families Mount and everything crescendos at a very bloody birthday party

55
00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:49.880
that leaves several dead after stabbing Mr. Park,

56
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.930
Mr. Kim retreats into the bunker to hide for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile,

57
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:58.220
the Kim's son fantasizes about earning enough money to buy the house and free

58
00:02:58.221 --> 00:02:59.050
his dad.

59
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.820
That's the bleak weekend appropriately enough for a story revolving around a

60
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.360
hidden basement. Bunker architecture really matters in the film,

61
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.140
the grungy reality of the Kim semi basement apartment contrasts with the

62
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.610
opulence of the parks glamorous home to effectively create two different worlds.

63
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.090
A lot of attention has been paid to the architecture of the houses in part

64
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.960
because the entire movie was filmed on sets built specifically to fit bongs

65
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.640
vision upon closer inspection,

66
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.150
you'll find that every choice made in creating these sets was carefully

67
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.984
calculated.

68
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.740
The Kim's home is based on real semi basement apartments that were built across

69
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.610
sold during the cold war to provide shelter. In case of a North Korean attack,

70
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.941
though,

71
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.570
renting out semi basements was banned for years due to these squalid living

72
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:41.200
conditions,

73
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.890
South Korea's economic boom led to such overcrowding that the government

74
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.220
relented, we see the poultry living conditions of the camps.

75
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.610
They reside in a dirty concrete building, surrounded by. Stinkbug.

76
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.513
<v 2>Not a well,</v>

77
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.583
it's a good thing.

78
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.580
<v 1>To literalize the fact that they are at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.</v>

79
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.510
They live below ground and must walk down a set of stairs to get to their front

80
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.860
door. At the same time.

81
00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:11.160
Everything in the house suggests a solidarity among these family members,

82
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.790
their socks hang from the same hanger and underwear covers the walls of the

83
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:16.290
bathroom. In contrast,

84
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:19.920
the Park's house feels definitively not specific to South Korea.

85
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.700
Rather it mimics the modernist style that was originated by Western architects

86
00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:26.550
like Richard Neutra, Louis Kahn, and Frank Lloyd Wright.

87
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.180
The ultimate realization of the modern aesthetic was the glass house and the

88
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.410
Park's home is nearly just that fishbowl like and how much it can reveal.

89
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.400
It also features other modernist touchpoints like a flat rooftop and open floor

90
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:41.760
plan and an overall minimalist aesthetic. According to art curator,

91
00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:42.630
Donald Albrecht,

92
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:46.500
modernist architecture as seen in cinema has developed a cluster of connotations

93
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:47.334
of affluence,

94
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.840
glamor and escape houses that embody that aesthetic of bound in major cities all

95
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:55.800
over the world from Tokyo to Oslo in a form that credit Kate Wagner has dubbed

96
00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:59.430
the MC modern because of their tendency to each contain the exact same

97
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.370
hodgepodge of modernist design aesthetics. That is,

98
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:05.640
they all seem to be inspired by the [inaudible] school of architecture

99
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.571
sociologist.

100
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:10.680
Sunki chai agrees that the home indicates a sort of nouveau Rishi aesthetic and

101
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:13.260
establishes the parks as not just the 1%,

102
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.670
but the highest level of the 1% the parks as among a select elite who have

103
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.250
managed to succeed in a ruthless capitalist world.

104
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.480
Also fittingly must walk up multiple staircases to access their home.

105
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.510
It's also worth noting that modernist architecture has some pretty deep

106
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:30.930
cinematic roots. Most playfully identified by designer and writer,

107
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.760
Benjamin Chritton and his books,

108
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.050
evil people in modernist homes and popular films and sad people in modernist

109
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:41.370
homes and popular films as curtains titles indicate films will frequently depict

110
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:44.760
modernist homes as the layer of a villain like in blade runner or the big

111
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.800
Lebowski, or even the Incredibles too,

112
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.160
or as a metaphor for the emotionally empty lives of its residents.

113
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.290
As in a single man or the ice storm.

114
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.280
This makes it a fitting home for the park family who though not exactly the

115
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:57.050
antagonist,

116
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.220
nonetheless emerged as the central subject of bongs class critique their part

117
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.250
villain and their obliviousness to the suffering of those less fortunate.

118
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.810
And they're part tragic figures,

119
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.200
but the mother apparently suffering from substance abuse and the young son

120
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.430
harboring some trauma,

121
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.520
all in all the perfect residents for this modernist Mecca.

122
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.180
We could spend forever talking about the architectural choices in this film.

123
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.460
Take, for example, each house's main window,

124
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.200
the Kim's is short with a severe frame facing offense that gives it a cage like

125
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:24.770
field.

126
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.520
Part of our view out of the window is obscured by a hanging rack of plain socks

127
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.570
as if to accentuate the fact that in such a cramped space,

128
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.050
every bit wall or ceiling must serve multiple purposes.

129
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.670
What we do see is a garbage filled alleyway where drunken revelers often relieve

130
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:43.180
themselves. The window is rarely illuminated according to bong,

131
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.080
most semi basement apartments only get about 15 to 30 minutes of natural

132
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:48.070
sunlight a day.

133
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.940
The film opens with the Kim sun key Wu slouching on an uncomfortable looking

134
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:52.390
couch,

135
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.710
soaking up a few of these precious rays while struggling to steal wifi access,

136
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.980
not the stuff capitalist dreams are made. In contrast,

137
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:02.980
we have the jaw dropping floor to ceiling window,

138
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.630
which was designed with a 2.35 to one aspect ratio like a movie theater screen.

139
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.700
It looks out sands any obstruction at an Eden S garden that overflows with

140
00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:13.390
sunlight.

141
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.470
The thought out interior design includes a plush couch to lounge in while gazing

142
00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:20.680
out the window and generally feeling pretty awesome about your life.

143
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.530
That brings us to another seat central difference between the two houses,

144
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.940
the issue of space,

145
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.150
every surface of the Kim's home is cluttered with odds and ends.

146
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.490
Cleaning sprays sits next to a pair of shoes.

147
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.270
Boxes are piled floor to ceiling and the hallway doubles as a closet.

148
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.250
Some proportions of the home seem almost comically conceived like the elevated

149
00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:41.050
toilet, which production designer, Lehigh,

150
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.460
June designed to be as close to the ceiling as possible as if to emphasize the

151
00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:47.980
constant discomfort for the Kim's experience.

152
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.270
The family is frequently crammed together in close proximity as if to emphasize

153
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.990
both the uncomfortable claustrophobia of their conditions and their deep

154
00:07:55.991 --> 00:08:00.190
connectedness. In contrast, the parks home seems to have never known clutter.

155
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.180
The only things we see are strategically intended for display from the wine

156
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:05.260
fridge to the family,

157
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.800
glamor shot to the sprawling glass cases of pricey dishware,

158
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.820
the small touches of disorder that crop up from time to time like the young park

159
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.230
boys toy arrows are quickly compensated from view by a keen eyed housekeeper

160
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.330
fittingly and Contra the Kims.

161
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.290
The parks are rarely seen in the same room together almost as if the excess of

162
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:25.510
space has compartmentalized each member.

163
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.880
And unlike the basic layout of the Kim's apartment,

164
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.780
the sprawling design of the park home is rife with hiding spots that make for

165
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.530
easy eavesdropping and glass walls that make for well,

166
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.010
I dropping this suggests that though their house might be welded protected from

167
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:43.330
the outside world with its fancy video security. Once they craft the family,

168
00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:44.920
like the Kim's make it inside,

169
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.610
the parks are left relatively fence list against their manipulations,

170
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.210
just as architecture helps tell bong story of wealth inequality.

171
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.790
So to do the choices he makes about representing food is an issue

172
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:58.380
indistinguishable from class,

173
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:01.950
particularly in a country that has experienced severe food price inflation in

174
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:03.840
recent years on a basic level,

175
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.050
food serves as an important indicator of wealth and parasite.

176
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.120
At the beginning of the film,

177
00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:12.500
we see the Kim's folding pizza boxes for pizza generation doing low paid labor

178
00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:15.920
for a restaurant that seems to encompass the glow [inaudible] that's made life

179
00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:17.600
in South Korea. So competitive.

180
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.990
It seemed that they can't even afford to eat the pizza. Indeed,

181
00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:24.890
the screenplay notes, the sad empty fridge and Korean food journalist,

182
00:09:24.891 --> 00:09:28.910
Joe McPhearson points out that we see the family early on subsisting on moldy

183
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:31.700
white bread, cheap chips and F light,

184
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.210
which according to MacPherson is the cheapest milk beverage on the market.

185
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.010
Once the Kim's start working for them,

186
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.100
they gained some disposable income and their rise in class.

187
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.610
This is illustrated by the gradual improvement of their diets. First,

188
00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:45.530
we see them eating at a drivers cafeteria,

189
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.830
which China notes are known for cheap filling buffets that work in class

190
00:09:48.831 --> 00:09:50.480
chauffeurs could enjoy. From there.

191
00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:53.330
We see them kicking back and dining out at pizza generation,

192
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.780
being served by the same employee who previously dock their pay.

193
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.630
They've written from lowly workers to customers.

194
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.550
Eventually they're able to afford beef,

195
00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:04.730
which they cook at home in an LA Golby style. By this point,

196
00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:08.750
three of the family members have progressed to Sapporo beer and expensive import

197
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:10.880
from Japan, their food journey culminates.

198
00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:13.850
When the parks go on vacation and the Kim's get to play pretend. Yeah,

199
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.820
they're fancy house. They enjoy bottled water from the fridge,

200
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.240
as well as a wide array of classy foods like shellfish, oysters,

201
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.720
and an even wider array of alcohol. Most amusingly key junk,

202
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.560
accidentally nauseous on the parks dog treats confusing them for human food

203
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:28.371
underscoring.

204
00:10:28.371 --> 00:10:32.420
The fact that the parks pets likely eat better than the Kim's do the parks.

205
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.090
Now Sean colorful plates of intricately arranged fruit,

206
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.400
a particularly expensive commodity in South Korea in contrast that Kim's piled

207
00:10:39.401 --> 00:10:42.710
their plates with rice and vegetables at the buffet for the parks.

208
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.230
Food is a matter of enjoyment for the Kim's.

209
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.400
It's a matter of survival while the Kim's carefully rationed every piece of

210
00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:50.450
bread in their pantry,

211
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.890
the park boy can tear into leftover birthday cake without a second thought at

212
00:10:54.891 --> 00:10:55.401
other points,

213
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:59.060
food embodies the dichotomy between classes that fuels the film's drama.

214
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.680
Most notably. This happens when Mrs. Park instructs, Mrs. Kim, to cook Ramadan,

215
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.420
a name made up by the films,

216
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.560
English translator to describe a Korean dish that mixes elements of ramen and

217
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:14.150
UConn Mrs. Park emphasizes that Ramadan should be topped with expensive sirloin

218
00:11:14.151 --> 00:11:17.960
steak and confirms that it's been cooked through before she indulges in an

219
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:20.960
interview. Bong noted that this choice was very intentional.

220
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.660
This dish is typically seen as a meal for poor folks,

221
00:11:23.661 --> 00:11:27.470
but it happens to be the park boy's favorite dish bawling explains that while

222
00:11:27.471 --> 00:11:30.500
children might not understand the class connotations of food,

223
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.720
the rich wife would still be uncomfortable,

224
00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:34.400
feeding him cheap noodles for dinner.

225
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.030
So she added the Ritz sear sirloin as a topping appropriately.

226
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.860
This means that the pricey sirloin steak sits on a bed of common noodles as if

227
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.640
literally using the message of the film like steak over a bowl of noodles.

228
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.970
The film shows multiple images of wealthy folks, metaphorically,

229
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:52.490
and literally on top of poor folks,

230
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.840
but there's layer to the interplay of food and class,

231
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.860
mainly because food has played a central and devastating role in the Kim

232
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:03.580
family's economic history. At one point, the Kims referenced a chicken shop.

233
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:07.360
They owned that went bust as well as an unsuccessful Taiwanese cake. Shop.

234
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.723
<v 3>Chicken.</v>

235
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.180
<v 1>As journalists S Nathan Park notes.</v>

236
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.130
The number of fried chicken joints in South Korea tripled between 2003 and 2013.

237
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.640
And then more than doubled again from 2013 to 2019,

238
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.450
part of this was response to the 1997 Asian financial crisis,

239
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.290
which left many middle-class Koreans without work and forced them to become

240
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:35.190
self-employed low interest rates made it easy to take out a loan and thousands

241
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.060
took the gamble on opening a mom and pop fried chicken shop of which many like

242
00:12:39.061 --> 00:12:40.920
the Kim's would inevitably fail.

243
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.970
Then the family opened a Taiwanese cake shop attempting to capitalize on a fad

244
00:12:44.971 --> 00:12:47.010
that swept Korea in 2016,

245
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.010
this turned out to be an even more precarious business.

246
00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:52.230
And when the bubble burst thousands of shop owners,

247
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:54.150
like the Kim's were left bankrupt,

248
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.620
or like the housekeeper and her husband were left deeply in debt in this way,

249
00:12:58.621 --> 00:13:00.330
the references to the family's history,

250
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:03.690
according to park of a whole world of middle-class failure,

251
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.170
reflecting economic hopes and tragedies that still resonate throughout the

252
00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:10.590
country. It shows us that the Kims weren't always living in poverty.

253
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.750
They were once middle-class business owners,

254
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.680
it was their inability to turn food into a livelihood that ultimately crippled

255
00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:17.190
them.

256
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.610
There's one other aspect of the production design that feels too important,

257
00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:24.810
not to name specifically the array of native American theme toys that the parks

258
00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:28.110
on constantly plays with ranging from a teepee to a head dress,

259
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:31.800
to a bow and arrow here. We see the boy enjoying American commodities.

260
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.380
The mother even brags that the teepee comes from America,

261
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.350
which chais says probably makes her feel cosmopolitan.

262
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.493
<v 3>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

263
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.520
<v 1>Try notes that in South Korea,</v>

264
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.210
there's still a sense that certain things from America are high class,

265
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.830
particularly education aptly Mrs. Park perks up immediately upon hearing that a

266
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:56.810
potential tutor has been educated at Illinois state university. Well.

267
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.880
<v 3>[Inaudible], [inaudible].</v>

268
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.451
<v 1>The same time.</v>

269
00:14:06.451 --> 00:14:09.990
It's interesting that the boy is imitating native American culture rather than

270
00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:13.080
playing say American cops and robbers here.

271
00:14:13.081 --> 00:14:15.180
We think balling is being a bit sly.

272
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.080
The park boy is unknowingly taking on the fashions and cultural objects of a

273
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:23.520
historically brutally mistreated demographic of Americans for his own amusement.

274
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.300
This only bolsters our sense that the parks exist in a blissful bubble of

275
00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:29.010
privilege. As bong puts it.

276
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.130
The actual history of native Americans is very complicated,

277
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.040
but the mother and the boy don't care about the complexity at all.

278
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.680
It's just a decoration for them. At one point,

279
00:14:37.681 --> 00:14:39.510
the boy sleeps outside in his teepee,

280
00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:43.500
in the rain as if role-playing a less fortunate life than the one he leads

281
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.680
brilliantly and uncomfortably at the exact same moment,

282
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.750
the parks lie on the couch sexually.

283
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.460
Role-playing a scenario in which Mrs. Park selling sex for drugs.

284
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.570
The two simultaneous narratives evoke the family's obliviousness to and

285
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:59.270
disregard for the realities of living in poverty,

286
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.570
safe and secure in their wealth. Pretending to be poor turns,

287
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:05.990
a grim brutal way of life into a fun daring game.

288
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.030
<v 4>Hitting me up, hitting me. Tony will come better.</v>

289
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.450
<v 1>Parasite creates a modern capitalist fable that warns of the immorality and dark</v>

290
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.420
implications of income inequality, and within the film,

291
00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:24.100
every set prop or slice of pizza contributes a little bit to that message.

292
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.720
But what do you guys think is bong Joon ho a freaking genius is parasite a fun

293
00:15:28.721 --> 00:15:32.890
family, thriller or a subtle invitation to set fire to the system.
