<v 1>Fast. He may tease maroon, see dog Jared, here to</v>

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.150
talk about a 2019 films.

4
00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:16.970
So unpredictable that the phrase jaw dropping feels like an absurd

5
00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:18.920
understatement. The lighthouse,

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.360
whenever a movie leaves me feeling that weird cocktail of impressed all and

7
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.310
confusion I have to wonder,

8
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.990
is this film too smart or is it just pretending to be let's investigate in this

9
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:33.950
wisecrack condition on the lighthouse, deep or dumb, and of course,

10
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.950
spoilers ahead. But before we get into it,

11
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:40.610
I want to give a shout out to keeps a lot of, you know, how much I like my hair.

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.180
It's part of my identity. So I'm scared out of my mind about losing it.

13
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:46.910
And from what I've learned, prevention is the key.

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.150
If you've noticed your hair thinning and want to keep yourself from going bald,

15

but staying out of the sun or throwing away all your hats won't solve the

17
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:59.300
problem because genetics are the main cause of male pattern.

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.230

26
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.670
guys, let's do a quick recap. Lighthouse spotlights, no pun intended.

27
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.450
The relationship between seasoned lighthouse keeper old played by Willem Defoe

28
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.660
and his reluctant mentee young played by that vampire guy.

29
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:42.590
Who's arguably the best young actor of the moment. Anyway, old is gassy

30
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.050
and gas lady potentially screwing with young, for his own amusement,

31
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.820
putting him through punishing physical labor,

32
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:51.680
and constantly trying to get him wasted.

33
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.650
<v 0>To leave and toast unfinished, right?</v>

34
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.880
<v 1>While also refusing to let young look at his precious lantern the day before</v>

35
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.090
they're supposed to finally leave. Everything goes buck wild,

36
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.870
young kills the out of a seagull causing a gnarly storm to brew.

37
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.850
And then it's like, man, do I need a drink?

38
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.200
The men bond open up about their past and even sing fun sailor songs.

39
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.850
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

40
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.510
<v 1>When the ferry fails to pick them up things to generate fast young,</v>

41
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:23.540
who we've learned, killed his former boss and assumed his identity.

42
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.740
<v 0>I just stood there. It was all just, just stood.</v>

43
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.340
Watched him get swallowed by them. Logs.

44
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.840
<v 1>Loses all this and beats up old, eventually killing him,</v>

45
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.750
but not before pausing to hallucinate him as his dead boss,

46
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.560
a mermaid and a squid creature. Then young finally gets to see the light,

47
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.810
which is a beautiful serene experience.

48
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.040
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

49
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.660
<v 1>Kidding. It just about kills him.</v>

50
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:52.940
And we end on an unutilized friendly shot at him,

51
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.250
lying naked on a Rockwell birds Peck at his innards,

52
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.280
which we have thoughtfully concealed with Nick cage gifts. Okay.

53
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:01.750
So what the name of Poseidon just went down the way we see it.

54
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.630
There are countless possible ways to glean meaning from this film.

55
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.180
So we're going to focus on three aesthetics,

56
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.020
psychosexual dynamics and mythology. Let's start with aesthetics.

57
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.730
According to the film cinematographer,

58
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.050
Jaron [inaudible] Edgar said that atmosphere comes first and then the rest comes

59
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.590
out of that. And boy, this film's got atmosphere for days.

60
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.970
It feels out of a different non-specific time with an old fashioned boxy,

61
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:29.500
one point 19 to one aspect ratio that visually smushes the two men together and

62
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.570
makes us increasingly claustrophobic.

63
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.210
They also mimic the look of ortho chromatic film,

64
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.690
which dates back to the early days of photography and was particularly used for

65
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.770
portraits fittingly.

66
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.040
The first frontal view of young and old is presented almost as if they're posing

67
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:45.730
for an old fashioned portrait. As they gaze at the camera unnaturally,

68
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.520
still ortho chromatic, film filters out red light,

69
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.520
giving the sky a washed out look and people's faces a darker,

70
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.790
more textured complexion. It's evocative and surreal.

71
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.720
It makes the actors look weathered as hell because they were using old lenses

72
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.040
and an old style of film.

73
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.160
Everything about the production process had to be super meticulous.

74
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.540
The ortho chromatic look requires a ton of light in the film set was so bright

75
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.751
to that.

76
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:12.280
Apparently some film crew members wore sunglasses even during nighttime scenes,

77
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.040
which is honestly just called style.

78
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.460
There's some intimation throughout that light is dangerous.

79
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.270
The interior shots grow steadily brighter as old learns more about young shady

80
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.550
pass. And of course the lighthouse is extreme.

81
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.690
Brightness seems to basically kill young at the end, but it's not totally clear.

82
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.710
Now this film probably has the coolest aesthetics of 2019 full stop,

83
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.640
but try as we might, we couldn't unearth any overarching meaning behind them.

84
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.690
So for this one,

85
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:41.620
we're going to say atmospheric has hell but not quite deep though.

86
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.420
Definitely let us know if we're missing something.

87
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.860
Let's move on to part two sexuality, AKA your high school, gym teachers,

88
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.150
second expertise.

89
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.040
<v 2>Don't have sex cause you will get pregnant and die.</v>

90
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.810
<v 1>From phallic lighthouses to vaginal keyholes sex is front and center,</v>

91
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.050
which is fitting for a movie that features dudes jerking their lighthouses about

92
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.620
every five minutes. It's most obvious in the tensions between young and old,

93
00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:07.710
who like your boomer parents vacillate between yelling at each other and

94
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.240
embarrassingly slow dancing.

95
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.990
The queerish subtexts are pretty clear and Eggers along with actors,

96
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:16.050
Robert Pattinson and Willem Defoe told the Huffington post that this was

97
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:18.570
intentional. The whole thing is about power dynamics.

98
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.900
So it is about Willem pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing,

99
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.560
and there's pent up anger and pent up erotic energy and pent up smells.

100
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.450
Where is that breaking point? Indeed,

101
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:30.450
the struggle for power is central to the plot. Old claims,

102
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.470
absolute control telling young to throw the rule book way because he's the King

103
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:35.160
of this.

104
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.850
<v 2>Castle manuals. My longest book on this rock. Yeah.</v>

105
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.330
<v 1>Alternates between telling young to do the hardest possible chores and yelling</v>

106
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:44.370
at him for having supposedly done them wrong.

107
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.070
Even dangles him from a rope just to be a jerk.

108
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.740
These dynamics come to fruition in a bizarre mirror image.

109
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:53.310
When young takes old for a walk like he's a dog and an image that feels straight

110
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.820
out of a kink handbook here, a young is expressing the dehumanization.

111
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.330
He felt when old regularly called him a dog.

112
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.960
<v 3>Small dog smell.</v>

113
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.790
<v 1>And reclaiming his power taken on its own old behavior is just dickish put in</v>

114
00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:09.910
the context of physical and emotional relationships with young though,

115
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.600
it becomes pretty clearly erotic as if to bring the point home Eggers of Oaks.

116
00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:14.950
The work of Sasha Snyder,

117
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.850
a late 19th century painter who had to flee Germany because of his sexuality.

118
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.610
And one of the film's most striking moments, Eggers recreates,

119
00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:23.710
this Schneider painting called hypnosis,

120
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.460
which depicts one man's face shining light onto the face of a younger man as if

121
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:30.700
revealing some frightening and seductive truth is Eggers.

122
00:06:30.701 --> 00:06:34.090
Perhaps suggesting that interacting with old reveal, some frightening,

123
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:38.260
but seductive truth about young, maybe a new gradation of his sexuality.

124
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.320
Now we're not saying that they're gay and neither is Eggers.

125
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.680
It's hardly that simple, regardless of which way they typically swing.

126
00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:48.730
They enter into a tacitly erotic relationship out of loneliness or genuine

127
00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:49.840
sexual attraction.

128
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.200
They're each fulfilling a need of the other old gets to feel in control.

129
00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:56.740
Despite living in a world, dictated by the uncontrollable forces of the sea.

130
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.700
And as for young Robert Pattinson explained to his character and a lot of ways

131
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.820
he sort of wants a daddy and boy, does he get one?

132
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.870
The pure erotic fascination has given plenty of time to brew on screen.

133
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.710
There's lots of secretly watching one another from a distance and old even calls

134
00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:15.070
young DSM picture. There's also moments of reprieve,

135
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.080
softer images of their relationship.

136
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.410
Like when they sit peacefully by the fire as old engages in your traditionally

137
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:22.180
domestic hobby of knitting, however,

138
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:25.270
they still manage to make even peaceful feminized tasks,

139
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.360
impetus for more hyper-masculine aggression, not incidentally,

140
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.110
their most tumultuous fight erupts over whether or not young likes olds cooking.

141
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.590
<v 3>I seen it. You're fun to me, loves them.</v>

142
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.980
<v 1>Rather than expressing his pain and vulnerability.</v>

143
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:43.990
Something he might see as overly feminine,

144
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.530
old immediately turns to his most wildly violent impulses,

145
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.600
literally calling on Triton to, uh.

146
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.820
<v 3>Joe G and gorging your organs stay, eat turned blue,</v>

147
00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:58.570
and don't take with bill and Brian and can stream no.

148
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.880
<v 1>Yeah. That old sick Seadog monologue brings us to another point.</v>

149
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.870
The films treatment of the nebulous line between sex and death take this

150
00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:10.300
climactic moment. When young finally sees the light.

151
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:13.870
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

152
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.040
<v 1>What is he experiencing?</v>

153
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.990
Just pain or a weird pleasure in pain that strange duality has fascinated

154
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:23.710
many thinkers, including George [inaudible], whose book Aero, autism, death,

155
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.670
and sensuality outlines the odd relationship between these two aspects of human

156
00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:29.500
experience. According to [inaudible],

157
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.180
we are from the very beginning individuals existing in a state of discontinuity

158
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:38.080
from those around us, that is a state of isolation and loneliness.

159
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.920
Death jerks us out of a tenacious obsession with the lastingness of our

160
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.750
discontinuous being that is,

161
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:48.280
it literally destroys our sense of a singular separate self in doing so.

162
00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:52.960
It actually affirms our continuity of being or as literary scholar Nadella two

163
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:54.100
puts it in depth.

164
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.890
We go from separate beings to a common ontological ground of being

165
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.060
because we both desire that continuity and fear are inevitable death.

166
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.010
We search for continuity elsewhere, specifically in eroticism as Baton put it.

167
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.730
The whole business of eroticism is to destroy the self-contained character of

168
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:14.430
the participators as they are in their normal lives.

169
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.930
I eat to destroy our discontinuity by uniting intimately with another in this

170
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:21.570
way, eroticism is a psychological quest,

171
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.530
not alien to debt because both were about recovering our lost continuity

172
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.440
overcoming our profound sense of separation.

173
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.840
This idea feels very present in the lighthouse.

174
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.930
Most apparently when young finally sees the alluring lantern,

175
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.450
which has already been thoroughly sexualized,

176
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.900
the moment feels in line with [inaudible] definition of the sacred,

177
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:41.460
in that it seems to cause young,

178
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.970
both divine ecstasy and extreme horror of phenomenon.

179
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:48.270
We also see in Young's earlier masturbatory adventure in the shed,

180
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.060
which ends with him on his knees in pain. Now,

181
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.570
according to [inaudible] the experience of the erotic that is the tearing down

182
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:59.190
of your usual self containment is a rupture. His erotic system is often violent.

183
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.970
The link between violence and erotics manifest in the many brawls between young

184
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:03.451
and old,

185
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:06.930
when they can be just as easily about to make love as they are about to kill one

186
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:10.230
another. But the dichotomy is most glaringly obvious in the moment,

187
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:13.440
right after the two almost kiss. When instead of locking lips,

188
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.090
they lock fists right here.

189
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:18.720
We have a textbook example of two dudes not being able to distinguish between

190
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:21.840
love and violence fittingly for this moment. But tile pine,

191
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:24.960
that extreme seductiveness is at the boundary of horror,

192
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.740
which we certainly see in Young's frightened reaction to old's embrace and the

193
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:32.010
lighthouse. There's a poorest relationship between sex and death,

194
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.300
love and violence, some literal and some symbolic more subtly.

195
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:39.960
There's the ongoing motif of a post-coital cigarette first scene when young

196
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:42.990
lights up after jerking into his favorite half woman, half fish,

197
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.820
of course the Postbank SIG is coily being repurposed for both sexual and violent

198
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:50.820
encounters. Young describes wanting a cigarette after watching,

199
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:53.190
letting and or causing his boss to die.

200
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.890
<v 4>I could think when he was done was I,</v>

201
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.450
I could use me as smoke.

202
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.880
<v 1>And he also lights up after killing old.</v>

203
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.240
What's more the original script even has him doing the same thing after killing

204
00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:07.640
the seagull underscoring, Eggers intentions,

205
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.360
similarly old poles up his suspenders after his rendezvous with a lamp,

206
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.980
a moment the script describes as,

207
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.310
as if getting dressed after a night with a woman echoing this moment,

208
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.370
young pulls up his suspenders after beating old to a pulp,

209
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.580
as of getting dressed after sex, sex death.

210
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.300
What's the difference all in all the unique take on sexuality and the

211
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:30.440
interesting treatment of the line between sex and death love and violence feels

212
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:33.740
pretty deep to us. Let's conclude by looking at mythology,

213
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.350
the lighthouse evokes parallels to numerous myths,

214
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:40.580
fables and folklores drawn from a myriad of seafaring cultures. For example,

215
00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:44.660
the idea that seagulls contain the souls of dead sailors is a real maritime

216
00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:45.080
myth,

217
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.410
which may have brought about the historical superstition that killing a seabird

218
00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:52.370
is bad luck. This effect was most famously described in the 1798 poem.

219
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.860
The rhyme of ancient Mariner,

220
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.460
which shows a sailor doom has shipped by killing an albatross as punishment.

221
00:11:57.461 --> 00:11:59.560
He is forced to wear the dead bird around his neck.

222
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:01.720
Like an especially unattractive scarf.

223
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.650
Young is regularly tormented by a hostile one eyed seagull upon learning that

224
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:08.770
the Virtus team, Jacob, he beats it to death in a violent rage.

225
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.210
This appears to seal his fate as the wind suddenly changed direction and a storm

226
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:16.540
ensues, but there's more one eyed imagery to hunt your dreams.

227
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.500
When young inquires about the previous junior Wiki old replies that he went mad

228
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:21.334
and died.

229
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.280
<v 3>The second died</v>

230
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.070
went to Maddie did.

231
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.640
<v 1>Later on young seems to hallucinate the severed head of a man with one eye</v>

232
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.830
there's was ones between the one I had former keeper.

233
00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:36.930
And the one I'd seal is undeniable.

234
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.500
So what does it mean was the previous keeper attempting to warn young about the

235
00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:41.910
malevolence of the lighthouse?

236
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.350
Possibly then there's the mermaid who appears both as a figurine and an actual

237
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:48.000
part lady part fish with,

238
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.290
and this is according to Eggers of vagina modeled after that of a sharks equal

239
00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:53.880
parts of beautiful and terrifying.

240
00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:57.660
The mermaid has symbolized erotic danger everywhere from medieval churches to

241
00:12:57.661 --> 00:12:59.970
Greek mythology or sirens learned many,

242
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:02.760
a horny sailor who is due frequently in such tales,

243
00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:05.160
mermaids pull their sailor lovers under water,

244
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.090
leading to some pretty awkward one nightstands such a moment happens during

245
00:13:09.091 --> 00:13:12.960
Young's masturbatory fantasy and or nervous breakdown in this way.

246
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:17.310
The mermaid helps solidify this. After mentioned the link between sex and death,

247
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.740
then there's the other assorted oceanic imagery,

248
00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:21.480
which tends to revolve around old.

249
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.690
This is most notable during the men's deadly fight in which old seems to

250
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:28.650
spontaneously sprout squid tentacles before also fading into a barnacle covered

251
00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:32.700
version of himself. That salary honestly just recalls this guy. Oh,

252
00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:37.200
and he also fades into the mermaid what's going on here is old simply emblematic

253
00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:41.340
of all Silor representing the way some men subsume their lives and identities to

254
00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:44.760
the ocean waves and thus get swallowed up in all its mysteries.

255
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.940
Maybe we honestly don't know. And then of course,

256
00:13:47.941 --> 00:13:50.910
there's the illusion to the Greek myth of Prometheus's the Titan who was

257
00:13:50.911 --> 00:13:54.990
punished by Zeus for stealing the secret of fire and bestowing it up to humanity

258
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.740
in this myth,

259
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.850
fire symbolizes humanity's curiosity for knowledge and triumph over nature.

260
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.480
The titular lighthouse exists in the film as a font of forbidden knowledge and

261
00:14:03.481 --> 00:14:07.410
the object of Young's obsession. And you know, it's also literally a flame.

262
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.010
Now the gods punished Promethease for being a bad boy by chaining him to a rock

263
00:14:11.011 --> 00:14:14.730
for all eternity to have his liver eaten by an Eagle every single day,

264
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.490
only to regenerate at night in the final scene of the film.

265
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:20.280
We see Young's liver being picked upon by a one eyed Siegel,

266
00:14:20.281 --> 00:14:24.540
Allah Prometheus's the gods also punished manity by giving it its first woman

267
00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:29.130
Pandora described in Greek poetry as a beautiful evil through Pandora and her

268
00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:30.000
dang box.

269
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.140
All the evils in the world are released the theme of femininity and beauty as

270
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:38.370
beguiling and dangerous is Telegraph throughout via the mermaid as well as the

271
00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:42.450
assorted attribution of feminine traits and duties to both old and young is

272
00:14:42.451 --> 00:14:46.320
young being punished for stealing the fire of the lighthouse is that the result

273
00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:49.620
of his fear of femininity and his latent desires, to be honest,

274
00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:53.480
we're not totally sure. And we're totally sure if it's deep. Okay.

275
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:56.630
So this is honestly been one of the harder films we've ever analyzed.

276
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.900
And we think we know why Eggerss himself has said that he wanted to make the

277
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:03.110
movie in conclusive. He wanted to raise more questions than answers.

278
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.080
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

279
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.200
<v 1>To spend hours on Reddit,</v>

280
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:13.660
trying to understand the significance of the lobster trap.

281
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.050
This is a pretty cool approach that not many directors are brave enough to take

282
00:15:17.051 --> 00:15:19.870
less. They be labeled pretentious. We truly applaud it.

283
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.750
The only downside is that such an approach can result in the film,

284
00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:26.620
not articulating any clear meaning the lighthouse is many things at once.

285
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.430
A love story, a hate story, a story of madness and obsession.

286
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.110
But despite all these gradations,

287
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.750
no interpretation fully makes it clear statement.

288
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.260
The movie lacks a thesis and it does so intentionally as a result,

289
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.260
we're a little dumbfounded. It's clearly not superficial,

290
00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:44.980
but can you be deep if you're not fully articulating a message we're genuinely

291
00:15:44.981 --> 00:15:45.611
not sure.

292
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.910
So we're going to split the difference and say quite possibly deep and quite

293
00:15:48.911 --> 00:15:50.260
certainly not dumb.

294
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.070
But what do you think wisecrack as Robert Eggers broken deeper, dumb,

295
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:58.330
or is there another interpretation? We like a one eyed Siegel simply cannot see,

296
00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.620
let us know what you think in the comments.

297
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.890
