00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.220
<v 0>This video is brought to you by vincero</v>

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.370
What's up wisecrack Michael here today. I want to talk about something.

3
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:14.060
We've all been watching a story that explores America's founding principles by

4
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.570
adding a hefty dose of hip hop parks and recreation.

5
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.710
You likely think of parks and rec as a show about small town,

6
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:26.570
government woodsmen, libertarianism,

7
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:28.790
or the dangers of doing business with the Safferstein.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.100
<v 1>No, she's the worst.</v>

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.270
<v 0>But what if it's an accidental masterclass and the struggles of founding a new</v>

10
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:42.620
country now to say parks and rec is a show about America's founding might sound

11
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:43.820
like a stretch, but remember,

12
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:47.930
the co-creator might share is the same guy that made an entire sitcom about

13
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:48.650
philosophy.

14
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.530
<v 1>It's like who died and left Aristotle in charge of ethics.</v>

15
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.140
<v 0>Okay. Even if Mike sure. Wasn't reading the notebooks of Thomas Jefferson,</v>

16
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.430
his comedic musings on life and Pawnee may help us learn more about a very basic

17
00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:03.740
problem for people trying to start a country from scratch.

18
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.880
That is how do you stop it from collapsing in on itself.

19
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.210
Welcome to this wisecrack edition on the political philosophy of parks and

20
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:12.470
recreation and spoilers.

21
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.180
<v 1>Ahead for the show and Hamilton.</v>

22
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.010
<v 0>But before we get into it,</v>

23
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:18.800
I'm going to give a shout out to this week's sponsor of in chair and Cheryl

24
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:21.170
watches are stylish, bold, and built to last.

25
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.660
They are hand-crafted and have the same feel as a luxury watch,

26
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.350
but at a fraction of the price right now, I'm wearing the coronal S in black.

27
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.230
And I really love how the watch elevates any outfit.

28
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.390
Even if you're in a t-shirt and jeans this past year,

29
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:34.580
even Cero has released four brand new collections,

30
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:38.120
including an automatic movement watch called the icon or rugged Explorer watch

31
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.000
called the outrider and a sleek race watch called the apex,

32
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:44.360
which includes a limited edition marble release that will be sold out soon to

33
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.120
celebrate the release of their new collections and their six year anniversary.

34
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.160

42
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.620
parks and rec follows the inner workings of Pawnee Indiana's parks department

43
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:15.770
headed by Ron Swanson and his over-eager deputy Leslie Knope.

44
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.510
Leslie has an almost childlike admiration for American style democracy and

45
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:22.010
believes that with good natured leaders,

46
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:25.400
the government has the ability to make our world a better place. However,

47
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:29.720
she is surrounded by people who are at best empathetic and at worst downright

48
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:31.100
hostile to her grand plan.

49
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.420
<v 1>I don't want this parks department to build any parks because I don't believe in</v>

50
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.254
government.

51
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.090
<v 0>Forwarded at every step.</v>

52
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:41.840
As she tries to build a park where an empty pit wants to take on big sugar or

53
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:43.970
stop people from drinking from water fountains like.

54
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.290
<v 1>Yeah, so the idea is to make a fountain that he can't do that.</v>

55
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.610
<v 0>Before he was famous for being a deft Broadway lyricist Hamilton,</v>

56
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:56.180
along with James Madison and John Jay wrote a series of articles meant to sway

57
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.710
public opinion towards the creation of a unified nation of States through the

58
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:02.440
constitution and a strong national government. You know,

59
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.180
the United States of America,

60
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.880
these articles referred to as the Federalist papers,

61
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.050
were responding to existing criticisms of the proposed union and preempted any

62
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:11.884
yet to come.

63
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.460
And while the stakes of forming a union out of 13 individual States and throwing

64
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.700
a Pawnee unity concert might not be quite the same.

65
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.450
These early debates about American government can help us better understand

66
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.230
what's really going on in parks and rec. So let's start with problem one,

67
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.730
the danger of factions,

68
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.820
whether you're a local parks department or the head of a national government.

69
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.120
There's one thing you got to watch out for different groups of people,

70
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.860
all with very specific interests,

71
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.770
all yelling at each other in a way that devolves into chaos.

72
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.720
<v 1>No, you promise you promise. That's not fair.</v>

73
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.250
Is that a question of fairness? It's separation to Russia, Kami back to Russia.

74
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.830
<v 0>If you're a student of Pawnees town hall meetings, you might've noticed a theme,</v>

75
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.010
no matter what level headed plan, Leslie and veils,

76
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.460
there's some person or group who feels like their rights as an American have

77
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:00.600
been trampled upon. Okay.

78
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.840
<v 1>What's next income, sir. You don't pay your income tax.</v>

79
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.850
<v 0>That I pay income taxes,</v>

80
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.490
none of the government's business try to make Pawnee healthier.

81
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:11.370
And this guy is mad. He has to go out of his way to the nearest paunch Berg.

82
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.430
Now, if I want to start my day off with a triple Decker pancake breakfast pizza,

83
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.960
I got to go the one that's 10 minutes away.

84
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:19.110
And that makes me 20 minutes late to work. Every day I work at home.

85
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.180
Have you ever considered not eating that for breakfast?

86
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.020
I'll never consider that during these meetings and throughout the show,

87
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.860
Leslie and the parks department are met with an onslaught of hyper specific and

88
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:32.670
constantly annoyed citizens and interest groups who are never satisfied with

89
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:33.560
anything. There isn't.

90
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.240
<v 1>Disturbing lack of benches in Ranjit park.</v>

91
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.150
<v 0>Factions in turn trample on the rights of others.</v>

92
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.880
Like when seniors can't learn how to not catch chlamydia,

93
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.820
because it offends the society for family stability foundation.

94
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.540
<v 1>If we allow this film to be taught to our seniors, the next thing you know,</v>

95
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.270
it'll be in our high schools that our kindergartens and before, you know,

96
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:54.540
we have babies and thong underwear, is that what you want? Yes,

97
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:55.374
that's what I want.

98
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.250
<v 0>Believe it or not.</v>

99
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.330
It was exactly this kind of chaos that James Madison was trying to avoid by

100
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:03.420
creating a federal Republic to unify the States. Sure.

101
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:05.430
He might not have meant bench people,

102
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.300
but he was acutely aware of how say one religious group could tie radically

103
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:12.780
impose their will on others. Madison in Federalist. Number 10,

104
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.660
defines a faction as a number of citizens,

105
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:19.740
whether a mounting to a majority or a minority of the whole or United and

106
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.970
actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest adverse to the rights

107
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:27.900
of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interest of the community

108
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.890
while Leslie's chipper attitude tries to solve the problem of factions with

109
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.753
inclusivity.

110
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.680
<v 1>So what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring</v>

111
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:38.580
loudly at me.

112
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.020
<v 0>Madison argues that the solution to factions is to either destroy their cause or</v>

113
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:46.560
limit their effects and while removing the causes for the faction sounds

114
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:47.250
convenient.

115
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.270
Madison points out that the only ways you could do this would be by destroying

116
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.930
the Liberty that lets factions exist in the first place or more creepily,

117
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.180
giving every citizen the same opinions, same passions and the same interests.

118
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.020
In other words,

119
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.220
if Leslie simply indoctrinated everyone into her binder called there would be no

120
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.580
pesky, Jeremy jams trying to put a punch burger on her beloved park.

121
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.990
<v 2>I want to sell this lot to poncho burger. Here's why we make money.</v>

122
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.200
They make money. They make burgers. We eat burgers.

123
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.710
<v 0>Since removing the causes of factions. Isn't really an option.</v>

124
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.120
How does one limit their effects for Madison factions are especially bad in

125
00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:23.110
smaller republics.

126
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.710
Local politics makes it easier for super rich neighborhood weirdos,

127
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:30.430
like the Newports to impose their will on an entire area. If you go bigger,

128
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:33.970
Madison thought the competing factions might balance each other out a bit,

129
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.050
but then again,

130
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:38.620
he didn't really foresee the rise of the internet or multinational corporations,

131
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.560
but that's a video for a different day. Parks and rec.

132
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:45.640
On the other hand has a novel solution to a certain kind of factionalism in the

133
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:47.560
time capsule episode. And this episode,

134
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:50.980
a man with a creepy Twilight obsession wants to get the book put in the town's

135
00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:53.770
time capsule to impress his daughter, the town hall meetings,

136
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:57.400
predictably spiral out of control as groups and individuals with misaligned

137
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.910
interests,

138
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.840
all fight to have the Bible weird paintings and dead people's ashes included in

139
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:04.870
the project. We can get a little Madison in here. Sure.

140
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.770
Since it would be a huge overstep to try to eliminate the source of people's

141
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:12.400
feuding about whether Twilight is demonic propaganda or an important cultural

142
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.180
touchstone,

143
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.510
the role of government is to develop mechanisms for controlling the fallout.

144
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.380
One of Madison's solutions was to have a space for the rabble to express their

145
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:23.830
grievances while making sure the system kept their shenanigans contained.

146
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.881
In this light,

147
00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:28.300
we might consider the town hall meetings as an important pressure valve for

148
00:07:28.301 --> 00:07:29.290
public sentiments.

149
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.210
<v 3>What are you still got a moron?</v>

150
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.690
Why don't you have hand dryers in the park bathrooms?

151
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.300
There's so much more sanitary than paper towels.

152
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.380
<v 0>People air their grievances might just keep the weirdos from lining up outside</v>

153
00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:43.330
city hall with muskets and weirdly.

154
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.210
This is a huge mechanism of the Constitution's design,

155
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.740
letting all the chaos and anger of a democracy be expressed without giving into

156
00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:53.710
the actual unfiltered will of the people. There's two ways.

157
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:55.270
We can look at this on one hand,

158
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:59.440
having just survived a revolutionary war motivated by factional dispute between

159
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.920
England and the colonies. The founders understood the importance of controlling,

160
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.070
angry minorities, who would inevitably be at odds with government rule.

161
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.000
On the other hand,

162
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.120
they were equally worried about the poor masses who were larger numbers in the

163
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:11.080
landowning classes,

164
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.830
rising up and taking power from their buddies who own both land and people.

165
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.460
And that's not even getting into how afraid they were of slavery volts. Again,

166
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:23.230
a topic for another time besides revolts of the pores or slaves or both allied

167
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:26.620
together, Madison and his fellow Federalists had another problem.

168
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.650
How do we convince the skeptical States to join our new union?

169
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.140
And while Pawnee isn't even a state,

170
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:36.220
we can see some of the same exact problems at play in Indiana Eagleton.

171
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.070
Pawnees ritzy neighbors, the seeded from Pawnee long ago,

172
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.460
disgusted by the filth of the undesirable pores of their neighborhood.

173
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.640
That all changes. However, when they go bankrupt while Eagle,

174
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.970
then isn't pushing for a compromise over slavery. Thank God.

175
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.840
They are like many of the Southern States hesitant to give up their freedoms and

176
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.670
rejoin the town upon eight, built over hot spring with a microclimate,

177
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.510
all its own.

178
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.870
It's an example of how hard it can be to get different cities or States to join

179
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:03.660
together for the greater good Eagleton is richer cleaner.

180
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.170
The town hall meetings are exquisite. Look how pretty the people are.

181
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.650
Why would they ever want Pawnee ins to come ruining their nice parks?

182
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.580
Eagleton is in this sense, like an anti-federalists state, unlike an Eagle,

183
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:18.450
Tony and Leslie Knope sees the value in Pawnee being part of something greater

184
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:22.170
than itself. Even when Eagleton is broken full of condescending.

185
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.230
I live in Eagleton and frankly, I don't like the idea of living in Pawnee.

186
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.790
They're a little, what's the word afternoon money. And believe it or not,

187
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.810
Eagleton's bankruptcy is actually a pretty great stand in for one specific

188
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:39.950
hesitancy in joining into a union of States debt, have you seen Hamilton?

189
00:09:39.951 --> 00:09:43.610
You'll remember the definitely historically accurate rap battle between Thomas

190
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.670
Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton and which they use their lyrical prowess to

191
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:50.300
debate the question of whether debts and wealth should be shared through the

192
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:54.140
federal government, or if a state being broke was their own dumb problems.

193
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.070
Oh, if the SU fits where we hit New York city,

194
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.530
that's a pain, I'm afraid don't tax the South.

195
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.300
Cause we got it made in the shade.

196
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.260
This was an important question in the wake of the revolutionary war as both the

197
00:10:09.261 --> 00:10:13.160
federal government and the States were in massive debt to the tune of 54 and

198
00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:17.600
$25 million respectively with paper money as useless as stock and entertainment,

199
00:10:17.601 --> 00:10:21.170
seven 20 and no country wanting to loan money to deadbeat America.

200
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.010
Hamilton's big idea was to absorb all this debt at the federal level and

201
00:10:25.011 --> 00:10:28.970
establish a national bank for heavily indebted States. This was awesome.

202
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.300
But for States like Maryland, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia,

203
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.930
who already paid their debts and men getting taxed to pay off the debt of your

204
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:38.990
broke neighbors, somewhat like the debt ridden States,

205
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.670
Eagleton's only way to survive.

206
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.950
Their crushing debt is to be absorbed into Carney,

207
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.270
forming a new economic union of sorts Pawnees since they haven't repeatedly

208
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.260
failed to pay back,

209
00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:52.280
their debtors extensively can borrow more money to build more parks in schools,

210
00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:55.040
especially after the keen fiscal management of Ben Wyatt.

211
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.690
In the case of the constitution,

212
00:10:56.691 --> 00:11:01.070
the idea was that safe France would be less willing to lend money to say New

213
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.310
Jersey and more willing to trust the cash with the larger and fiscally savvy

214
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:05.180
federal government.

215
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.660
So here parks and rec falls on the side of New York based hip hop artists,

216
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.330
Alexander Hamilton, who said that a national debt,

217
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.300
if it is not excessive will be to us in national blessing.

218
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.140
But now that we've seen why the founding fathers thought that faction should be

219
00:11:18.141 --> 00:11:21.470
tolerated and why a union was stronger than a collection of States,

220
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.400
the question still remains is democracy, even a good system.

221
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.330
Do we really want the type of government that requires a years of meetings and

222
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:32.060
compromises to turn a pit into a community park?

223
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.960
So here we go with problem three, does democracy actually work?

224
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.430
We all know that America is a democracy and democracy is about we the people.

225
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.240
So obviously our friends, Hamilton, Madison and Jay got sweet democracy,

226
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.370
neck tattoos. And for everyone mad that,

227
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.430
well actually America is a democratic Republic.

228
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.090
Zip your burger hole for a second. We're getting there.

229
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.840
The founders were pretty skeptical about the whole while he,

230
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:58.960
the people part of the government and were downright opposed to a world in which

231
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.010
each citizen had a direct say in what's going on John Adams and the defense of

232
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:04.690
the constitution of the United States.

233
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.500
Flat-out worried that unbridled democracy would lead the masses to give up their

234
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:12.010
power immediately to some King or idols of their own creation.

235
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.210
He also worried like Madison that the pores would start using their power to Rob

236
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:18.670
the rich blind and to be fair that the rich,

237
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:22.300
when left to their own devices would simply Rob the poor blind it's worth noting

238
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:25.870
that Adams admired the British form of government with its balance of powers and

239
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:28.960
representative nature, parks and rec, despite being, Oh,

240
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:32.110
so optimistic about the power of one woman to change the world,

241
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.250
really dives into the show that is democracy they're city counselors serving for

242
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:40.360
way too long with their own dumbing Greenways and clear conflicts of interest.

243
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.360
Along with a bonkers ideas held by some of Pawnee citizens.

244
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.150
<v 4>But isn't all food bad for you.</v>

245
00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:48.360
I've been eating lasagna and muffins every day of my life for 40 years.

246
00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:49.290
And I feel terrible.

247
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.860
<v 0>It was because of all this messiness that the founders preferred to call their</v>

248
00:12:52.861 --> 00:12:56.940
invention eight democratic Republic instead of a literal democracy for the

249
00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:59.550
authors of the Federalist papers, commercial republics,

250
00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:03.450
like ours will never be disposed to waste themselves and ruin his contentions

251
00:13:03.451 --> 00:13:04.230
with each other.

252
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.230
They will be governed by mutual interest and will cultivate a spirit of mutual

253
00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:11.400
Amity and conquered a Republic in the eyes of the founding fathers is a system

254
00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:11.911
of government,

255
00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:15.480
which is indirectly controlled by the people with many barriers between

256
00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:18.600
individual citizens and direct decision-making at the government level.

257
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.700
In other words, you need a principal,

258
00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:23.790
Leslie Noper and Perkins to act on behalf of this guy.

259
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.280
<v 4>I'm not worried about swine flu. I already had the swine flu.</v>

260
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.570
I'm worried about the turtle flu.

261
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.140
<v 0>And rather than hoping for some shared patriotic interest Hamilton,</v>

262
00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:34.380
for one thought that it was commerce, not democratic ideals,

263
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:37.710
that would be the true unifying force of the union to put it bluntly.

264
00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:40.440
They figured that people would get over their fights and squabbles.

265
00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:42.540
If it would keep their bank balance, looking pretty,

266
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.060
this in turn would keep them faithful to the nation,

267
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.420
keeping their accounts in the black while we've more than covered the town

268
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:52.320
halls. We can consider this quote from the Federalist papers are not popular

269
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.460
assemblies, frequently subject to the impulses of rage, resentment, jealousy,

270
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.430
avarice, and of other irregular and violent propensities.

271
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.090
Is it not well known that their determinations are often governed by a few

272
00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:06.570
individuals in whom they place confidence and are of course liable to be

273
00:14:06.571 --> 00:14:09.930
tinctured by the passions and views of those individuals. In other words,

274
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.350
there's a few jerks who are going to push public sentiment in a pretty bad

275
00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:14.760
direction while the media,

276
00:14:14.761 --> 00:14:18.090
during their time amounted to rumors spread at the Tavern and printed pamphlets,

277
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.200
we can see the danger of misguided masses with Pawnees own gin soaked Katy

278
00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:23.670
curric, Joan Callan, mezzo,

279
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.020
Calla mezzos talk show Pawnee today has the cloud to make or break local

280
00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:29.070
political careers.

281
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.300
And it can do this all through using emotions like rage and jealousy to Rouse,

282
00:14:33.301 --> 00:14:37.320
TV, addicted citizens in the service of the absolute worst ideas.

283
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.310
<v 1>Yeah. How can you justify raising taxes for something that'll hurt the town?</v>

284
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.550
<v 0>But this of course leaves us with the question of whether the founders were</v>

285
00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:51.350
correct,

286
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.010
thinking that we weren't capable of handling an actual direct democracy and

287
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:58.460
instead needed the barriers of a Republic to keep us from ruining things.

288
00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.210
After all,

289
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.360
we've got plenty of problems caused by special interest groups and career

290
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:03.194
politicians.

291
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.950
It's not that parks and rec is a perfect one-to-one stand in for the arguments

292
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:08.720
of Federalist versus anti-federalists,

293
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.590
but it can serve as a pretty good lesson in what these people were thinking.

294
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.070
But what do you think wisecrack does parks and rec show us the best that

295
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:20.030
American democracy is capable of and well-intentioned folks work together or

296
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:23.390
does it instead lay bare the problems and limitations inherent to a system of

297
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:27.230
government developed over 200 years before it was possible to slide into those
