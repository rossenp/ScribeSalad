<v 0>This video is brought to you by Skillshare.</v>

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.610
Hey, wisecrack, Michael here. If you've worked in an office before,

3
00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.730
you've definitely had to deal with that guy. You know,

4
00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:17.300
the one I'm talking about, he sucks up to the boss, treats minor tasks.

5
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.670
Like they are matters of life or death, hides, knives,

6
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:22.670
and hunting bows throughout the office and skins that face off a dummy.

7
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.910
<v 0>Maybe not those last two,</v>

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.820
if it's not obvious yet I'm talking about paper salesman,

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.750
beet farmer and Battlestar Galactica, superfan, Dwight K Schrute.

11
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.883
Have you seen the office,

12
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.120
then you probably think of him as the embodiment of the worst possible co-worker

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.890
even if he gets a little lovable by the end redemption aside, he's unfriendly,

14
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.341
needlessly,

15
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.760
competitive and obsessed with efficiency in a way that makes him more of an

16
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
algorithm than a human at time at 1245,

17
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.850
he sneezed while keeping his eyes open,

18
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.940
which I always thought was impossible.

19
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.630
What if Dwight was actually right now,

20
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.350
we're not claiming the joints antiques weren't horrifying or just plain mean,

21
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.020
but what it is obsession with machine-like efficiency,

22
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:13.340
without regard for human emotion might end up being better for his peers.

23
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.020
What if paradoxically Dwight is making his working environment better while

24
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.530
simultaneously being the absolute worst? You're welcome.

25
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.720
Welcome to this wisecrack edition on the philosophy of Dwight and spoilers

26
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.460
ahead. But before we get into it, I'm gonna give a shout out to Skillshare.

27
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.240
Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of inspiring classes

28
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:37.850
for creative and curious people with skill share,

29
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.940
you can explore new skills and learn more about the ones you already have.

30
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.510
The asset classes on writing design, productivity, illustration,

31
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:45.560
and so much more.

32
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
Their classes are great for teaching you how to channel your creativity into

33
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.370
whatever you are working on right now. I recommend productivity today,

34
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.640
managing attention in the digital age with Kevin's mascot,

35
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.430
the class helped me pay attention to the places I'd been spending.

36
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:01.940
Most of my time online, I can get lost on social so easily,

37
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.490
and I'd much prefer to spend the time writing or reading.

38
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.030
I learned how to reduce the distractions and prioritize what I actually want to

39
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:09.290
accomplish during my day.

40
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.250
The best part is that you can complete classes at your own pace and right from

41
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:14.330

45
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.760
Now back to the show, a quick primer on Dwight,

46
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.600
he starts as a top performing paper salesman and assistant to the regional

47
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:33.770
manager, Michael Scott.

48
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.310
He also moonlights as a beet farmer and is generally convinced he's better and

49
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:41.210
smarter than everyone else, too many people on this earth. We need a new plague,

50
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.380
have to show Dwight antagonizes, his coworkers, creating fake fire, panics,

51
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.570
driving them to faraway locations, abandoning them,

52
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.930
and just generally being kind of a Dick. Well,

53
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:53.750
thanks for wasting my time tonight, but than anything,

54
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.440
the dude is weirdly obsessed with physical strength and efficiency, to.

55
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 1>Give you a reference point. I'm somewhere a snake and Amongus.</v>

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.860
<v 0>He also loves scifi and distrust computers.</v>

57
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.970
We'll get to that to understand why Dwight might actually be a good guy in the

58
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:07.990
grand scheme of things.

59
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.220
We need to look at a little concept called accelerationism accelerationism has

60
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.490
nothing to do with beet farming or even paper suppliers. Rather.

61
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.360
It's a loosely associated group of thinkers who argue that sometimes the best

62
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.270
way to improve a system is not to improve it at all.

63
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.060
Even going so far as to advocate for speeding up the system,

64
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.780
dysfunction fingers like Karl Marx, Gildea, Luz, and Paul Mason.

65
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.590
Now accelerationist are mostly talking about capitalism.

66
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.630
They think that a capitalism is bad, but B trying to fix it makes it even worse.

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.100
The best we can do from their perspective is to let the global financial system

68
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.650
headfirst into its own self destruction,

69
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.520
pushing for better working conditions or a more humane economy for the

70
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.640
accelerationist is the philosophical equivalent of just me.

71
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.270
Now we're not saying Dwight as some accidental Che Guevara,

72
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.300
but if we take the basic premise that if a system is bad,

73
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.000
we should hit the gas and ride it until the wheels fall off.

74
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.180
This is basically what Dwight does unintentionally or not.

75
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.440
One key component of accelerationism is technology technology disrupts.

76
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:12.190
It makes the world go faster and it also causes a bunch of problems along the

77
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:14.890
way. What does it mean for technology to accelerate?

78
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.120
Consider the fact it took us thousands of years to go from horse and wagon to

79
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.780
car.

80
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.720
And all of a sudden we said it and we're flying in airplanes and going to the

81
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.790
moon in the same century. More recently,

82
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:28.090
we might consider the progress from vinyl record to eight track to cassette

83
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.420
tape, to CD to hear it's thousands of songs on your iPod. Just kidding.

84
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:33.850
It's on your phone now. Instead of course,

85
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:37.780
it's not all fun games and instant access to the entire discography of the Wu

86
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:39.790
Tang clan Dunder Mifflin, for example,

87
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.050
starts at ground zero of what technological acceleration is and can mean for

88
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:44.920
some businesses.

89
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.400
It's a company that provided what was an essential good for virtually every

90
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:53.020
company in the 1980s and nineties rendered obsolete nearly a decade later by

91
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.854
computers.

92
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.230
<v 2>Your own employees calculation. You'll be obsolete in the next five to 10 years.</v>

93
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.343
Wait, Ryan said that.

94
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.550
<v 0>More importantly,</v>

95
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.570
technology in the business world is about efficiency and speed. Now, Dwight,

96
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.990
isn't exactly a fan of computers since they might do a Skynet,

97
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.920
but he's basically trying to turn himself into a machine wearing hydration,

98
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:17.820
backpacks and peeing into bottles to save time is basically just a Jeff Bezos

99
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.910
fever dream, or just reality for joy work.

100
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.330
Isn't about providing a place for folks to earn a decent living for 40 hours a

101
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:24.870
week.

102
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.250
It's about sacrificing all individuality and emotion to serve the gods of the

103
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:30.084
bottom line.

104
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.610
<v 2>How would I describe myself? Three words,</v>

105
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.570
hardworking alpha male Jack hammer.

106
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.740
<v 0>Well, it looks like capitalist efficiency for some looks like joblessness and</v>

107
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:44.670
obsolescence for others as British acceleration is Steve Goodman notes.

108
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.980
We all live in an operating system,

109
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:51.600
set up by the accelerating triad of war capitalism and emergent AI.

110
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.640
And that operating system doesn't really give a about traditional business or

111
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:01.100
human values songs. The scary AI, Dwight is all about this.

112
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.460
Even if he spurns consumer technology less did make him weak.

113
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.630
<v 3>What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless.</v>

114
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.280
<v 0>Rather he takes on the technological rationale of speed and efficiency,</v>

115
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.650
even at the cost of basic human dignity.

116
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.130
Take the time he was tasked by Michael with picking out a new healthcare plan

117
00:06:18.131 --> 00:06:18.964
for Dunder Mifflin.

118
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.540
Does he take into consideration the diversity of his coworkers health needs to

119
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:25.480
pick a plan that offers the most comprehensive care number one.

120
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.410
<v 3>Inverted penis. Could you mean vagina?</v>

121
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.290
Because if you do, I want that.

122
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.390
<v 0>Hell no. He slashes things down to a bare bones plan to save the company money.</v>

123
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.800
<v 3>Slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh?</v>

124
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.350
Maybe I don't believe in coddling people.

125
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.950
<v 0>Well, his thought process isn't grounded in what's best for human beings.</v>

126
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:50.410
It's grounded in the tenants of capitalist efficiency,

127
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.630
which he values over humanity. How many.

128
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.950
<v 3>People can I fire a nun? You're picking a health care plan.</v>

129
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.373
Okay. We'll table that.

130
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.310
<v 0>The time being now, you might be asking, how is this good?</v>

131
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.000
But consider this what Dwight is doing is probably not much worse than what

132
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:09.670
anyone from corporate looking to slash costs would have done.

133
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.510
<v 3>The whole reason that we're doing this is to save money.</v>

134
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.350
So you just need to pick a provider and then choose the cheese.

135
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.340
<v 0>Instead, Dwight, by embracing the logical extreme of cost,</v>

136
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:25.540
cutting everyone off to the point that they rebel his actions,

137
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.900
force his coworkers to band together and demand something better.

138
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:31.210
And maybe without Dwight pushing things,

139
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.540
they would have merely accepted whatever garbage health plan they were offered.

140
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.930
<v 3>Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job. Uh, Dwight,</v>

141
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.100
did you raise benefits? I most certainly did not. Okay.

142
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.260
<v 0>Come on. That's horrible. This is what,</v>

143
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:48.310
the more progressive advocates for accelerationism hope that by making reality

144
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:51.100
more extreme, things will actually get better.

145
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.850
And this isn't a completely new theory of change just throughout history.

146
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:58.360
The most significant revolutions come from extreme circumstances.

147
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.710
Think of the French revolution,

148
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:03.280
a product of dire poverty among the peasants and ocular wealth amongst the

149
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:06.580
ruling aristocracy rather than sitting around, waiting for change.

150
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.220
Acceleration is want to pour fuel on the fire.

151
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.480
We can contrast Dwight's brutal logic with his superior. Michael Scott,

152
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.140
who makes terrible fiscal decisions because he's prioritizing the feelings of

153
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:19.240
the people around him over efficiency.

154
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.400
<v 3>Wants everything in our company to be about emails and I AM's.</v>

155
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:29.230
But I think he is forgetting about the original instant message

156
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.540
letters attached to baskets of food.

157
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.670
<v 0>Whether it's for selfish reasons or not.</v>

158
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.480
Michael airs on the side of people over profits, good manager,

159
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:42.010
doesn't fire people. He hires people.

160
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.370
If Dwight embodies the futuristic politics of accelerationism,

161
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.320
then Michael embodies an old school,

162
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:51.340
liberal political philosophy that places emphasis on a decent life for all of

163
00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:52.150
his employees.

164
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.710
<v 3>Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you're part of a family. It's not family,</v>

165
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.090
it's a workplace.

166
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.580
<v 0>Rather than Dwight's dystopian vision of efficiency.</v>

167
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.820
Michael seems to prefer something like you would have seen in the rust belt in

168
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:06.780
the 1950s where working a good job at the factory meant everyone could afford to

169
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.550
start a family and own a home.

170
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.460
<v 3>But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to</v>

171
00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:17.630
sleep and try it all again the next night.

172
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.141
<v 0>Well,</v>

173
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:21.830
this all sounds very nice and accelerationist would tell you that it's about as

174
00:09:21.831 --> 00:09:24.380
likely to make a comeback as video rental stores.

175
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.400
Dwight's attitude is more at home in our contemporary era of techno capitalism

176
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.890
than Michael's old school people-based style of business.

177
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.590
As Silicon Valley culture transforms into political ideology principles like

178
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.890
hyper efficiency and automation are becoming touchstones in industries,

179
00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:45.680
ranging from jet propulsion to healthcare, to home cooking.

180
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.850
This innovation involves an open embrace of capitalism in all of its techno

181
00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:53.030
utopian glory Joya from this type of ideology.

182
00:09:53.031 --> 00:09:56.930
When he hunts down time thieves in the company who are wasting even a moment of

183
00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:00.860
their working day on personal inefficiencies, time, thief, fire him.

184
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.630
<v 3>Right? You've really never stolen. Any company done never.</v>

185
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.450
<v 0>And while Dwight might fear and detests computers,</v>

186
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.100
it's fitting that his one true worthy adversary is a computer that also sells

187
00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:13.934
paper.

188
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.140
Dwight takes this competitor on winds and in doing so shows that he might be

189
00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:20.360
more machine than man after all,

190
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.500
but we're not arguing that Dwight is secretly a monster only for the sake of

191
00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:27.560
inspiring revolution from his coworkers far from it.

192
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.290
He just wants power and control.

193
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.730
<v 4>The Japanese camp guards of world war II always chose one man to kill whenever a</v>

194
00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:36.170
batch of new prisoners arrived.

195
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.490
I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die.

196
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.510
I think I would have been good at choosing the person.

197
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.300
<v 0>We see this tendency at play when Dwight is momentarily.</v>

198
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:51.890
Given what he thinks is absolute rule over the office or ruthlessness comes to

199
00:10:51.891 --> 00:10:54.590
the surface. The moment he's in power over his own kingdom,

200
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.100
complete with his own evil queen chicken, be in charge of the women.

201
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.320
He seems to be implicitly acknowledging the inefficiencies of traditional

202
00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:10.280
democratic structures. As he installed his own profit prioritizing system,

203
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.160
Dwight rarely gets explicit about his politics,

204
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.790
but we know that he has some definite tendencies towards authoritarianism.

205
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.430
At one point, Jim helps to write out by printing out,

206
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:20.600
talking points for a speech.

207
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.220
<v 3>I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators like this one</v>

208
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.070
originally given by Benito Mussolini.

209
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.480
<v 0>And because Dwight is Dwight,</v>

210
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:33.140
he is immediately inspired and empowered by the fascist crows.

211
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.310
<v 3>Blood alone moves the wheels of history.</v>

212
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.900
<v 0>And of course there are the frequent ins that Dwight's German ancestors might</v>

213
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:43.090
have been literal. Now.

214
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.960
<v 4>My grandpa Manheim is 103 and still puttering around down in</v>

215
00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:50.750
Argentina. I tried to go visit him once,

216
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.280
but my travel visa was protested by the show of Dwight.

217
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.740
<v 0>Is accelerating for accelerating sake,</v>

218
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.510
not to help break the system and his affinity for fascism yearly resembles the

219
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:03.520
dangers of accelerationist thinking,

220
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:07.900
but let's return to the Dwight Michael dichotomy of accelerationism versus old

221
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:11.920
school liberalism rather than viewing technology and innovation as a mechanism

222
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:15.220
to unleash the spirit of capitalism to remake the world and its image.

223
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.760
Michael seems to view technology as a threat to the traditions of the American

224
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:19.410
workplace.

225
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:24.390
<v 3>We have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks because it's illegal.</v>

226
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.780
<v 0>Dwight is trying to move beyond the need for human labor. Michael,</v>

227
00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:31.770
can't imagine a world where he's not spending 40 plus hours a week hanging out

228
00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:33.810
under harsh fluorescent lighting with his butts.

229
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.860
<v 3>Life and business are about human connections</v>

230
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.290
and computers are about trying to murder you in a Lake.

231
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.600
And to me, the choice is easy.

232
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.720
<v 0>And we see the tension between Dwight and Michael's perspectives.</v>

233
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:52.440
When they go on a covert mission to gather Intel from a local mom and pop a

234
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.283
paper business,

235
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.060
Michael recoiled in horror at the thought of destroying the business of these

236
00:12:57.061 --> 00:12:58.380
good wholesome people,

237
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.220
Dwight views them as just the acceptable collateral damage of the free market

238
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.570
paradoxically though,

239
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.290
by making the workplace much more pleasant and humane in the short term,

240
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.440
Michael's approach actually keeps things stuck, right where they are.

241
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.380
No one is forming a secret union to overthrow Michael,

242
00:13:13.381 --> 00:13:17.100
just because of the occasional appearance of prison. Mike, on prison, Mike,

243
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.300
speaking of prison, Mike,

244
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.620
he invents the character after his workers realized they'd rather be in a prison

245
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:26.820
than at work or realization that comes so slowly because their work prison is

246
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.950
obviously skated by Michael's friendly antics.

247
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.390
Dwight who makes things more unbearable in the immediate sense can actually

248
00:13:33.391 --> 00:13:36.690
create the conditions for change by taking systems to their logical,

249
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:37.800
extreme joy,

250
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.370
even explicitly recognizes his logic when he becomes landlord of the office

251
00:13:41.371 --> 00:13:43.710
building and as antiques go too far,

252
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.500
he takes a Labrot measures to save on building costs,

253
00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:48.630
including half ply toilet paper. Don't get.

254
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.880
<v 4>Me started on how cuddled the modern anuses.</v>

255
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.601
<v 0>Afterwards.</v>

256
00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:55.200
He has a legitimate showdown with Pam who threatens to find a new office.

257
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.980
Dwight in typical Dwight fashion thinks of his relationship with his tenants as

258
00:13:58.981 --> 00:13:59.814
a war.

259
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.340
<v 4>Wanting a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant,</v>

260
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.300
not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics.

261
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.860
<v 0>Eventually realizes that the best vampires don't drain all the blood from their</v>

262
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:11.790
victims at once.

263
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.730
<v 4>They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry,</v>

264
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.510
but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again.

265
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.570
<v 0>In a nutshell, Dwight is realizing that his acceleration,</v>

266
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.680
his practices will lead to open revolt and that he must reign in his short-term

267
00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:27.660
greed for long-term stability.

268
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.480
And whether it be Silicon Valley or Dwight Truett,

269
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.070
the process of acceleration can either make things way better or much worse with

270
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.700
not a lot in between. And a recent example,

271
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.280
Silicon Valley's desire to develop things like facial recognition technology,

272
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.180
because people who see this technology as a wild invasion of privacy to organize

273
00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:48.240
and fight against it complete with a last week tonight, take down.

274
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.160
<v 3>Okay. And the Terminator Skynet is evil reigns down death from.</v>

275
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.960
<v 5>This guy, but in China, Skynet is good. Now the difference,</v>

276
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.120
Oh.

277
00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.530
<v 0>That's the difference is it's.</v>

278
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.160
So maybe Dwight's tyranny will ultimately lead to a better workplace,

279
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.830
but maybe it won't by the end of the series,

280
00:15:05.831 --> 00:15:09.730
he establishes himself as the Kim Jong IL of Scranton Pennsylvania paper.

281
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.010
And people seem okay with it.

282
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.540
Maybe Dwight holds onto this power and just makes things even worse for everyone

283
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.374
to Dunder Mifflin,

284
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.070
firing as many folks as he can and creating a living hell for those stuck there.

285
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.630
<v 5>Get out. What does that mean? It's a colloquial way of saying you're fired.</v>

286
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.910
<v 0>The danger of acceleration isn't as,</v>

287
00:15:27.911 --> 00:15:31.960
as its critics have noted that maybe the wheels won't come flying off,

288
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.490
maybe things won't get better.

289
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.630
Maybe we'll just end up with Dwight as the boss forever. But what do you think?

290
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.540
Did things have to get worse to get better to we encourage it?

291
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:43.810
Or is it just too risky? Let us know you think in the comments,
