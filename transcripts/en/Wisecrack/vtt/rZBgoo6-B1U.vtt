<v 0>This video is brought to you by paradox interactive.</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.780
What's up wisecrack Jared,

3
00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:12.470
here to talk about the show with the best fans on the internet, Rick and Morty.

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.040
Now the most recent episode is one of our favorite of the seasons so far.

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.030
I mean, it's good.

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.560
<v 1>Wet eggs. I told you not to look at that egg. It was too wet and well, uh,</v>

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.570
you know, honestly, I'm proud of us for not, but what we found.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.990
<v 0>The most interesting about this episode is the basic question. It poses.</v>

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.270
How much should nature define us?

10
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.330
Welcome to this wisecrack quick take on Rick and Morty season four,

11
00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:38.240
episode seven from Mauritius and de.

12
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.350
<v 1>Spoilers ahead.</v>

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.830
<v 0>But before we get into it, I want to give a shout out to this week.</v>

14
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.310
Sponsor paradox interactive. Right now they're addictive games.

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.690
Dolores is available for free on steam in this four X strategy game.

16
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:55.010
You get to customize the universe. You pick an empire name, your alien race,

17
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:57.170
and explore space. As you progress,

18
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.500
to be able to colonize and take over the entire universe,

19
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.900
you can choose what matters the most to your native empire.

20
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:05.210
By focusing on serving other solar systems,

21
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.070
growing your own galaxies government,

22
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.600
or by designing new ships and buildings for colonies. The game is so detailed.

23
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:14.930
It gives you the ability to customize everything down to the names of the

24
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:16.100
individual characters.

25
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.940
You can micromanage every aspect of your growing civilization from monitoring

26
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:22.670
trade and resources to select government leaders.

27
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.780
While also focusing on the big stuff like growing your battleships or colonizing

28
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:30.500
other planets this week, the game is celebrating its fourth anniversary,

29
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:34.160
which means you can play for free right now when you click the link in the

30
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.920
description. And now back to the show.

31
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.180
So the basic premise of primordial is this there's a parasitic face hugging

32
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:43.970
alien species that exerts total control of their host.

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.080
And as a lifespan of about 30 minutes after depositing, an egg said,

34
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:51.350
host explodes killing itself. And the proud parasite mom.

35
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.320
<v 1>Suck on a face and die.</v>

36
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.880
<v 0>But some are using a foolproof oral defense mechanism, escapes, enslavement,</v>

37
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.290
and convinces the parasites to forgo the reproductive urges, to live a longer,

38
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.360
more fulfilling life. As a result,

39
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:09.560
the parasites are able to quickly build a sprawling society with media matching

40
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:12.710
skyscrapers and Pearl harbors. And then of course,

41
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:16.130
Rick close it all up minus the twin skyscrapers of course.

42
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.040
<v 1>Totally would have been cheap. Yeah, real low-hanging fruit.</v>

43
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.240
We're better than that.

44
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.950
<v 0>Also Jerry has bees.</v>

45
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.520
I think one of the most interesting elements of this episode lies in this small

46
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.590
gag parasite, Rick Glorioso,

47
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.370
two brands against the progressive agenda of living longer. Now at first,

48
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:34.040
this seems like a quick jab at people like Alex Jones.

49
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.890
<v 1>Did I at least sell out and sell fight amens or something?</v>

50
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.770
<v 0>Basic concept is mirrored everywhere in the episode,</v>

51
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.460
that is if something is natural, does that make it right?

52
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.390
Face hugger Rick's argument for the murder suicide of host and parasite is based

53
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:49.100
on quote unquote science.

54
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.050
<v 1>Here's a scientific fact.</v>

55
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.090
I'm not allowed to say our hosts are biologically designed to

56
00:02:56.091 --> 00:03:00.010
incubate our eggs. If that triggers you. Of course, this is.

57
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.970
<v 0>Not actually science. It's the mention of science in a logical fallacy,</v>

58
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.230
the appeal to nature fallacy. That is the idea that if something is natural,

59
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:11.560
it is inherently good desirable or even inevitable.

60
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.790
This kind of fallacy pops up everywhere in the debate about same-sex marriage.

61
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.140
Many people would argue that homosexuality was unnatural and therefore immoral.

62
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.590
Then again, getting mauled by a tiger is perfectly natural,

63
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.820
but that doesn't mean it's good. This is the appeal to nature fallacy inaction.

64
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.290
Others would point to the fact correctly that homosexuality is natural among

65
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.210
many of our closest animal relatives,

66
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.770
which again is still a logical fallacy since dictating where you can or can't

67
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.580
stick your genitals based on what does or doesn't happen in nature is a logical

68
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:46.810
fallacy. This fallacy also pops up around the idea that might is right.

69
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.050
The idea that people are justified to rule by strength alone,

70
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.750
that claim usually gets backed by citing Darwinism,

71
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.950
whatever primates do or don't do in the wild or our evolutionary history of

72
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:57.784
humans being.

73
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.990
Pretty much every time you hear about monkeys primates or our caveman ancestors,

74
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:06.460
you should stop listening to that person except that's a fallacy fallacy

75
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.780
dismissing a conclusion outright because it's logic was flawed. Anyway,

76
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.790
everyone shut up about monkeys already.

77
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.270
Parasite Rick's argument is exactly this kind of appeal to nature.

78
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.140
He says we should deposit our eggs because the host can biologically sustain

79
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:23.920
them. You also has a poster on his wall that displays a kind of might is right.

80
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:28.090
Logic reading that glories, those are Supreme and hosts are subservient,

81
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.480
which echoes plenty of bad appeals to nature found in places like social

82
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:32.170
Darwinism.

83
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.500
The progress of summer on the other hand is about moving past biology,

84
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:36.790
determining one's future.

85
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.960
<v 1>Get the hell out of here and be whatever the we want.</v>

86
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.140
That's evolution that's progress, but there's.

87
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.150
<v 0>More subtle critique going on here important to this episode and life is that</v>

88
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:52.410
people when appealing to nature often set up an arbitrary divide between good

89
00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:53.880
nature and bad nature.

90
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.040
<v 1>Since we were in eggs. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

91
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.890
Now you respect like the biological institutions now.

92
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.120
<v 0>Arguing that same-sex marriage is bad because it's unnatural.</v>

93
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.360
Usually have no problem watching YouTube for eight hours a day,

94
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.590
getting blood transfusions or being temperature regulated by the liquid remains

95
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:12.630
of dinosaurs. Similarly parasite,

96
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.010
Rick has no problem enjoying the unnatural spoils of civilization or non

97
00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:17.730
reproductive.

98
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.930
Arguably incestual face sucking while railing against the repression of

99
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:23.100
biological processes.

100
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.830
<v 1>How come you haven't laid an egg inside this old man? Yeah,</v>

101
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.540
because I do what I want. Similarly.

102
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.220
<v 0>One could respect nature while despising parts of it that seem icky or just</v>

103
00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:33.990
dangerous like snakes,

104
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.290
which have historically been labeled in some cultures as evil incarnate.

105
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.320
And of course there's parasites, which to my knowledge,

106
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.080
don't really have too many positive representations in the media.

107
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.930
It's pretty much a default to think of them as mindless.

108
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.250
<v 1>Hugging parasites.</v>

109
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:50.070
I don't think their society's going to be that hard to navigate an evil.

110
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.993
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.770
We thought you were evil that had a giant tower that Blair

112
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.250
Glorioso is. I know. Should, should we help?

113
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.770
<v 0>Here's where the episode gets really interesting because this looking down on</v>

114
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:07.720
our face huggers is in a weird way. A mirror image of parasite, Rick normal,

115
00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:09.550
Rick views, parasites as lowly,

116
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.000
a lesser form of life as Rick and Morty commit mass murder.

117
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.390
They note how good it feels to cause mayhem without guilt.

118
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.170
<v 1>It feels kind of good when there's no guilt, huh? It's like in star Wars,</v>

119
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.100
just like in star Wars.

120
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.850
<v 0>Comparing it to popping bubble wrap, not destroying an advanced civilization.</v>

121
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.870
<v 1>Oh my God. This is so much fun. I don't want to stop popping. Bubble wrap.</v>

122
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.900
<v 0>Idea is constantly undercut as the show likens,</v>

123
00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:34.240
Rick and Morty's violence to American tragedies.

124
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.220
<v 1>You did a nine 11 almost did a nine 11. We went with a Pearl Harbor.</v>

125
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.020
We're pretty classy. Why were either of those and option 40 even comments?

126
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.700
I should have been a better species.

127
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:46.780
<v 0>Going might is right.</v>

128
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.590
Justification for destroying their world before becoming horrified by his

129
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:51.424
actions.

130
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.650
<v 1>Sorry, I'm sorry.</v>

131
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.630
<v 0>Not all that different than parasite.</v>

132
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.630
Rick's justification for enslaving host species humans,

133
00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:02.050
killing parasites is just some old fashioned natural pest control.

134
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.540
Even if by some unnatural means.

135
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.600
There's also just a really interesting question here that I love.

136
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.100
There's a basic hypothetical.

137
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.570
Is it fair to call a species evil for just reproducing as their nature dictates

138
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.020
what would happen if he encountered an intelligent alien that could only survive

139
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.280
by living parasitically off another Centene Dalian is there even a line in the

140
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:25.270
sand? We can draw as a species that lives off eating other species,

141
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.090
just some food for thought. And before you go,

142
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:31.300
I want to give one final shout out to paradox interactive and their strategy
