<v 0>This episode is brought to you by Ridge wallet.</v>

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.320
<v 1>Hey wisecrack, Jared here,</v>

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.490
you artists have had as big an impact on our image of the apocalypse as

4
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:18.050
Australian director and actually fully trained medical Dr. George Miller

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.980
Miller's vision of a leather clad post-apocalyptic wasteland has captured our

6
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:26.420
collective imagination since the release of mad max, the road warrior in 1981.

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.880
And while we mostly tend to think of mad, max,

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.600
is that franchise with more violent car crashes than lines of dialogue.

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.190
These films hold our attention because they, and indeed most of Miller's work,

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.810
explore big questions around life, death, and power who owns the body.

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.880
And what is it for who gets to decide who lives and who dies and how can we live

12
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.730
full lives? When death is all around us today,

13
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:52.940
we're going to explore George Miller's answers to these questions and more.

14
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.500
So go get some spray paint,

15
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.250
flood your car with gasoline and witness us as we dive straight into this

16
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:02.900
wisecrack edition on the politics of life and death in Madmax and Bay

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.830
and spoils ahead for grown men getting straight up horny over cars.

18
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.660
<v 0>And again also, babe.</v>

19
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.260
<v 1>But before we continue, I want to give a shout out to this week.</v>

38
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.080
First, a little scene setting.

39
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.980
George Miller's mad max universe opens in a near future Australia where

40
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.720
ultraviolet motorcycle gangs,

41
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.780
Duke it out with ultra violent cops for control of the roads.

42
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.980
Protagonist max rocket Tansky's family is murdered in the first film and the

43
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:25.220
series follows him as he wanders the wasteland in the wake of a nuclear

44
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.250
pocalypse, struggling to survive turf Wars between rival group,

45
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.680
while holding onto some shred of his sanity,

46
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.200
to understand a lot of what Miller does in these movies.

47
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.880
We can turn to our old friend and war boy, caus player philosopher, Michel Fuko,

48
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.480
Fuko spent much of his career crafting and refining a concept.

49
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.670
He called biopower in a nutshell,

50
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:48.080
the idea that power in all its forms has increasingly come to bear on life and

51
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:49.310
biological function.

52
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.080
Biopower according to Fuko involves the calculated management of life,

53
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.160
the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations and distributing the

54
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:02.170
living in the domain value and utility in short modern power.

55
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.460
Isn't just about the exercise of force, but building and managing a population.

56
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.910
This management plays a big role in the politics of the wasteland.

57
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.010
Mad max beyond Thunderdome, for instance,

58
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.910
revolves around the fight between auntie entity and masterblaster for control of

59
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:19.720
barter town, a settlement that literally runs on biological activity.

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.530
Specifically the methane produced from pigs and relies on prison,

61
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:28.210
labor to process set feces and in mad max fury road and Wharton Joe uses the

62
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.890
tried and true biopolitical technology of chastity belts to control his wives,

63
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.770
reproductive capacity and hoarded for himself.

64
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.060
But the concept of biopower can only take us so far in our analysis of Miller's

65
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.170
work to go deeper.

66
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:46.000
We have to move past the politics of life and explore the politics of death in

67
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:50.590
his 2003 essay, Negro politics, Cameroonian philosopher, and political theorist,

68
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.760
a shield in Bemba formulated the idea of Niekro power as an update to

69
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.150
[inaudible] concept of biopower. According to members,

70
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.570
much of the world now runs on political machinery that is designed not to

71
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:05.680
protect and control life, but to produce death in vast quantities,

72
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.730
as he explains it,

73
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.440
Negro politics involves the generalized instrumentalization of human existence.

74
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.780
It brings about the creation of death, worlds,

75
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.220
new and unique forms of social existence in which people take on the status of

76
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:22.810
living dead. Obviously even Bemba isn't writing some walking dead fan fiction.

77
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.530
Rather. He means that in a jurisdiction permeated by Negro politics,

78
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:31.030
such as a slave powered plantation or an area subject to colonial rule members

79
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:34.540
of certain groups are allowed to live so long as they are useful,

80
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.350
but denied status as fully sentient human beings with their own rights and

81
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.460
subjectivity.

82
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.260
These people are physically or psychologically named to Mark them as lesser than

83
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.790
in this way. They are kept in what new Ben Beck refers to as a state of injury.

84
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.060
This state of injury is rampant in the world of Madmax.

85
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.780
These movies love to explore the weird and terrifying ways that near future

86
00:04:55.781 --> 00:05:00.370
Australians degrade each other into mere objects in the road warrior a gang

87
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.760
straps,

88
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.510
prisoners to the front of their cars to be used as living hood ornaments,

89
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.460
moreover gang boss, Lord humongous,

90
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.150
arguably even puts his own fighters into a state of injury by classifying them,

91
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:12.000
not as people, but this animals

92
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.350
[inaudible] and in fury road,

93
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:20.010
people are reduced to all kinds of weird objects meant to serve a Morton Joe's

94
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:20.580
needs.

95
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.930
Max is kidnapped and turned into a blood bag and Morton Joe keeps a collection

96
00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:28.320
of lactating women hooked up to an industrial pumping machine to produce

97
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:32.070
mother's milk. And then of course there are Morton Joe's wives,

98
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.320
or as they're known around the Citadel Britas.

99
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.380
<v 2>He's priced breeders in a Morton shows eyes, these women.</v>

100
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.850
<v 1>Our property instrumentalized in,</v>

101
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.800
in bemba's terms to the point where he keeps them behind a literal bank vault

102
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:44.280
door,

103
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.910
as if they were a stash of gold bars or the last remaining copy of final fantasy

104
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:48.540
seven,

105
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.680
he values their lives only in so far as they can make his babies against this

106
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:56.640
Negro political backdrop where a human life is presumed to be a resource.

107
00:05:56.641 --> 00:05:58.370
Rather, an end in itself,

108
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.330
Ben Beck claims that people tend to use one of two basic strategies to find

109
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.980
meaning and make life bearable.

110
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.070
The first and most obvious is the logic of survival.

111
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.760
The approach to life that finds satisfaction in being the last person standing

112
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.140
max embodies this logic throughout the series and explicitly voices it in the

113
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.550
opening shot of fury road.

114
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.170
<v 3>A mountain root juice to a single instinct.</v>

115
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.413
So five.

116
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.800
<v 1>More complex is the logic of martyrdom. The way of thinking that drives suicide,</v>

117
00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:28.300
bombers, kamikaze pilots,

118
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.020
and so on to kill large numbers of people by killing themselves.

119
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.350
According to him, Ben Bev, when the logic of martyrdom is in full swing,

120
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.490
the besieged body becomes a piece of metal whose function is to sacrifice,

121
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.110
to bring eternal life into being this logic finds its fullest expression in the

122
00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:44.980
cult of the V8,

123
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.060
the religion that encourages the war boys to win eternal life by dying in

124
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:51.070
service to a Morton Joe knucks,

125
00:06:51.071 --> 00:06:54.760
for instance deals with his hellish life and impending death by cancer,

126
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.360
who fantasizing about the opportunity to die a glorious death.

127
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.890
<v 3>If I'm going to die, I'm gonna die historic on the fury road.</v>

128
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.000
<v 1>More than anything else.</v>

129
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.090
The dying knucks desires eternity in the form of Valhalla.

130
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.460
<v 3>I die. I'll never forget.</v>

131
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.170
<v 1>When he fails to kill Furiosa.</v>

132
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:15.070
He frames that failure as the loss of his one chance at eternal life.

133
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.730
<v 3>I should be walking with you and mortar visiting with the arrows a full time.</v>

134
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.840
And speaking of McFees thing broke to be a big fat pig.

135
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.480
<v 1>So far we've been discussing how George Miller explores questions around life,</v>

136
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.380
death, sovereignty, and so on through Madmax. But George Miller,

137
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.380
isn't just a former medical doctor who directed the mad max series.

138
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.430
The route his career Miller has been involved in a variety of genres among them,

139
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:42.550
dark fantasy medical drama and children's films,

140
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.440
including believe it or not fave and happy feet weirder still throughout

141
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:51.460
all of these movies, bio politics and Negro politics still loom large,

142
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.190
not convinced allow us to re-introduce to you.

143
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.820
What is arguably the most sexual of penguin base children's movies.

144
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.350
Some might say too sexual.

145
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.550
<v 3>I will retire now to my coach of perpetual indulgence.</v>

146
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.850
Ladies whose first happy feet.

147
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.650
<v 1>Follows the adventures of a mumble,</v>

148
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.820
a penguin born in the midst of a fish shortage to a society organized around the

149
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:13.654
act of singing.

150
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.920
When his father Memphis realizes that mumble wants to dance rather than saying

151
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.203
his deeply.

152
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.570
<v 3>I thought it was kind of cute, but it just ain't penguin. Okay.</v>

153
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.950
<v 1>Emperor land fetishize is singing and identifies it as the only legitimate way</v>

154
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:27.820
to find a mate.

155
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.140
This behavior lines up neatly with Bukos description of the so-called science of

156
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:35.920
sex that developed in conjunction with biopower. For instance,

157
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:39.460
he notes how the strange pleasures of individuals were long considered harmful

158
00:08:39.461 --> 00:08:43.270
to all important population health in contrast, proper normal sex,

159
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.960
allegedly ensured a physically vigorous population. In other words,

160
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:48.700
getting down in a non-traditional way,

161
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:52.390
came to be seen as literally dangerous to the health and safety of your

162
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:54.460
neighbor, your country, et cetera.

163
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.410
It's on these grounds that the community elders attack, mumbles tap dancing.

164
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.460
<v 4>It's just this kind of backsliding. This has brought the scarcity up on us.</v>

165
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.040
<v 1>The emperor penguins, biopolitical logic,</v>

166
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.000
the only safe and healthy way to channel sexual energy is through singing.

167
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.450
Anything else is seen as a direct threat to the wellbeing of the group.

168
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.560
Biopower plays a similar role in Miller's the witches of Eastwick the entire

169
00:09:18.561 --> 00:09:22.250
plot of this dark comedy revolves around a sexual relationship between the devil

170
00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:25.430
and three women who unknowingly summoned him to their conservative new England

171
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:29.630
town. The townsfolk condemned their behavior as not just immoral but dangerous.

172
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.160
<v 4>Yeah. Oh, that is everybody.</v>

173
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:35.961
<v 1>Morton.</v>

174
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:39.650
Joe Jack Nicholson's devil ultimately seeks to use the women in his life as

175
00:09:39.651 --> 00:09:44.260
vessels for his offspring of fact recognized only by the hilariously unhinged

176
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.100
about churchgoer Felicia who slowly loses her mind, imagining the sinful stupid.

177
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.563
<v 4>He'll probably get,</v>

178
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.950
he will increase this number.

179
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.710
<v 1>Miller's non Madmax projects.</v>

180
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.580
Also engage heavily with Niekro power by exploring questions around who lives

181
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:04.460
and who dies and why nominal kids movie,

182
00:10:04.461 --> 00:10:08.750
babe explores the state of injury through the lens of life on a farm from the

183
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.201
get-go.

184
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:13.340
The actually horrifying film makes it clear that the farm animals lives depend

185
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:15.800
on their ability to provide utility to the Huggins.

186
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.820
Or as member might say their lives depend on how they can instrumentalize

187
00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:22.640
themselves if they can't do that while alive. Well,

188
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.360
there's always dinner to think about like the population of the Citadel.

189
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:30.350
The animals are grouped into a rough cast system based on the role they play on

190
00:10:30.351 --> 00:10:33.770
the farm. The exact mechanics of this divide are spelled out by Ferdinand,

191
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.250
a duck who tries to steal the morning crowing responsibilities in order to

192
00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:38.630
become indispensable to the house.

193
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.590
<v 4>Humans don't eat cats. Why indispensable?</v>

194
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.600
They catch mice humans don't eat boosters.

195
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.810
Why they make eggs with the hand to wake everyone up in the morning,

196
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.130
animals lower in the hierarchy.

197
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.880
<v 1>Are kept in a state of injury where they are reduced to the food items that they</v>

198
00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:54.020
are destined to become.

199
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.120
<v 4>You are.</v>

200
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.900
<v 1>The tragedy of the Negro political arrangement is that it gives the half lives,</v>

201
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.950
pork chops and blood bags of the world. Only one way to experience something,

202
00:11:03.951 --> 00:11:08.510
approaching personhood to deal out death and violence themselves at this point

203
00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:10.580
is subtler in babe than in Madmax.

204
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.270
The pig only gets as far as biting a sheep on the leg, but we can dream can't.

205
00:11:14.271 --> 00:11:17.150
We, when Ben Beck claims that under Negro politics,

206
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.500
a person becomes a subject that is a fully individually to human being in the

207
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:25.490
struggle and the work for which he or she confronts death and upholding the work

208
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.840
of death. In other words,

209
00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:30.200
the extent to which you are allowed to be a unique person is determined by how

210
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:32.300
much killing you can do. If you're a victim,

211
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.210
you don't matter throughout the mad max franchise.

212
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:39.350
The right to define oneself is limited mainly to men and occasional woman who

213
00:11:39.351 --> 00:11:42.590
have the power and the will to subject others, to violence and death.

214
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.970
Employing flamboyant costumes and monologues characters distinguish themselves

215
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:51.260
from the draft multitudes by killing effectively and with a particular sense of

216
00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:52.094
style.

217
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.650
As a member out murder in a Negro political environment tends to become over the

218
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:59.950
top, even perversely playful in the wasteland,

219
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.820
it helps to be a bit of a ham toe cutter and his gang in particular,

220
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:07.810
the ill-fated Nightrider demonstrate the link between killing and personhood

221
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.110
using violence and chaos as opportunities for [inaudible].

222
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.200
<v 3>Uh, no, not right.</v>

223
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.560
I'm a fuel injected suicide machine.

224
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.260
<v 1>The speeches and Cod pieces get bigger in the road warrior with humongous</v>

225
00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:33.600
employing what appears to be a full-time hype.

226
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.153
<v 3>No worries.</v>

227
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.470
<v 1>And the trend continues through fury road with next feeling most like a person</v>

228
00:12:46.471 --> 00:12:48.600
when attempting a suicide run on the war room.

229
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.703
<v 3>I don't know that.</v>

230
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.181
<v 1>Not to be outdone.</v>

231
00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:00.450
The bullet farmer responds to the loss of his eye with a speedy personal

232
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.463
reasons.

233
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.863
<v 3>Just that.</v>

234
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.070
<v 1>Strikingly max actually avoids defining himself in terms of his violent deeds.</v>

235
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.100
<v 3>What do I call you? Does it matter?</v>

236
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:14.940
<v 1>Max,</v>

237
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.420
in other words has been so warped by his time in the wasteland and by the logic

238
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:22.530
of survival that he doesn't even want an identity to take a name after all is to

239
00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:26.790
make a kind of stand a liability for a person who just wants to drive away from

240
00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:30.960
trouble as far and as fast as he can. And yet,

241
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:34.290
for a guy who makes movies about sexual assault, suicide bombings,

242
00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:35.370
and horny penguins,

243
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.670
George Miller injects his stories with a surprising amount of hope,

244
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.240
hot up in cruel biopolitical and Negro political systems.

245
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.350
His protagonists ultimately find ways to transcend those systems and live in

246
00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:49.500
ways that leave the world better than they found it. In other words,

247
00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:53.490
they find the redemption that max and Furiosa are looking for and in the process

248
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.600
becomes subjects without resorting to pointless killing just before the world

249
00:13:57.601 --> 00:14:02.160
goes completely to a pre wasteland. Max expresses his fear of losing himself.

250
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.570
Should he spend too much time on the.

251
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.530
<v 3>I'm scared? You know why</v>

252
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.030
I'm beginning to enjoy water spotty week, any longer out on that road.

253
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:17.790
And I'm one of them, you know, the terminal crazy.

254
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.540
<v 1>Which of course is exactly what happens. Max loses his family,</v>

255
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.990
takes revenge on tow cutters gang and begins his dissent to the condition.

256
00:14:24.991 --> 00:14:26.850
We find him in at the beginning of furious.

257
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.870
<v 3>Road, root juice to a single instinct.</v>

258
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.293
So five.

259
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.170
<v 1>Beginning with the road warrior Miller challenges us to imagine a way back for</v>

260
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.570
max. That is a way for him to live again.

261
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.720
<v 3>A man haunted by the DV,</v>

262
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.330
a man had wandered out into the wasteland.

263
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.310
<v 1>The way to live. Again.</v>

264
00:14:50.311 --> 00:14:54.080
It turns out to fight back against the logics of Negro politics,

265
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.790
namely survival and martyrdom to take actions that put one's own life at risk

266
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:02.420
and have some greater purpose beyond taking as many possible people with you.

267
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:03.254
When you die.

268
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.070
Bade finds out how to live in a Negro political environment by learning to herd

269
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:11.600
sheep with kindness rather than cruelty after his one attempt at being an to the

270
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:13.130
sheep, fails to get him any results.

271
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.830
Bade commits to simply asking them nicely to move.

272
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.750
<v 3>No need for all this Wolf nonsense. Yulman all a nice little pig.</v>

273
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.793
Like you need do his.

274
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.040
<v 1>With this radical new approach. Bade creates for himself,</v>

275
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.190
a form of subjectivity, not bound to the cycle of dominance,

276
00:15:27.191 --> 00:15:31.780
which fly describes earlier in the film. He is neither a pork chop nor a Wolf.

277
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.470
As the terrified sheep called the violent dogs. He is the sheep pig.

278
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.930
This dynamic of taking a riskier,

279
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.690
less efficient action for the benefit of friends,

280
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.890
rather than the destruction of enemies is also key to the redemption in fury

281
00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:46.690
road. In his final moments,

282
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.500
knucks transcends the normal logic of martyrdom by turning his body into a

283
00:15:50.501 --> 00:15:54.250
shield that saves his friends rather than a weapon to be used against his

284
00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:56.980
enemies. He gives us life, not out of hatred for the other,

285
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.200
but out of love for the first people in his life.

286
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.320
Who've recognized him as anything more than a fanatical soldier.

287
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.380
As he crashes the rig,

288
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.100
blocking the past and allowing the others time to escape his new friends,

289
00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:12.010
become the first people to truly honor his request,

290
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:16.020
to witness him driving away and gracing him with the same hand sign to Buddha.

291
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.720
Leni used to honor their dead. They recognize him as the full person.

292
00:16:19.721 --> 00:16:23.650
He could never become as long as he worshiped in Morton. Jo. Similarly,

293
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:27.910
max becomes a subject by transcending the logic of survival rather than taking

294
00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:30.760
the motorcycle offered to him and driving far, far away,

295
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.810
he can Cox a wild plan to drive straight back the way they came through in

296
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:38.830
Morton Joe's forces to take the Citadel for themselves. In other words,

297
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:39.790
max risks,

298
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:43.300
his own life for the chance to create a better life for the people he's come to

299
00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:44.134
care about.

300
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.190
This allows him to become a subject outside of the Negro political framework to

301
00:16:48.191 --> 00:16:49.150
reclaim his.

302
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.100
<v 3>Name. My name is max.</v>

303
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.070
<v 1>Now none of these endings are quite that simple. At the end of the day.</v>

304
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.370
Baby is still an unpaid farm labor who could be turned into spare ribs.

305
00:16:57.371 --> 00:17:01.000
The moment he stops being useful and Furiosa and company find themselves in

306
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:02.920
control of a massive war machine.

307
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.520
It'll take a lot of work to deprogram a Citadel full of war pups,

308
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.210
but at a minimum Miller offers us hope that in a world too often,

309
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:12.070
colluded by coercion and violence,

310
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.630
we can find a way to be something other than victims or perpetrators as Max's

311
00:17:16.631 --> 00:17:18.370
one-time commanding officer puts it.

312
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.480
<v 3>Oh. Then you won't be Mac</v>

313
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:28.570
give a bad day.

314
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.580
<v 1>Babe.</v>

315
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.810
Max Furiosa and Knox all proved themselves to be bigger than the labels put on

316
00:17:34.811 --> 00:17:38.560
them by the Negro political power structure. Babe is a sheep pig,

317
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.090
not a pork chop. Furiosa is a freedom fighter, not an imperator.

318
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.820
Knucks is a Loverboy, not a war boy.

319
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.150
And max is more than a man reduced to a single instinct.

320
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.670
He's a human and as hard as that can be sometimes. So are we,

321
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.010
but what do you think wisecrack?

322
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.580
Where can you see biopower and Negro power at work in our world today?

323
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.880
What are some of your favorite stories that grapple with these and similar

324
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:03.660
