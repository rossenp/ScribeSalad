<v 0>This video is brought to you by Ray con</v>

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.080
What's up wisecrack, Michael here.

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.250
A lot of you have been very puzzled for a very long time on why wisecrack

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.810
composed of many Dan Harmon fans have not covered the other show he made,

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.630
you know, the one without the intergalactically drunk scientist,

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.550
like our favorite grandfather,

7
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:26.600
grandson duo community gets extremely meta on everything from Han solo.

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.600
<v 2>I know, but I'm calling dibs on the Han solo role before Jeff slouches into it.</v>

9
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:30.434
By default to film.

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.470
<v 0>God complexes to the very part of the show itself.</v>

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.280
<v 2>He came back. Would that change your disposition? Sure.</v>

12
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.570
It could get us back on formula, but I don't see it turning us around.

13
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.950
<v 0>But while one might dismiss the overabundance of references as some weird flex</v>

14
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:43.910
by the writers room,

15
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.810
I want to suggest that something else is going on the show is trying to tell you

16
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.070
yes, you, that you're much smarter than network television thinks you are.

17
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.840
So how does community manage to do that while also managing to be incredibly

18
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:57.920
irreverent and silly?

19
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.120
Let's find out in this wisecrack edition on the philosophy of community and

20
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:06.230
spoilers ahead for community. And before we get into it,

21
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.380
I want to give a huge shout out to Ray Khan for sponsoring this video.

22
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.440
I only come to the studio once a week for an hour or two to shoot,

23
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.460
which means I spend most of my time home in my apartment with my fiance during

24
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.910
the Workday. I need to watch certain shows for research, of course,

25
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.690
or listen to music. And I just don't want to disturb anyone else.

26
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.260
Rake on ear buds had been the perfect solution. They are comfortable,

27
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.560
discreet and sound just as good as any other premium brand on the market.

28
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.380
They offer six hours of playtime, seamless, Bluetooth pairing,

29
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:36.920
more base in a compact design for a comfortable noise, isolating fit.

30
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.730
They also come in a variety of colors and styles. So check them out today.

31
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.750

37
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.570
community follows Jeff winger,

38
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:05.930
a disgraced lawyer who has to attend a lowly community college in hopes of

39
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.010
getting back to the courtroom.

40
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.220
<v 2>The state bar has suspended my license. Uh,</v>

41
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.130
they found out my college degree was less than.

42
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.450
<v 0>Legitimate in the process.</v>

43
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:17.990
He becomes friends with a study group full of truly bizarre characters.

44
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.320
The phrase cult classic. It gets thrown around a lot these days,

45
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.780
almost as much as the phrase classic cult,

46
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.690
which is often used to describe heaven's Gates, Jonestown,

47
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:28.430
and people who still watch American idol.

48
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.110
But I digress community is one of the few sitcoms that absolutely deserves this

49
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:33.944
distinction.

50
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.730
It's a show so beloved that its fans basically saved it from extinction twice.

51
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.280
The creator has his own mythos and documentary,

52
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.680
and it remains a part of the cultural conversation.

53
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:47.060
Half a decade later with that long awaited movie, maybe still on the way.

54
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.420
One of the reasons for the status is the show's use of references,

55
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.670
which are intricately layered upon each other.

56
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.070
<v 2>It was about reinvented ourselves over the summer,</v>

57
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.880
a little late to the hipster party, much, a little much on the much, much.

58
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.970
<v 0>It also makes us in a healthy dose of self-awareness like the bottle episode in</v>

59
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:06.070
which Ahmed constantly reminds everyone.

60
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.200
<v 2>That does it starting to feel like a bottle episode.</v>

61
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.110
<v 0>And this is obviously all really fun, but what if,</v>

62
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.420
and it's over the top use of tropes and references.

63
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.110
The show gives us a unique way to explore the meaning of pop culture and our

64
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.010
relationship with it.

65
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.820
If we want to get a deeper understanding of why clip shows featuring things that

66
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.300
never happened, or a loving fear of LaVar Burton. So.

67
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.910
<v 2>Do you go to school nearby.</v>

68
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.850
<v 0>Are actually commentaries on us and how we relate to the media.</v>

69
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.630
We have to look at a thing called Epic theater or interventionist theater.

70
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.050
Epic theater was a style developed by playwright, Bertolt Brecht.

71
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.250
If regular plays wanted people to leave feeling relieved that the hero saved the

72
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:47.700
day Brecht wanted them to leave the theater feeling very confused.

73
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.120
He was living in an era in which people were consuming, lots of theater,

74
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.030
but the purpose of this theater was to provide entertainment,

75
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.570
not to make people think about themselves and their place in society.

76
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.740
With Epic theater,

77
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.520
he aimed to shift the arts purpose and hopes of broadening its boundaries and

78
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:06.990
giving it a social function. Brecht criticized arts traditionalist tendencies,

79
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.010
which he thought led to a constant repetition of the same stories and creative

80
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.250
forms. So rather than appealing to the audience's hearts,

81
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:15.330
like most art of his time,

82
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.140
he sought to speak to their minds that meant using both songs,

83
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:23.100
placards and projections of ideas onto the stage to hammer home the meaning he

84
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:25.380
wanted the audience to get these plays.

85
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.260
Weren't subtle works using subtext to convey ideas.

86
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.560
They were intellectual works that put the ideas front and center.

87
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.230
So if he were alive circuit 2009,

88
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.100
he probably would have been sick of all the multicam network sitcoms that

89
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:42.060
recycled the same themes over and over without ever shaking things up or

90
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:44.460
exploring challenging ideas. Of course,

91
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.840
Dan Harmon has always seemed similarly bored with traditional sitcom tropes from

92
00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:51.600
his early days of heat vision and Jack into community.

93
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:55.350
And up through the modern reign of Rick and Morty Harmon has pushed against TV's

94
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:57.690
tendency to simply repeat what's worked in the past.

95
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.470
And this means that rather than recycling the same tropes that we're used to.

96
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.460
So that watching television is a pacifying experience where our body melds with

97
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:08.730
the couch and our mind melds with the screen and our mouth belts to the bowl of

98
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:12.450
pizza rolls covered in CAISO Harmon wants to disrupt our assumptions.

99
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.440
And he does so by subverting criticizing and sometimes just straight blowing up

100
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.730
classic sitcom tropes.

101
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.390
Occasionally that means using the spiritual perfection of chicken fingers to

102
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:25.320
explore the dynamics of mafia films and the divine silliness of mafia, cosplay.

103
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.030
<v 2>To us lines are for suckers hacks sheep. We were wolves.</v>

104
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.100
We had the chicken approval.

105
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.520
<v 0>Sometimes it means using a pulp fiction episode to actually do a,</v>

106
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:36.960
my dinner with Andre episode.

107
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.600
That explores how we can use film to make human connections.

108
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.660
<v 2>I chose my dinner with Andre because it's about a guy who has an unexpectedly</v>

109
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:44.790
enjoyable evening with a weird friend he's been avoiding.

110
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.620
<v 0>But in both cases,</v>

111
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.910
the show is simultaneously having fun with classic film tropes while also

112
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:54.360
getting us to reflect on what happens when we can only make sense of our lives

113
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:56.490
through the framework of these tropes. Indeed,

114
00:05:56.491 --> 00:06:00.170
many of the groups best antics are the result of their inability to think

115
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:04.310
outside of the rigid box of pop culture. When faced with a basic problem,

116
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.200
the dining hall running out of chicken fingers,

117
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.440
they turn to cultural tropes for their solution. In this case,

118
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:13.310
that means going full Goodfellas and tearing the group apart in the process.

119
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.270
<v 3>I don't believe what greedy sellouts you people turned out to be.</v>

120
00:06:16.271 --> 00:06:18.790
I'm not going to stand here and be ignored.

121
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.290
<v 0>In a less frivolous example.</v>

122
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.920
I've had dinner with Andre occurs when he can't conceive of what a standard

123
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:27.100
adult dinner would look like outside of a film reference here,

124
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.910
even as attempted normalcy is completely mediated by a work of cinematic

125
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:31.630
fiction.

126
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.390
<v 4>All right, so you're ending early because in my dinner with Andre,</v>

127
00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:35.224
the waiter brings.

128
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.710
<v 0>The show constantly encourages us to think critically about what we're willing</v>

129
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:42.670
to accept as entertainment and why we're content to watch the same tropes play

130
00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:46.540
out over and over again. We see this in the freaky Friday episode.

131
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.150
<v 4>If you're worried about Abbott, you should talk to him, right?</v>

132
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.040
I should talk to him.

133
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.310
<v 0>And which Troy and I buy a six pack of body switching movies.</v>

134
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.420
This of course makes you think how in the hell is this idea of,

135
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.290
and recycled six different times.

136
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.600
<v 4>13 Going on 30 17, again, 18, again, vice-versa freaky Friday.</v>

137
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.250
<v 0>But not content to merely roast a tired trope community uses this trope to</v>

138
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:13.210
create an oddly sweet breakup for Troy and Britta while also bucking against the

139
00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:15.100
inanities of standard sit-com breakups.

140
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.890
<v 4>Wait, are you breaking up with me?</v>

141
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.560
<v 0>I think so one of the shows underlying arguments seems to be that the reason</v>

142
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.830
we're served the same slop over and over is that we keep coming back to the

143
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:31.120
trough without any complaints case in point been in Troy's obsession with the

144
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:33.070
fictional kick puncher film franchise,

145
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.520
which is clearly a parody of the way the action genre recycles the same

146
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:40.630
formulaic tropes over and over again. But through this ongoing bit,

147
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:42.910
we can also see if we're willing to be introspective.

148
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.910
How often we too are just like Troy and Abbot,

149
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.510
letting ourselves fall prey to crappy recycled movies because of the hype.

150
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.390
It's a version of what Brecht was doing with his interventionist style,

151
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.330
making the audience reflect on themselves.

152
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.440
So sure community might not have the same grand ambitions that Brecht had to

153
00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:02.230
change theater so that theater in time could change the world.

154
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.430
But it does seem to have a clear mission to use its extreme mechanism to make

155
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:09.640
you rethink your own expectations about contemporary media.

156
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.590
And we think Harmon's breakfast.

157
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.490
TV goes deeper than just breaking the fourth wall and offering meta commentary

158
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:16.810
about culture. See,

159
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.470
one thing that was really important to Brett was making sure his audience was

160
00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:21.370
always aware.

161
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:24.790
They were watching a play rather than letting them get too caught up in the

162
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:26.260
action. Similarly,

163
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.860
community never wants you to forget that you're just watching a TV show.

164
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.030
This approach was and remains striking because most entertainment has the

165
00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:35.500
opposite aim, namely,

166
00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:39.370
to make us get so caught up in what we're watching that we momentarily forget.

167
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:43.090
It's just a performance. This is called the suspension of disbelief,

168
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.060
which means that the audience accepts fiction as reality.

169
00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:50.530
So as to experience the story as real Recht wanted his audience to avoid the

170
00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:54.100
suspension and he did so by having actors purposely deliver their lines

171
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:54.641
awkwardly,

172
00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:59.010
or even speak directly to the audience community's version of this similarly

173
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:01.530
breaks, or at least alludes to breaking the fourth wall.

174
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.860
This is accomplished largely via op-ed commenting on the audio.

175
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.770
<v 2>I use the ballot, starting everyone by popularity,</v>

176
00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:08.360
and I put the most popular with least popular.

177
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.700
I figured it would maximize each partnership's audience appeal.

178
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.440
<v 0>The more subtly via characters,</v>

179
00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:14.630
discussing plot dynamics and seasons and character.

180
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.960
<v 2>We'll definitely be back next year. If not,</v>

181
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.650
it'll be because an asteroid has destroyed all human civilization and that's

182
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.160
Canada.

183
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.560
<v 0>Oh, and Ahmed also plays a cartoon character,</v>

184
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.570
literally named fourth wall subtle by refusing to let us suspend our televisual

185
00:09:29.571 --> 00:09:33.560
disbelief community deflates the significance of standard sitcom tropes.

186
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.420
For example, and friends,

187
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.530
there is an audience expectation that Rachel and Ross just had to get together

188
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:42.770
for the show to make sense similarly, and how I met your mother.

189
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.520
The show had to jump through some wild hoops to make sure that Ted and Robin

190
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:47.354
ended up together.

191
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.560
Examples like this dominate modern television and are basically a prerequisite

192
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:55.220
for having a multi-season run watching community for the first time,

193
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.430
it's a reasonable to expect a romantic payoff between our cocky,

194
00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:02.210
attractive protagonists, Jeff, and the edgy attractive loner Brita.

195
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.140
But because of the spirit of Brett lives on inside the troubled bowels of Dan

196
00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:08.990
Harmon, they get together for a bit and then they split up.

197
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.820
You want to stop doing this? Yeah.

198
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.640
And then she dates another member of the gang and then they split up.

199
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.040
And at the end of the day, none of it matters.

200
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.440
<v 2>Somebody is sure working our way around the table.</v>

201
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.670
<v 0>By doing this community. Isn't saying, see, we're not like those other shows.</v>

202
00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:23.504
We're different.

203
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.320
Rather it's challenging the audience to rethink our assumptions about modern

204
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:29.000
media and how we consume it.

205
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.900
Like why do we immediately expect that the relationship between the two

206
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.020
good-looking people in the pilot will romantically drive the show?

207
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.860
And what does it say about us? And is it a bad thing? See,

208
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:43.850
it's not just that film and television has created a deep expectation that any

209
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:48.760
two onscreen stone-cold hotties are eventually inevitably going bang it's that

210
00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:51.080
this assumption bleeds into our real lives,

211
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.860
leading us to assume that meat world friendships and romantic relationships will

212
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:57.380
also work like the ones we see on screen.

213
00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.660
Because while we might think that we're like,

214
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.590
op-eds slowly falling in love with a mystery woman who is hearing impaired,

215
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.170
we're more likely just reading way too much into a friend,

216
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:10.310
messing with us to prove a point also like outlet and in more ways than just

217
00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:10.820
this,

218
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.450
the character of our bed is really just an exploration of what happens when we

219
00:11:14.451 --> 00:11:17.810
interpret our whole lives through the matrix of film and television.

220
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.910
And while it's funny, when Ahmed does it,

221
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.050
the show often forces us to face up to how dark and lonely this can actually

222
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:27.200
make our lives. Take the Claymation Christmas episode,

223
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.130
which uses comforting holiday movie imagery to explore ombuds and ability to

224
00:11:31.131 --> 00:11:32.990
cope with real life. Family drama.

225
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.760
<v 2>Take care of dad, wash your Dupa.</v>

226
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.100
Mommy's moved on new family, new life.

227
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.660
<v 0>His insistence on real life.</v>

228
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.260
Following a wholesome family filled narrative makes them unable to deal with the

229
00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:51.710
reality that his mother has moved on and now spends the holidays with her new

230
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:52.490
family.

231
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.600
Or that time gets set up with two blind dates to the Sadie Hawkins dance.

232
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.260
Why don't we.

233
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.190
<v 2>Pick good girl? And then let Abby decide instead of making it a competition,</v>

234
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.420
that's exactly a competition.

235
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.630
<v 0>Commitment to the guy on two dates at one stroke. Don't you already.</v>

236
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.940
<v 2>I have a date to the dance. Yep. Now I have to,</v>

237
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.790
which means I can do the classic two dates in one night sitcom trope,

238
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.850
I'll get to wear two outfits, mix up their names, maybe hide under a table.

239
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.790
<v 0>Leads him to miss out on the fact that Brie Larson or, you know,</v>

240
00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:18.540
a character played by Brie Larson actually likes him that his friendship with

241
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:20.070
Troy follows a similar pattern.

242
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.880
He struggles to deal with his buddy leaving to explore the world by boat with

243
00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:25.050
the host of reading rainbow.

244
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.560
So instead of enjoying the last movie night and wishing him well,

245
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.730
he constructs a wildly intense game of hot lava to process his emotions.

246
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.960
He can only deal with a dramatic change once the two friends both die and come

247
00:12:36.961 --> 00:12:38.040
back as clones.

248
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.250
<v 2>I'm not an exact replication. I have all of our visibilities and memories,</v>

249
00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:42.690
but I'm missing as wild emotionality.

250
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.750
Although I think I may be able to actually go now.

251
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.680
<v 0>Much of the series. I bet behavior. Isn't really challenged,</v>

252
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:53.970
at least not explicitly,

253
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.690
but with the introduction of the gruff criminology professor buzz Hickey and

254
00:12:57.691 --> 00:13:01.860
season five, this show gives him a bit of tough love, initiate ballistic.

255
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.610
<v 5>Oops, what the hell? Sorry. You just destroyed.</v>

256
00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:12.780
Five hours of work.

257
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.100
<v 0>Was avid to acknowledge that he's using these structures and tricks of cinematic</v>

258
00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:18.630
storytelling to make sense of it.

259
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.270
<v 2>Life. I know all the tricks and tropes of filmmaking,</v>

260
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.420
but what I'm missing is what I think the critics call substance, but.

261
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.613
<v 0>There is a problem.</v>

262
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.640
I bed structure over substance problem can be taken as a broader critique.

263
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.780
It asks what happens when our whole lives are mediated via the narratives we

264
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.570
learned from the media. Sure. We know all the tropes,

265
00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:40.080
the plot twist the emotional monologues and the heartwarming conclusions,

266
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.250
but does any of this help navigate our real lives away from the screen?

267
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.720
This seems to be the ultimate Brechtian challenge offered to us by community to

268
00:13:48.721 --> 00:13:52.170
realize that maybe some of the problems in our lives are caused at least

269
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:55.290
partially by our internalization of the media we consume.

270
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.220
And to realize that the media will keep feeding us this type of thing,

271
00:13:59.221 --> 00:14:01.200
because it thinks that's all we're capable of.

272
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.160
But like the study group we're actually smarter than the TV thinks we are.

273
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.400
As a result, community is able to call both the audiences.

274
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:12.240
Assumptions in the media is recycled tropes into question and by doing so,

275
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.320
just like Brex theater,

276
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.220
it just might be making us a little more critically engaged and aware.

277
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.450
So next time someone asks you who your favorite early 20th century German

278
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:24.570
experimental playwright is just scream, Dan Harmon,

279
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.150
and then run away before they can call it into question.

280
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.540
But what do you guys think is Dan Harmon, the new Bertolt Brecht?

281
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.790
Are we all a little bit like Abbot,

282
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.820
let us know in the comments hit that subscribe button,

283
00:14:35.821 --> 00:14:39.540
like you're using the last of your paintballs to defeat your rival college and

284
00:14:39.541 --> 00:14:42.960
ring that bell. Like it's time for anthropology. One Oh one with John Oliver.

285
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.530
Huge. Thanks to our patrons for all your support and as always,

286
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.150
thanks for watching later.
