00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.100
<v 0>What's up wisecrack Michael again. So I'm just going to come out and say it.</v>

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.760
Sometimes I pined for my awkward teen years in the early two thousands,

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.480
it was a simpler time. If you will, a time when frosted tips were cool,

4
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.530
a cop wouldn't kill you.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.160
And the words murder and Hornet never appeared in a sentence together.

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.990
And perhaps most importantly,

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.950
it was a time before Disney and JJ Abrams got their hands on star Wars.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.490
Now that's not to say George Lucas hit it out of the park a hundred percent of

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:31.050
the time, because well, he didn't.

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.370
But despite the constant pre-qual bashing,

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.510
I have a certain fondness for episode three. Sure. It's not perfect,

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.010
but it truly strove for greatness like Greek drama greatness complete with

13
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.050
larger than life characters, ancient prophecies,

14
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.980
and a lot of severed hands just in a galaxy far, far away.

15
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.740
And while the film is certainly no masterpiece,

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.700
it can actually teach us a lot about one of literature's most demanding John was

17
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.080
graduating. So join me for this wisecrack edition on star Wars, episode three,

18
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.020
crafting a tragedy and spoilers ahead.

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.420
Before we dive deeper into star Wars,

20
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.000
I wanted to let you guys know that if you were itching from our wisecrack

21
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.170
content, we have two podcasts that currently run all year long. First,

22
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.400
every other Friday,

23
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:17.250
you have shown me the meaning hosted by your favorite redhead,

24
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.550
where the crew discusses the philosophy and deeper meaning of all your favorite

25
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:21.384
films.

26
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.840
They've covered everything from the matrix of Django and chain to mean girls and

27
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.200
cats. Then every other Wednesday, wisecrack writer,

28
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:29.460
Alec and widespread researcher,

29
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.540
Serbia joined me and exploring the weird depths of the internet and society and

30
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:34.374
culture of binge.

31
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.010
You can find links to our shows in the video description to make things even

32
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.430
easier. You can watch the video version of the strains on our YouTube channel,

33
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.630
youtube.com/wise cast. Check them out and leave a comment.

34
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.710
You may just end up on the pod. Now back to the show. First,

35
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.640
a quick refresher after a separatist movement leaves the galactic Republic

36
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.920
embroiled in war chancellor, Palpatine,

37
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:58.590
the de facto head of the Republic ending not so secret.

38
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.970
Sith Lord gets folk captured by general grievous and the separatists obiwan and

39
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:05.310
Anna can make a desperate bid to free the chancellor,

40
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.420
which leads to more severed hands and one murder count when they return home

41
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.280
anagen receives a hero's welcome,

42
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.820
whereas that his wife is pregnant and then gets appointed to the Jedi council.

43
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.230
All's well, that ends well, right?

44
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.190
Not quite as the clone Wars draw to a close chancellor,

45
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.220
Palpatine solidifies his power in the Senate and the Jedi council grows

46
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:26.400
distrustful of antiquing friendship with them worse. And it can,

47
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:30.090
is played by prophetic dreams of Padma dying dreams that Palpatine.

48
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.950
<v 1>Yeah, I had such a knowledge of the dark side.</v>

49
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.690
He could even keep the ones he cared about

50
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.820
from dying.

51
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.270
<v 0>Well, Anacon initially snitches on the chancellor for being a Sith.</v>

52
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.410
The young Skywalker eventually betrays the Jedi council and hopes of saving

53
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:51.140
Padma Palpatine. Then executes the infamous order,

54
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:53.450
66 to exterminate all the Jedi.

55
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.630
<v 1>Execute all the 66.</v>

56
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.630
<v 0>And turns the galactic Republic into galactic empire bestowing upon us.</v>

57
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.580
One of our all time. Favorite memes,

58
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.000
The film concludes with antique and spiraling into darkness,

59
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:16.290
killing innocent children and forge choking Padma before facing obiwan in one

60
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:20.310
final Epic fight. The rest is history and it can is defeated.

61
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.850
Padma dies in childbirth and Darth Vader. As we know him is born.

62
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

63
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.220
<v 0>I to understand how George Lucas crafted a modern tragedy out of episode three</v>

64
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:34.380
and how it felt just short of greatness.

65
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.770
We first have to look at the genre itself in his book,

66
00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:42.450
poetics Aristotle defines a tragedy as a story about one rate individual who

67
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:45.630
experiences a reversal of fortune, thereby evoking, pity,

68
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:47.580
or fear in the audience. And yes,

69
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:52.020
episode three checks all these boxes and can thought to be the child of prophecy

70
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:55.830
and destined for greatness falls to the dark side and destroys everything he

71
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:58.350
loved. We feel bad for him. It's not.

72
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.120
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

73
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.880
<v 0>Want to get into the real nuts and bolts of the tragedy when you don't where a</v>

74
00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:11.580
structural definition of the term literary critic,

75
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.750
Christopher Booker offers this definition of tragedy in his absolute brick of a

76
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760
text. The seven basic plots,

77
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.870
a tragedy is the story of a hero being tempted or impelled into a course of

78
00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:23.010
action, which is in some way,

79
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:26.550
dark or forbidden for a time as the hero embarks on her course,

80
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.670
he enjoys almost unbelievable dreamlike success,

81
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.320
but somehow the original dream has soured into a nightmare where everything is

82
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:38.190
going more and more wrong. This eventually culminates in the heroes,

83
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.120
violent destruction to Booker this arc from temptation to destruction,

84
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:46.650
spans five simple steps. Importantly, we see aniguns arc and episode three,

85
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:50.400
match this structure. Step first step, we start with stage one,

86
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.720
the anticipation stage.

87
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.960
This is the start of our journey where we find our tragic hero,

88
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.940
unfulfilled and dreaming of greater things.

89
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.360
As Booker as quick to point out this isn't all that different from how our

90
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:04.890
traditional non tragic heroes start their stories and non tragic episode four.

91
00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:05.724
For example,

92
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.780
we opened with a simple farmhand dreaming of adventure and episode three,

93
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:13.920
we opened with a dissatisfied hero who feels stifled by his superiors as a

94
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:16.290
result he's pathologically reckless

95
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.180
And the first battle he disobeyed his orders and tries to shoot off the drones,

96
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:27.780
swarming Obi-Wan ship. Then in a true hold my shotgun moment,

97
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.140
and it can tries to use his own ship to scoop them off. Of course,

98
00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:33.420
we will learn that Anna can only take such dumb,

99
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:35.910
dumb risks in order to save his loved ones,

100
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.320
but there's a darker component to this and it can has ambition. He wants power.

101
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.450
We see this in a showdown with count Duku.

102
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.723
<v 2>Anger.</v>

103
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.460
<v 0>And this is what sets the tragic hero apart from our traditional hero,</v>

104
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.650
instead of answering your typical call to adventure like Luke answering Leah's

105
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.010
distress signal, the tragic hero answers a different call,

106
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.510
the call to temptation.

107
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.470
We see Anna can answer this call when he listens to chancellor Palpatine and

108
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.580
kills count, Duku.

109
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.880
<v 2>Go kill him.</v>

110
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.020
<v 0>It fills us with dress. This is the first step in Anna Ken's fall.</v>

111
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.000
He's given into his desire for power here. The temptations of the Sith, Trump,

112
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:27.940
the teachings of the Jetta. This brings us to stage two.

113
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.080
The dream stage Booker defines the dream stage as the point where the tragic

114
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:36.640
hero, but comes in some way committed to his course of action. And for a while,

115
00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:40.990
things go almost improbably well for the hero he is winning the gratification.

116
00:06:40.991 --> 00:06:44.410
He had dreamed up and seems to be getting away with it for Anik.

117
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.010
And this means getting exactly what he wants. He's become a hero.

118
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:51.790
His new bestie Palpatine is back in power and he scores a seat on the Jedi

119
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.690
council. Of course not. Everyone is happy with these developments,

120
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.910
particularly Anik and fellow Jetta,

121
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.110
but our young Skywalker just doesn't care so long as he can save. Padma,

122
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.140
Booker might call these events. Typical dream stage fare.

123
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.460
The tragic hero remains reckless in their pursuit of their goal and is blinded

124
00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:13.390
enough by their subsequent success so much so that they don't realize they're

125
00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.340
sowing the seeds of their own destruction.

126
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.540
This is doubly the case for Aniket who is so blinded by the power of Palpatine

127
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.440
offers him that he doesn't realize he's slipping towards the dark side.

128
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.130
And ironically do mean both Padma and himself.

129
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.110
Next up is stage three.

130
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.340
The frustration stage when the tide begins to shift against our tragic hero.

131
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.810
At this point in the journey,

132
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:38.380
Booker says the tragic hero begins to experience a sense of frustration.

133
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.160
And in order to secure, his position may feel compelled to further dark acts,

134
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.290
which lock him into his course of action,

135
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.930
even more irrevocably and episode three.

136
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.290
And it can becomes increasingly frustrated with the limitations of his new found

137
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:52.930
success. While he might sit on the Jedi council,

138
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:56.980
his fellow Jedi will neither grant him the rank of master nor help him save

139
00:07:56.981 --> 00:07:57.670
Padma.

140
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.270
And when Anna can seize another vision of Padma dying this time with OB one,

141
00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:02.104
by her side,

142
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.580
his frustration hits its peak fed up with the Jedi and tempted by Palpatine.

143
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.240
And it can ops to save the chancellor at the last minute and a fit of

144
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:10.901
desperation.

145
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:14.770
He lops off hand number three while mace Windu is forced lightening out the

146
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:18.970
window and saving Palpatine anagen. Finally commits that irrevocable act.

147
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.510
The one which seals his fate as if to underscore this point,

148
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.830
Palpatine tells Anacon.

149
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.670
<v 2>I learned with his transpired here, they will kill us.</v>

150
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.700
<v 0>And those foreboding words bring us to stage four,</v>

151
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.170
the nightmare stage in which the tragic hero finds himself alone with the forces

152
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:37.300
of opposition, arrayed firmly against him.

153
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.890
That's exactly where Anna can lands after he betrays the Jedi order and murders.

154
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:44.170
The last of the separatists in the most of our system,

155
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.940
only for Padma to confront him in what amounts to a truly unhinged rant.

156
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.450
And again, admits to killing children and the separatists alike,

157
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.100
all for pad may sick to see. We.

158
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.870
<v 2>Don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic.</v>

159
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.360
I am more powerful than the chancellor. I can overthrow him

160
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.950
and together you and I can rule the galaxy,

161
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.770
make things the way we want them to be.

162
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:14.990
<v 0>In doing so.</v>

163
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.580
And it can push us away his last and closest ally and any real hope of

164
00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:24.080
redemption when Obi wan steps out of the ship and it can misconstrues this all

165
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.560
as an elaborate plot to kill him and a desperate bid for control of the

166
00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:30.410
situation. He breaks out his soon to be signature,

167
00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:34.460
move the force choke the only problem it's on his wife.

168
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.190
This bleakly transitions us into stage five.

169
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.420
The destruction or death wish stage in which our tragic hero will finally

170
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:44.930
destroy himself isolated from all his friends and family.

171
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.580
The end is now in sight for Anna and after a heated lightsaber duel with obiwan

172
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.220
the two stare each other down over a lava river.

173
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.920
That's when this iconic exchange goes down.

174
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.220
<v 2>Veronica, I have the high ground.</v>

175
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.720
You underestimate my power. Try it.

176
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.510
Remember that.

177
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.280
<v 0>Pride and ambition that led Anak and to kill count Duku and court Palpatine's</v>

178
00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:11.360
friendship here.

179
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:14.600
It leads him to believe that he can finally take down his former master,

180
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.860
even with a fatal disadvantage. So how does that go for him? Yeah.

181
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.780
And it can more like Anna can't insure and it can doesn't experience a

182
00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:24.890
literal death here,

183
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.520
but as he burns on the lava shores of Mustafar cursing his old master,

184
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.470
it's hard not to feel that the boy we met in episode one is metaphorically debt

185
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.810
fittingly in the closing scene of the film.

186
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.560
He's reborn as the most iconic villain in cinema history.

187
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.450
But here's the question. Wisecrack,

188
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.230
if episode three stuck so closely to Booker's five-part structure,

189
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.160
why does it still seem like it's messing up this whole tragedy thing? Now,

190
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.670
maybe this is a lot to ask of the only decent film in a trilogy,

191
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.050
otherwise mired by mediocrity and sand. I don't like sand,

192
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.670
but in all seriousness, we think that film fails into key components of tragedy,

193
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.481
one,

194
00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:06.860
the dramatic flaw and two destiny and how they both interact with this five-part

195
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:07.490
structure.

196
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.330
The concept of the tragic flaw also comes from you guessed it Aristotle,

197
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.160
which translated into its original Greek [inaudible] means to miss the Mark fall

198
00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:17.270
short or aired.

199
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.500
And Aristotle's conception of the term hamartoma is the mistake in judgment that

200
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:26.210
sets our tragic hero on their path and ultimately dooms them and edit is Rex

201
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.780
it's edifices, incessant desire. For knowledge at first,

202
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.870
this desire brings some results. He solves the riddle of the Sphinx,

203
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:37.730
saves thieves and becomes King, but this desire also guarantees his downfall.

204
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.660
When the place starts at Episys searching for the murderer of the previous King.

205
00:11:41.661 --> 00:11:45.890
So he can stop a plague from ravaging his city, except in this relentless quest,

206
00:11:45.891 --> 00:11:46.550
for knowledge,

207
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.720
he misses the Mark by which we mean Oedipus realizes that he killed the King.

208
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.220
His father banged the queen, his mother, and is truly,

209
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:58.060
and literally blind to the cosmic truth of the world. Importantly,

210
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:01.720
this tragic flaw orders, the action of the story, all of the characters,

211
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.770
mistakes are born out of this deficiency as they emotionally spiral into

212
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:08.860
despair. This flaw only skyrockets and intensity,

213
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.850
which is how we get our tragic arc. The problem with episode three though,

214
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.650
is that this tragic flaw is a lot harder to pin down, simply put, and it can,

215
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:21.610
doesn't merely miss the Mark in one way, he's angry, he's proud, he's ambitious.

216
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:25.810
And sometimes he's just an all around and in the philosophy of the forest,

217
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.130
it's all kind of a packaged deal. And yes, before you smash that like button,

218
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.820
I know the film goes to great lengths to explain all these disparate flaws is

219
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.670
the outgrowth of one underpinning flaw fear.

220
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.370
We can see this in both Yoda's warnings.

221
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.290
<v 3>They're full, you must be winching the future. And again,</v>

222
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.070
the fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

223
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.530
<v 0>As well as in Duke who's ramblings.</v>

224
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.160
<v 3>Woke.</v>

225
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.760
<v 0>Whether it's the Jedi or the Sith, it seems like everyone agrees.</v>

226
00:12:56.761 --> 00:12:59.940
That fear is the gateway drug to a lot of bad emotions.

227
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.450
Except when we sit down to analyze the film fear alone,

228
00:13:03.451 --> 00:13:06.060
doesn't really motivate a lot of anecdotes, mistakes,

229
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.010
at least not in the same way, edifice,

230
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.120
his desire for knowledge motivates his mistakes as a result. And again,

231
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.080
his emotional journey reads a bit uneven at times to see what I mean.

232
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.190
Let's revisit Booker's five part structure and see how Anna Cannes tragic floss

233
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.670
was back and forth between these steps and the anticipation stage.

234
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.300
We identified a lust for power and ambition as the tragic flaw that made Annie

235
00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:29.580
can kill count Duca, but then there's this line.

236
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.550
<v 3>Hey, cut off your arm. You wanted revenge.</v>

237
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.061
<v 0>Okay.</v>

238
00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:36.720
So you're probably thinking aniguns lust for power with a side of revenge is his

239
00:13:36.721 --> 00:13:39.450
tragic flaw. But then in the dream stage,

240
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.470
most of the conflict centers around anti-guns moral discomfort over plain spy

241
00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:44.304
for the Jedi.

242
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:49.320
<v 3>You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code against the Republic</v>

243
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.470
against a mentor and a friend that's what's out of place here.

244
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.160
<v 0>His misplaced loyalties would drive to the plot here,</v>

245
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.970
not his desire for power in the ensuing frustration stage.

246
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.530
This misplaced loyalty is further tested until eventually Anacon chooses

247
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:07.290
Palpatine. Remember Palpatine is a trader,

248
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:09.900
so it's not loyalty motivating this decision.

249
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.860
Instead it can chooses the dark side because he fears losing Padma,

250
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.580
which really has nothing to do with this ambition. So far,

251
00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:20.970
his tragic flaw has gone from lust for power to misplace loyalty,

252
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:25.470
to fear of losing his BU of course, this fear seems pretty short-lived though,

253
00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:29.430
because Anacon has no problem choking Padma in the nightmare stage. Yeah.

254
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.990
We're back to power lust again,

255
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.630
complete now with ramblings about ruling an empire,

256
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.440
this flaw carries onto the destruction stage and then credits.

257
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.663
I should note here,

258
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.320
each of these flaws individually makes plenty of logical sense and it can,

259
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.470
penis has been foreshadowed and explained throughout the trilogy.

260
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.820
He has a bad temper.

261
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.680
Doesn't like sand obsesses over losing his loved ones and does a war in episode

262
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:55.130
two, but it doesn't entirely work in the narrative sense.

263
00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:00.080
It feels more sloppy than complex because the tragic flaw changes so drastically

264
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:01.250
throughout the film. We,

265
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:05.150
as the audience are left with a bit of an emotional whiplash take, for example,

266
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.800
the nightmare stage in which Anna can,

267
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:11.540
is all about that power so much so that he actually slaughters a bunch of

268
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:15.920
Jedi children just so we can get more of it to a lot of movie goers at the time,

269
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.490
this offscreen revelation was a shocker and not in a good way.

270
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.240
It just seems so far out of character from the anecdote we knew up to this

271
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:27.350
point, the paddle on losing his temper shirt, acting in revenge,

272
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.460
find vainly seeking glory. Yeah. Going too far to defend those.

273
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.870
He cares about definitely murdering kids to get a promotion of

274
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.860
whats,

275
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.790
but that's because the tragic flaw motivating this action wasn't consistent in

276
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:44.060
the buildup and a can spear was played up in the last stage and is misplaced

277
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:45.380
loyalty in the stage before.

278
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.520
But imagine how powerful the scene would be at every stage mannequin's journey

279
00:15:49.521 --> 00:15:52.430
was motivated by one flaw, say the fear of loss.

280
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.940
Imagine if he had killed count Duku in order to save OB one,

281
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.080
she had against the council out of fear that their plans would cost more lives.

282
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.250
If killing mace Windu directly and immediately saved Padma, which is to say,

283
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.690
imagine of all of these tragic stages expounded upon this same flaw.

284
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.200
If mannequins visions of a dime pad may involve her house burning down from a

285
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:15.590
young leans flaming bag of doorstep, poop, prank, gone wrong,

286
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.340
then maybe the outrageous step of hurting children in the nightmare stage

287
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.930
wouldn't seem so outrageous.

288
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.410
The message being that if you're willing to go to any length to save the ones

289
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:27.620
you love, no matter what you risk becoming a monster.

290
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.240
According to Booker this inevitable slide from good to bad from the light side

291
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:36.080
to the dark side is the key component of the tragic heroes personality.

292
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.560
They are a divided self, one part of their personality,

293
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:40.850
striving against another,

294
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.720
and their downfall amounts to the process whereby a human being may be

295
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:47.720
transformed into a monster, but it's not enough for antique.

296
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:49.190
And to simply become a monster.

297
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.180
He has to become one of the greatest villains of cinematic history while his

298
00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:57.230
lack of a consistent tragic flaw makes for a less satisfying one-off tragedy.

299
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.460
There would also be a problem if his tragic flaw was consistent specifically,

300
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.391
it's possible.

301
00:17:02.391 --> 00:17:07.280
We might relate or even empathize too heavily with diluting the power of the

302
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:10.070
monster. We know he becomes because, and it can,

303
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:13.100
can't just be a good guy who happened to go down the wrong path.

304
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.050
He has to be extra bad.

305
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.220
<v 4>This isn't your average everyday darkness.</v>

306
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.360
This is an advanced darkness.

307
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.620
<v 0>That brings us to our final. And in this case, complicated component of tragedy,</v>

308
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:31.060
fate and akin, and more sense than one was faded to be bad.

309
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.500
This is consistent with classic tragedy where a pervasive sense of inevitability

310
00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:36.730
hangs above heroes,

311
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.170
whether it's Oedipus or Macbeth characters are not only doomed by prophecies,

312
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.250
but often by their very nature of flaws that forced these prophecies to come

313
00:17:45.251 --> 00:17:49.650
true. But for Anacon, as we discussed this dreaded inevitability,

314
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:53.760
doesn't come from a single tragic flaw that renders him sympathetic. Instead,

315
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:56.160
our dread comes primarily from the fact that we,

316
00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:59.940
the audience already know is fake because all the Greeks might've believed in

317
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:04.200
the literal spinners of fate controlling destiny in the star Wars fandom,

318
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.210
we believe in an even greater guy, the Holy Trinity of episodes, four, five,

319
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:13.860
and six that's where episode three's missteps become more forgivable deep

320
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.390
above all else. Lucas had to preserve the integrity of this sacred sank trilogy.

321
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.140
Even if it came at the cost of Anna Ken's character arc. In episode three,

322
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.160
if the film had doubled down on anti-guns fear of loss for his tragic flaw,

323
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.850
he might've joined the Pantheon of other great tragic curios and pop culture

324
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.160
from Michael Corleone until Walter White,

325
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.710
as with our other family mentoring crime bosses,

326
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.430
our hearts would break even more when we see Anik and go past the point of no

327
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:42.570
return and in doing so, we'd experienced the ultimate aim of tragedy,

328
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.880
emotional release or catharsis,

329
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.230
but making anecdote a full tragic hero would inherently ruin a more important

330
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:54.030
character. Darth Vader, our OJI villain, a tragic hero. We pity a villain.

331
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:57.960
We love to Hayden maybe eventually learn to love when he redeemed himself and

332
00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.580
Anna kin by virtue of episodes,

333
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:03.540
four through six was doomed to start off as a very hateable villain.

334
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.470
So what do you think wisecrack does the overwhelming salients of Darth Vader,

335
00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:09.750
the villain doom, Anik, and the tragic hero,

336
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.420
or are we being too hard on this ambitious film?

337
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.910
