00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 0>What's.</v>

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.120
<v 1>Wisecrack Michael here, whether you stand or hate Hamilton,</v>

3
00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:10.610
you've probably heard about a little controversy.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.710
The founding father themed rap musical is full of hideous lies. For example,

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.440
Hamilton's onstage love interest, Angelica Schuyler,

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.600
very clearly wraps that she had no brother.

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.430
<v 0>My father has no funds</v>

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.600
and yet she had at least one [inaudible] okay.

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.820
<v 1>Who cares? Right. But it got me thinking in every piece of historical fiction,</v>

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.170
there's gotta be some aligned between actual fact and necessary fabrication.

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.430
And despite the collective virals, we all get when someone chimes in, uh,

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.790
actually Skyler was also married when she met Hamilton.

13
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.670
This problem raises a pretty important question.

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.740
Does watching historical fiction,

15
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.940
ironically make us dumber about history or isn't musical like Hamilton,

16
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.600
an important tool to get people to care about colonial fiscal policy.

17
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.890
<v 0>But Hamilton forgets his plan would have the government assumed state's debt.</v>

18
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.560
<v 1>From Hamilton to Bohemian Rhapsody to vice,</v>

19
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:08.600
to even a game like Assassin's creed.

20
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.260
Historical fiction is either a great learning tool that you're hung over.

21
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:15.440
Substitute teacher can put on with the lights out or it's. Well,

22
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.700
a horrible crutch used by said hung-over teacher who really would like to just

23
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:20.720
close their eyes.

24
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.280
So what's the deal let's find out in this wisecrack edition on historical

25
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:30.170
fiction and spoilers ahead for true historical events and also stuff people made

26
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:32.420
up about them. But before we get into it,

27
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:35.150
I want to give a shout out to this week, sponsor our patrons,

28
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.380
but they probably won't see this because they have access to all of our videos.

29
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.040
Ad-free. Now, if you can and want to support us, you should check it out.

30
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.230
Patrons, get access to ad-free content,

31
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:49.190
our patron only discord or research documents for our videos and more we even

32
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.590
throw in unlisted bonuses like wisecrack Hangouts,

33
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:54.440
where we stream games and do Q and A's. If that sounds interesting,

34
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:58.730
head over to patrion.com/wisecrack or check out the link in the description

35
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.360
now, back to Hamilton. All right, let's be clear.

36
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.530
Any writer who wants to condense someone's entire life story and do a few hours

37
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:10.010
of screener stage time has to make some hard choices. For example,

38
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:11.120
in many biopics,

39
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:14.930
it's common for the writer to combine several real life people into a single

40
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:18.590
character, or to invent a new character altogether to further the plot,

41
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:22.430
or make a point. If bombshell invents a generic ambitious news anchor,

42
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:26.810
who's a stand in for the many real women she represents. That's not that bad,

43
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.350
right?

44
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.090
Hamilton based on Ron Chernow's 2004 biography of the man also has to use some

45
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:35.270
artistic license and dealing with history, the musical Chronicles,

46
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:39.290
the political career of the American founding father and dope lyricist and his

47
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.580
journey from immigrant orphan.

48
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.300
<v 0>With the cousin, the cousin committed suicide</v>

49
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.310
and tried something new.

50
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.530
<v 1>The secretary of the treasury along the way, it features an American revolution,</v>

51
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:56.120
a juicy sex scandal and a cast of Hamilton's friends, lovers and enemies,

52
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.550
maybe because of its nearly three hour runtime plane manages to avoid many

53
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:04.570
shortcuts that other biopics have to take. Also they wrap kind of fast,

54
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.080
which makes it easy to jam a lot of information in a short amount of time.

55
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.910
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

56
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.960
<v 1>The play is also full of a historical moments like this when John Laurens and</v>

57
00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:24.990
pals introduce themselves as if they're a true book, subway performers,

58
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.250
despite a lack of primary sources on Lafayette's relationship to Showtime,

59
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.970
Hamilton is frequently lauded for its adherence to historical fact.

60
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.710
But when people do quibble,

61
00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:38.610
it's generally when Hamilton's inventions meet historical fact that this weird

62
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:41.250
zone of wait is this actually true?

63
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.310
And that intersection and the resulting confusion about what is,

64
00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:49.050
and isn't true may very well end up making us feel less rather than more

65
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:51.840
informed. For instance, historians, David Wald,

66
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.260
Stryker and Jeffrey Paisley argue that the play is part of the genre of

67
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.350
founder's chic painting Hamilton and the other founders,

68
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.510
and an overly patriotic and positive light.

69
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.680
The storytelling they argue is fueled by made up character and personality

70
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:07.800
traits rather than by the facts and real life.

71
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.910
There's a lot of nuance on Hamilton's relation to racial or class issues in

72
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:15.750
colonial America. But the playwright probably for clarity sake,

73
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.750
chose to skip past that nuance. Instead,

74
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:22.440
Miranda uses a lot of creative license when diving into Hamilton's views on

75
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:24.000
slavery and the play.

76
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.630
John Laurens claims that he and Hamilton write essays against slavery.

77
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.000
And later in Yorktown, the men insist that we'll.

78
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.400
<v 2>Never be free until we end slavery.</v>

79
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.180
<v 1>Walt Stryker and Paisley see this as an exaggerated fantasy portrait of Hamilton</v>

80
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:39.210
as a staunch abolitionist. When in reality Hamilton,

81
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:41.640
wasn't an anti-slavery activist. In fact,

82
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.250
he bought and sold slaves for his in-laws.

83
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.370
Now this all may be very intentional since Miranda,

84
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:51.000
very clearly opted to tell a story about the very white and very slave owning

85
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:54.360
founders through a predominantly black musical tradition with a multicultural

86
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:55.194
cast.

87
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.400
But these likely deliberate mischaracterizations are really important and can

88
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:01.200
help us understand a bigger phenomenon,

89
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.970
something I'm going to call the uncanny Valley of truth in historical fiction.

90
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.310
You probably know of the uncanny Valley.

91
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.060
It's basically a graph showing how cute things get as they take on human

92
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:16.620
characteristics until they get to human life and become absolutely horrifying,

93
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.010
but then they get even more humanlike and it's totally fine. Again,

94
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.180
that uncomfortably close to human part of the graph is the uncanny Valley.

95
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.223
It's unsettling.

96
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.890
So Sonic the hedgehog is kind of cute because he's a hedgehog with a few human

97
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.680
elements like walking up, right talking and wearing gloves,

98
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.570
but give Sonics and two realistic baby teeth and Holy hell your Indian canny

99
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:37.230
Valley.

100
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.500
Now what's some Steve Buscemi eyes on him and we can see how deep this abyss

101
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:44.490
really is while no one is getting nightmares about Lin Manuel's rap battle.

102
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.670
We can see a similar kind of graph in the truth and fiction.

103
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.750
If I were to tell you a story of a time-traveling Scott backhoe who gets stuck

104
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.440
in a wrestlers body, you'd be like, cool. That's not real history.

105
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.630
On the other hand, if I were instead to show you ESPN,

106
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.330
the last dance with baccala deep fake under the body of Tony [inaudible] you

107
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.080
might say,

108
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.610
what the is this real that Scott a play for the Chicago bulls

109
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.510
that's because the latter example in somewhere in the uncanny Valley of the

110
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.090
truth, the part of the scale between fiction and reality,

111
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:16.220
where something looks close enough to reality,

112
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.110
to be wilderness unsuspecting audience.

113
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.020
In the case of people complaining about historical fiction.

114
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.830
It's the moment where the line between fake rap battles and real beliefs between

115
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:28.910
Hamilton blur and become unsettling for anyone who is paying attention.

116
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.620
The real danger of course,

117
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.800
is that instead of becoming more informed about historical events through some

118
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:34.820
light embellishments,

119
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.210
people become more ignorant as they fill their brains with fiction consumed as

120
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:38.840
truth.

121
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.070
You as a casual viewer of Hamilton might have assumed some details to be rooted

122
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:46.550
in historical fact because why would they make up the assertion? For instance,

123
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.220
that Thomas Jefferson was absent during most of the war,

124
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.440
our guests probably because it made for a very charming opening song to act

125
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.633
two.

126
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.340
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

127
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.990
<v 1>Before we start sounding too curmudgeonly,</v>

128
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.020
a quick caveat compared to most historical fiction.

129
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.870
Miranda's fact checking is actually pretty buttoned up.

130
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.110
There are far more egregious examples of writers, convincingly,

131
00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:14.260
changing history in thereby very much misleading their audience.

132
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.300
Still the fact that within Miranda's well-researched story that's so many

133
00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:22.900
details are just playing wrong. Can feel a little bit alarming.

134
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.010
It speaks to the potential risks of trusting historical fiction without spending

135
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.190
hours. Fact-checking it afterwards at the very least,

136
00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:31.990
it might make you embarrass yourself.

137
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.120
<v 0>So like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait,</v>

138
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.850
except for the Einsteins. No worries.

139
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.800
<v 1>This more apparent than in writer, director,</v>

140
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:44.380
Adam McKay's absurdist to biopic vice,

141
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.040
which claims to be based on the real history of Dick Cheney's tenure as vice

142
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.000
president under George W. Bush as such McKay's seems pretty.

143
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.570
Self-aware about the problems of turning history into a blockbuster film.

144
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.680
With that in mind,

145
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:59.830
he goes to great lengths to signpost the fictionalized parts of the movie.

146
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.821
At one point,

147
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:04.540
Dick and Lynne Cheney have an entire conversation in Shakespearian verse.

148
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.870
<v 0>Why fan crown as if to.</v>

149
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.840
<v 1>We drive home, the fact that we made this whole thing up uncanny Valley averted,</v>

150
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.580
but as journalist Jen Williams,

151
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:18.460
put it the film as a whole is about as accurate about Cheney.

152
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:19.720
And the Iraq war is shark.

153
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.830
NATO is about sharks and the weather Williams argues that the exclusive focus on

154
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.460
Cheney reduces the roles of everyone else who made decisions in the Bush

155
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:28.660
administration. Also,

156
00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:33.400
the film just makes a lot of things up one Pivotal's new advice set in the 1970s

157
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:36.310
depicts a conversation between Dick Cheney and Antonin Scalia.

158
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:37.690
That seems true to history.

159
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.340
Only problem it's entirely a work of fiction in the scenes Scalia

160
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:45.130
introduces Cheney to the concept of unitary executive.

161
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.880
<v 0>A theory. Are you familiar with the theory of the unitary executive?</v>

162
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.920
<v 1>The concept of unitary executive theory wasn't even around until the 1980s and</v>

163
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:56.190
according to legal scholars, the film butchers the term,

164
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.910
interpreting it to mean that everything the president does is legal,

165
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.950
which is simply not true.

166
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.490
And his apparent determination to paint Cheney as a mastermind,

167
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:08.880
who is building a case for unlimited executive power early in his career,

168
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.430
Adam McKay dreamed up a fake conversation.

169
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.080
This may be compelling when creating a cogent character arc vices Cheney finally

170
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.490
got the unlimited power he had wanted for so long, but it's simply not based.

171
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:21.324
In fact,

172
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.870
it's also implied that Dick Cheney received intelligence briefings before the

173
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:25.704
president did.

174
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.560
<v 3>We will also be receiving the daily intelligence briefing before the president</v>

175
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.570
that gets us inside of the decision curve.

176
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.860
<v 1>This is a magnificent detail showing Cheney's apparent capacity to manipulate</v>

177
00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:38.660
his presidential boss, George Bush.

178
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.870
Unfortunately it seems to be entirely invented,

179
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.130
but there's no Shakespeare or absurdism to indicate this part of the movies

180
00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:49.250
fiction by sometimes, but not always signposting.

181
00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:53.960
What was fake McCain inadvertently made the uncanny Valley of truth so much

182
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.350
worse combined with an uncanny makeup job on Christian bale.

183
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.860
The presentation had audiences leaving theaters thinking, wow,

184
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.860
I can't believe Dick Cheney did all those things.

185
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.180
And maybe that's exactly what Adam McKay wanted to influence public opinion with

186
00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:09.200
a compelling story,

187
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.250
but it had journalists like James Mann sounding the alarm for it being lazy.

188
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:17.270
And they're responsible even as men argued that the real life actions of Cheney

189
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.680
were far worse. Filmmakers venture into this uncanny Valley of truth. A lot,

190
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.450
especially in biopics and period pieces based on true events and also whatever

191
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:30.950
the hell this is. So can historical fiction ever avoid this trap?

192
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.140
The way information is communicated and the expectations of the audience seemed

193
00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:36.440
to make all the difference.

194
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.490
It seems like some works of historical fiction can get by without much scrutiny

195
00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:44.240
because it's clear that they're works of art and not real playing out at the

196
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.630
time. They never venture into that uncanny Valley of truth,

197
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.730
or if they do the stakes are.

198
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.403
<v 4>Yes.</v>

199
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.740
<v 1>Take for example,</v>

200
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:59.270
the favorite Yorgos Lanthimos his dark comedy is so obviously a satire that it

201
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:01.580
would be hard to mistake it as a story accurate,

202
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.700
even though the characters are loosely based on real people,

203
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.290
a melodramatic plot and rabbit.

204
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.880
<v 4>Dialogue met him and told me,</v>

205
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.750
you may have the tapestry budget you asked for spend one penny more,

206
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.340
and I will take your fingernails in view.

207
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.750
<v 1>Physical comedy, unconventional camera angles, and cross dissolves on bunnies.</v>

208
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.050
Make it very clear that this stuff shouldn't be taken as fact.

209
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.860
It also helps that there wasn't a block of text at the top of the film claiming

210
00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:26.510
that it was based on a true story.

211
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.590
Of course you could claim not to be based in any fact and actually smuggle in

212
00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:31.370
real history,

213
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.850
some historical fiction centers around completely fake premises and characters

214
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.810
from period horror, like HBO's Lovecraft country to video game series.

215
00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:40.850
Like I say, essence Crete in these works,

216
00:11:40.851 --> 00:11:44.510
the central characters are completely made up and things like monsters and

217
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:45.950
genetic memory exist,

218
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.490
but there's still knowledge to be gleaned from them about how things work

219
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.360
historical accuracy comes through in things like costume design world-building

220
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.500
general depictions of past customs Assassin's creed.

221
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:59.560
Unity is a helpful example set during the French revolution.

222
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:03.160
The games design was heavily influenced by archival research and recruited the

223
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:05.050
help of multiple academic historians.

224
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.950
Dr. John Clement Martin consulted on the script and scholarly rent Turco

225
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:11.830
assisted with the look and feel of 18th century Paris.

226
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.330
The resulting virtual model of the city was so detailed that Ubisoft offered to

227
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.840
use the games digital version of the Notre Dame cathedral to help rebuild the

228
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:22.300
real one after it burned down in 2019.

229
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.710
So all the whole traveling into your ancestors brains and characters are quite

230
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.910
obviously fiction.

231
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.050
The experience of France during the revolution might have some historical value

232
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.450
for players and HBO is Watchman.

233
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.950
There was a kind of reverse uncanny Valley where the very real Tulsa race

234
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:43.420
massacre was dramatized in a story featuring a blue dude who hangs dong many

235
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:47.020
viewers instead of being caught off guard by a historical fabrication,

236
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.220
Allah Hamilton were instead caught off guard by a historical truth.

237
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.350
Similarly in Lovecraft country,

238
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.440
the characters and story are entirely a work of fiction,

239
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.300
especially the horrifying monsters,

240
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.100
still many of the scenarios that characters experience mirror very real

241
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:05.680
experiences of black Americans during Jim Crow.

242
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.150
So hearing the sheriff explain what a sundown town is, might get people asking,

243
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.103
is this true?

244
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:16.260
<v 5>And have you all know what a son downtown is? Yes, sir. We do.</v>

245
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.960
What is it? The sun down County.

246
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.760
<v 1>And then they might Google it.</v>

247
00:13:20.761 --> 00:13:23.940
And now you have someone who learned something through the power of fiction.

248
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.223
This is all to say,

249
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.740
just because something is a fictionalized account of history doesn't mean we

250
00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:30.840
should knock it for being all lies.

251
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.990
It just kind of depends what the lessons are and how they're communicated.

252
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.410
It also matters how we as an audience approach the material,

253
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.340
but to give back to more cut and dry historical fiction like Hamilton or vice

254
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.181
their problems,

255
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:47.070
aren't unique to biopics or bio musicals while Stryker and Paisley

256
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.100
acknowledged a lot of their problems with Miranda's portrait of Hamilton

257
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.550
actually came from turnout's characterization of Hamilton in the biography.

258
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.630
The musical is based on it's simply dropped the latest version of founder's chic

259
00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.493
to a Fest.

260
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.070
<v 2>Let's take a stand with the stamina. God has granted as Hamilton.</v>

261
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.410
Let's see all the cannons.

262
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.790
<v 1>The point is if Hamilton, the play can lose some of the nuance.</v>

263
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.780
So can actual written texts of history. The editors of the book,

264
00:14:12.781 --> 00:14:17.430
historians on Hamilton admit that history is not simply a matter of facts,

265
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.580
but isn't an interpretation of the existing archival record,

266
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.550
actively constructed by whoever is serving as the historian,

267
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.570
the musical acknowledges that there are certain things we simply cannot know.

268
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.321
Indeed.

269
00:14:28.321 --> 00:14:31.680
There is a whole song about how we don't really know what went down between

270
00:14:31.681 --> 00:14:34.800
Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison in the room where it happens.

271
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.550
<v 2>What else was in the way of it happening?</v>

272
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:40.590
<v 1>Yes,</v>

273
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.120
a healthy amount of self-awareness and another historians on Hamilton essay.

274
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.680
Joseph Adelman stresses that Hamilton makes absolutely no claim to be a work of

275
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:53.120
scholarly history. And it resembles a tradition of historical fiction.

276
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.940
That's been around almost as long as the United States.

277
00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.800
He writes that almost as soon as the revolutionary war ended in 1783,

278
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.630
Americans began to discuss hypothesize and conjecture about what the new nation

279
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:09.920
would be in part by arguing over how it was born to Adelman.

280
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.310
Hamilton is something that's not entirely credible historically,

281
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.540
but is incredibly accessible to a wide audience as a piece of historical

282
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:18.170
fiction,

283
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.950
which makes it valuable while it's important for scholars to engage with and

284
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:23.480
call out its factual errors.

285
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.100
There's no denying that Hamilton at the very least teaches us about how history

286
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:32.750
is communicated and canonized and at most gets us excited about history.

287
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.270
And I think that has to be worth something.

288
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.150
All I know is that when I die the answer to.

289
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.240
<v 6>[Inaudible].</v>

290
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.930
<v 1>Adam McKay. So what do you think wisecrack is historical fiction,</v>

291
00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:50.380
a useful tool to get as jazzed about the story of America's founding and the

292
00:15:50.381 --> 00:15:52.870
exhilarating history of constitutional law,

293
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.530
or is it just going to confuse everyone on their AP history exam?
