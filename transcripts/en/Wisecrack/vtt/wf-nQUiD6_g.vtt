<v 1>Wisecrack Michael, here with the video that's long overdue.</v>

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.230
The last of us too was one of the most anticipated games of 2020,

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.420
but it wasn't without controversy.

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.610
The game made some variable choices that made some people very,

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.770
very mad. To be honest,

7
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.950
we were hesitant to make a video about it because we didn't want to rehash the

8
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:28.010
same points that had already been made in a million other articles.

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.850
<v 0>Videos have been making us do this.</v>

<v 1>How Austin tracked out a PlayStation and did some research for us and by</v>

11
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:41.090
research, I mean a 36 hour last of us, two marathon,

12
00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:43.640
that was definitely bad for his wellbeing,

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.530
but lead to a pretty mind blowing revelation specifically that the game does

14
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:50.570
one thing incredibly well,

15
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.350
it hijacks your brain's hard wiring to make you question everything you know

16
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.870
about empathy. Welcome to this wise,

17
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.460
Greg edition on the philosophy of the last of us one and two and serious

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.660
spoilers ahead. And before we jump into the minds of Ellie and Abby,

19
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:09.440
I want to tell you about another game that you should binge for 36 hours.

20
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:12.380
And that is this week sponsor raid shadow legends.

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.030
By now you have to know that this game is an awesome hero collector RPG that is

22
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:19.040
available to play on PC and mobile.

23
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.060
Since downloading I've become quite a professional at the PVD battles in the

24
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:23.840
arena.

25
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.470
It's more fun to play against other players because it's a true Testament to how

26
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:30.620
well you've equipped your team. The game is constantly changing,

27
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.590
and that is just one of the things that makes it so fun to play.

28
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.610
The most recent update includes a new advanced quest system with new rewards in

29
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:38.444
the artifact.

30
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.080
It where you can craft artifacts instead of having to collect them during rates,

31
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.850
they also release some new champions.

32
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:45.560
So if you thought you've collected them all,

33
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.540
you'll have to get back into the grind.

34
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.900
Right now they're developing the doom tower, which will be released shortly.

35
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.540
So check all that out today by downloading the game,

36

38
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:03.470

39
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:06.680
but only for the next 30 days. So check it out today.

40
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.870
Now back to the show and now a quick summary in the original, last of us,

41
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.680
our protagonist Joel must safely shepherd the young Ellie across the country,

42
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:20.630
amidst a zombie apocalypse. Importantly, Ellie is immune from the pathogen,

43
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:23.450
infecting people and can be studied to develop a vaccine.

44
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.430
The only problem the doctors have to kill her in the process. So Joel murders,

45
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.220
those doctors saving Ellie and dooming humanity.

46
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.990
Part two kicks off four years later as Joel and Ellie enjoy a relatively stable

47
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:36.770
existence.

48
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.850
But then Ellie learns that Joel lied to her about what happened and here's where

49
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:45.020
people get mad early in the story, we switched to a new character, Abby,

50
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.450
the daughter of one of the doctors, Joel murdered.

51
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.840
She's out to a venture father, which is bad news for Joel,

52
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.320
who is brutally beaten to death as Ellie watches in the aftermath.

53
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.100
Ellie swears revenge, which I mean fair enough,

54
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.690
but here's where things get tricky. After Joel's death.

55
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.430
Our Ellie revenge quest is interrupted by approximately 10 hours of Abbey time.

56
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.340
We play her backstory and relive events that we already expect from Ellie's

57
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:14.280
perspective. Then Abby learns that Ellie killed her.

58
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.580
Ex-boyfriend her fury rekindles and she's slash we,

59
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:20.310
the players set out to track Ellie down and fight her,

60
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.460
which thankfully ends in a draw. Finally,

61
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:27.420
we turn to play as Ellie who leaves her comfortable domestic life to avenge

62
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.283
Joel,

63
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.150
Ellie finds Abby who is about to be crucified and decides to rescue her so

64
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.550
she can force her to fight one final time.

65
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.450
But when the moment comes to kill Abby, Ellie decides to let her live.

66
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.750
The game ends with Ellie alone in her now abandoned home,

67
00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:46.740
playing the guitar that Joel gave to her calling the final conversation they had

68
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.300
that evening before he was murdered,

69
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.620
where she promises to try to forgive him for stopping the operation heartwarming

70
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:54.180
story. Right? Well,

71
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:58.200
not everyone was enamored with the whole 10 hours of plane as the villain,

72
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.520
but at the risk of making you all hate me to suggest that this move was really

73
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.500
cool. If only for one reason, it versus us to rethink our conception of empathy.

74
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.370
Here's why psychologists outlined two types of empathy.

75
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.190
There's cognitive empathy and affective empathy.

76
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.690
Cognitive empathy is when a person can imaginably take the role of another and

77
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:22.290
can understand and accurately predict that person's thoughts, feelings,

78
00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:25.800
and actions. Basically. If I put myself in my roommate's shoes,

79
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.210
I might predict that me eating his last pepperoni hot pocket in the shower would

80
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:33.690
rightfully lead him to want to drown me in low quality marinara sauce.

81
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.760
But when people talk about empathy,

82
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:38.040
they're often talking about affective empathy,

83
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.420
affective empathy is a vicarious emotional response to perceived emotional

84
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.330
experiences of others ever physically recoil.

85
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.520
When Michael Scott does a racist acts, well,

86
00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:51.930
I come to my convenience store or felt a Pang of sadness when Simba weeps over

87
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:52.770
his dead father,

88
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.500
that's affective empathy. This type of empathy,

89
00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:02.130
that video games are great at creating, playing as a character.

90
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:05.400
It makes it all the time easier to empathize with them and feel their sorrow or

91
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:06.030
joy.

92
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.020
And it's our innate understanding of effective empathy that makes us feel so

93
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:11.940
uncomfortable playing as Abby.

94
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.920
How dare you make me feel for this monster to better understand our discomfort.

95
00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:20.910
It helps to consider that effective empathy is an emotional contagion.

96
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.760
According to neuroscientists, Matthieu Ricard,

97
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.840
an emotional contagion is when a person automatically feels another person's

98
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:31.320
emotion without knowing that he or she is the one that revoked it.

99
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.590
And without being really aware of what has happened ever,

100
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.080
unintentionally yawned, because a friend yawned,

101
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.830
this can basically happen with emotions as well. Effective empathy,

102
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:45.210
as a result can make us lose ourselves in another person and thus lose full

103
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.740
control of our actions.

104
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.910
Perhaps nothing can explain this dilemma better than last of us itself.

105
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.450
In the first game, we experienced both types of empathy, right?

106
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:58.400
From the beginning, we start by controlling Joel's. As we walk in,

107
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.010
her shoes were being primed to associate with her.

108
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.220
So of course we start to root for her, but even more,

109
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.100
we start to feel her feelings and you guessed it.

110
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.450
We experience affective empathy for her, but after a surprisingly short,

111
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:14.450
while she dies and it hits hard,

112
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.720
we experienced the loss as something intensely personal.

113
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.990
The character we identified with has been taken from us.

114
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.060
So when we start playing as Joel who has experienced the same loss,

115
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.980
we just kind of get his pain.

116
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.250
And when Joel takes on the responsibility of getting Ellie to safety,

117
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.530
all these feelings come rushing back to us.

118
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.200
We can see the world from his perspective.

119
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.310
We accept it is hard outer shell with regard to Ellie,

120
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.640
because to let her in would be to open himself up to more suffering.

121
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.900
Essentially we're able to feel both cognitive and affective empathy for him.

122
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.490
But then in part to the creative use of controlling multiple characters is about

123
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:54.850
to complicate things a lot. As we learn simple games,

124
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.890
play techniques such as running, jumping,

125
00:06:56.891 --> 00:06:59.380
and cautiously shuffling along Snoke or alleges.

126
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.390
The game teaches us with baby steps,

127
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.740
building us up through a connection with Abby and like the warm and fuzzy

128
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:07.690
memories we have of learning to ride a bike.

129
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.400
We get sucked into feeling warm and fuzzy about Abby. If we're being cynical,

130
00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:14.920
the game is manipulating us into caring about this person.

131
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.030
We walk in her shoes and we are thrust into some pretty intense emotional

132
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:23.290
experiences with Andy as her and then our worldview

133
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.590
changes. Now, Abby is on a mission to kill Joel.

134
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.260
Not only are we completely floored by Joel's murder, but we're complicit.

135
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.870
I just want to do escape reality for a while via a video game.

136
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.960
And now I'm an accomplice in my friend's murder,

137
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.250
which gets us to the real question that the last of us two raises is empathy.

138
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:44.620
All it's cracked up to be in against empathy.

139
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.060
Paul bloom explores the limitation of our feeling for others as he defines it.

140
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.320
Empathy is a spotlight directing attention aid to where it's needed.

141
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.040
Doesn't sound so horrible, right? So what's your great Paul.

142
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.850
The problem with empathy is that it limits our attention and our capacity to

143
00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:04.390
help to only individuals or individual events.

144
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.860
Remember what Ricard said about losing ourselves via emotional contagion? Well,

145
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.130
bloom expands the problem by suggesting that all types of things,

146
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.940
but the restrict our ability to think about the wider social consequences of our

147
00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:17.470
very narrow spotlight.

148
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.520
That's why it's easy to get caught up with news stories that feature human faces

149
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:25.180
say a kid whose family can't afford to celebrate Christmas this year.

150
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.320
It's also very easy to donate a toy train and feel super noble and not ask

151
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:33.220
questions about structural poverty. If we're so Bewitched by empathy,

152
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:34.241
bloom worries.

153
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:38.230
This will Ventas from being able to engage in larger causes that require our

154
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:41.800
attention. Things like humanitarian or environmental causes.

155
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.610
This limitation is nicely displayed in the climax of the last of us two in the

156
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.490
ad B versus Ellie battle. At this point in the game,

157
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:50.860
we've played as Abby for 10 hours.

158
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.020
Maybe we've even started to empathize with her.

159
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.700
We liked her relationship with her pops, understand her revenge mission.

160
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.030
Maybe we even buy into a romantic story. I mean,

161
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.540
Owen seems like a cool dude, but here's the kicker.

162
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.930
How many of us actually wanted Abby to win? I'd bet.

163
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:10.500
Most of us actually tried to let Ellie kill us while controlling Abby,

164
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.410
but we were forced to try to be Ellie, because again,

165
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.180
this game is not pure fun escapism for that stick with animal

166
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:22.020
crossing. And here's the punchline. Our commitment to Ellie,

167
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.910
even despite maybe getting Abby's mission was never really challenged.

168
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.500
Our bond was already solidified nothing, not even a full games, length,

169
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.190
immersive experience through another character could shake us from our empathic

170
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:36.240
connection with Ellie.

171
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.530
The reason we side with Ellie is because we have already aligned with her in

172
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.311
Bloom's terms,

173
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:45.030
the spotlight of our attention and our aid had already been focused on her and

174
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:45.864
her mission.

175
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.700
Even if Abby might be justified in seeking revenge per case is moot because it's

176
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:53.820
not our cause bloom leans into his critique.

177
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:57.750
By suggesting that empathic connection can actually lead to violence,

178
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.980
anger and evil,

179
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.260
evil for bloom is caused by dehumanization and objectification and our ingrained

180
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:06.840
anger at Abby. You could be considered dehumanizing,

181
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.540
just scrolling through message boards shows just how much people hate Abby and

182
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:16.260
enjoy her suffering. When she's crucified at the end, it's pretty dark,

183
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.010
but is she beyond redemption? Can we see humanity in her?

184
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.910
Can we let ourselves side with her maybe after all,

185
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:28.230
what has she done to make us hate her kill Joel? Right, but Joel,

186
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:32.280
wasn't perfect. He made a pretty ethically ambiguous decision in his own,

187
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:35.580
right by saving Ellie and ended up killing Abby's father.

188
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:39.480
A doctor who was trying to save humanity from Abby's perspective,

189
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.530
this jerk jeopardized finding a cure for the virus and killed her dad.

190
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.300
So it's complicated,

191
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.650
but that's precisely the quandary that bloom is raising when empathy drives our

192
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:53.490
ethical standards, it often makes us dismiss the larger context,

193
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.050
a sort of ethical tunnel.

194
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.480
Swear to me that everything that you've said about the fireflies is true.

195
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.270
I swear this way,

196
00:11:02.271 --> 00:11:05.570
the game is revealing both the power and limits of empathy,

197
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.010
and it's pretty cool,

198
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.610
but is the game intentionally playing with this to try to teach us something

199
00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:12.740
about the cycle of violence. Again,

200
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:17.120
maybe bloom can help for him stepping outside of our limited empathic

201
00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:19.760
connections is what he calls rational. Compassion.

202
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.410
Rational compassion does not deny the reality of empathy or even it's important,

203
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.760
but rational compassion isn't based on simply acting according to our empathy.

204
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.470
Instead it's built on calculated decision-making processes to get us outside our

205
00:11:33.471 --> 00:11:35.060
limited empathic abilities.

206
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.620
So maybe we can speculate on what bloom might say about the last of us two.

207
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.330
We can still root for Ellie. It's natural. We are hardwired for empathy,

208
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.160
and we're just more invested in her,

209
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.210
but we can and should also pause to reflect on Abby's humanity and the

210
00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:51.680
complexity of the situation.

211
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.390
We can think beyond the empathic connections we made with Joel and Ellie,

212
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.950
rather than simply condemning Abby and celebrating her crucifixion in this way.

213
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:03.340
The last of us parked two shows us how messy human connection is.

214
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.690
Ethical situations are complicated. It's not always so obvious.

215
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:09.640
Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.

216
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.630
And maybe this is because empathy shouldn't be the ultimate source for making

217
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:14.680
ethical decisions.

218
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.010
Maybe we can't just rely on our immediate feelings of connection,

219
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.220
but at the same time, we can't just on empathy either.

220
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.940
There's something important about learning to see and feel the world from a

221
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:28.570
perspective that's not ours. So what are the takeaways?

222
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.230
Maybe the last of us part two is so divisive yet. So great.

223
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.720
Precisely because it throws us into the sticky,

224
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:37.990
messy world of human connection and we have to navigate through it.

225
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.750
Even the stuff that repulses us at times,

226
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.270
and like any truly immersive experience,

227
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.780
perhaps we've been transformed through the connections we've made broken,

228
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:50.350
resisted, and tried to simply ignore. But what do you guys think?

229
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.820
Should we rely on empathy to guide our personal ethics or does doing so prevent

230
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:58.600
us from seeing the bigger picture, let us know in the comments big,
