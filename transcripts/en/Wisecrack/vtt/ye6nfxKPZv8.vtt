1
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.750
<v 1>Of wisecrack Michael, here to talk about everyone's favorite Yuletide, underdog,</v>

2
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.970
or, uh, under deer that's right.

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.110
Rudolph Sansa's red nose minion who was best memorialized in that 1964,

4
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:16.970
stop motion, animated special.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.930
It's a heartwarming depiction of our scrappy little friend finding acceptance in

6
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:23.870
his community despite being a bioluminescent freak.

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.760
But what if the movie can accidentally teach us about the dystopia of modern

8
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.060
life.

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.893
<v 0>Right?</v>

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.590
<v 1>Ruin your childhood in this wisecrack addition on the philosophy of Rudolph the</v>

11
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.440
Red-Nosed reindeer. And of course, spoilers ahead.

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.160
Before we get too deep into the world of stop motion, holiday cinema,

13
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.150
I wanted to take a second to talk about my favorite Island of misfit toys,

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.620
the wisecrack Patrion.

15
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.520
It's a community of folks who have no problem finding the deepest of meanings in

16
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:53.780
the weirdest of places.

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.410
Not to mention you get to watch all of our videos early and without ads.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.200
where you can connect with like-minded folks and even shared takes with

20
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.110
wisecrack, host and writers. To give you a free preview.

21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.840
Here are some of my hot takes on Christmas movies.

22
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.630
Diehard doesn't actually count as a Christmas movie,

23
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:14.350
but in Bruge absolutely does for Christmases.

24
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.330
It's an underrated classic exploring the fluidity of the American family.

25
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.020
The night before is a great movie to watch with your grandparents and or young

26
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.720
children and home alone. Joe Pesci is actually the good guy.

27
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.760
And until Jeff Bridges plays Santa in a movie,

28
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.140
I'm not interested in any cinematic representations of Kris Kringle for takes

29
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:32.630
like these and ones that are even worse. Go to

patrion.com/wisecrack today. Now back to the show,

33
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.490
but first a quick recap,

34
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.850
Rudolph follows the adventures of the eponymous reindeer who was born with one

35
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:51.050
very prominent trait.

36
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.330
<v 2>He's got a shiny nose, shiny I'd even say a glow.</v>

37
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.360
<v 1>That had been celebrated for his gift.</v>

38
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.510
Rudolph receives a crash course in feeling ashamed of his body,

39
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.100
taught by his own father.

40
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.020
<v 2>You're like it and where it is,</v>

41
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.070
there are more important things in comfort.

42
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.200
<v 1>Rudolph is instructed to hide his shame,</v>

43
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.620
but of course you can't keep an incandescent nose hidden for long.

44
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.820
Once its cover is blown.

45
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:23.330
Our hero finds himself ruthlessly mocked to the point where he enters a

46
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:25.850
self-imposed exile on the road,

47
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.130
Rudolph teams up with a fellow North pole weirdo.

48
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.730
Hermie the elf on their journey. The, to meet the prospector Yukon,

49
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:36.200
Cornelius narrowly avoid the abominable snow monster and end up at this surreal

50
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:36.651
place.

51
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:41.300
The Island of misfit toys eventually though Rudolph realizes that he can't keep

52
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:44.630
running away from his problems and decides to return home.

53
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.530
The only problem his family has been captured by the abominable snow monster,

54
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.880
but with help from his friends,

55
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:53.360
Rudolph is able to save his family and live happily ever after. Well,

56
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.380
almost after a last minute snowstorm hits the North pole grounding Santa's

57
00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:00.490
sleigh. It seems like Christmas will be canceled.

58
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.300
<v 3>Everything is grounded. Oh, the poor.</v>

59
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.250
<v 1>That is until old Kris Kringle realizes he's got a pair of headlights in the</v>

60
00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:09.084
form of Rudolph.

61
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.850
<v 3>No, that</v>

62
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.143
wonderful note.

63
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.920
<v 1>Leads. The team. Santa picks up all the misfit toys and Christmas is saved.</v>

64
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.240
The stories takeaway seems to be bullying people for being different is not

65
00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:28.980
cool. So a case closed, not quite incidentally,

66
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:32.670
Rudolph is also a weird masterclass and the dystopian reality of what

67
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:37.470
philosopher Michel Fuko called bio power or bio politics. Basically,

68
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:41.010
if being in charge used to mean beheading your subjects when they were naughty,

69
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.400
modern government power is about the management of life.

70
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.350
AKA bio politics.

71
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.190
It's about keeping a welfare disease-free population who can show up to work on

72
00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:52.380
time and go fight in a war if you need them to.

73
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.000
But what happens when people resist being managed when they either can't or

74
00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:01.920
won't be good productive citizens enter deviancy or the violation of

75
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:06.060
social norms. Since that deviance is a threat to the biopolitical order,

76
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.700
it must be policed. Historically,

77
00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:12.870
these deviants were criminal misfits or labeled mad or considered physically

78
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.340
unfit to do the work or unwilling to do the whole be heterosexual and make

79
00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:21.930
babies thing on the flip side of deviancy and file politics is normalization,

80
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.651
reforming,

81
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:26.340
criminals and sexual deviance and so on so that they can be integrated into

82
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:30.630
society. Now you might be wondering what this all has to do with Rudolph.

83
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.780
It might seem like a stretch, but throughout it's 15 minute runtime,

84
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.760
almost every single major plot point explores how biopower normalizes and

85
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:42.390
disciplines, deviance, social norms and Christmas town are pretty simple.

86
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.380
Wake up and do your part to make Christmas happen for the kids. For example,

87
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.700
be an elf making toys and these norms work great for their leaders.

88
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.050
Santa's whose primary aim is, you know, Christmas for whatever reason,

89
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.760
even when the elves aren't on the job,

90
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.690
Santa's ensures that they remain loyal tireless workers by having them

91
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:05.130
participate in elf practice, which by the way is totally not brainwash.

92
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.200
<v 3>We worked hard all day.</v>

93
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.500
<v 1>It doesn't just out there reindeer, for example can fly.</v>

94
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.520
And so Santa has created a regimented training program to take advantage of this

95
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:18.230
trait.

96
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.350
<v 3>Our first game is called pickup. We all want to [inaudible].</v>

97
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.580
<v 1>In the North pole.</v>

98
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:27.720
It's not crazy to say that a reindeer's whole existence revolves around working

99
00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:30.600
for Santa. Just look at the moment. Rudolph is born.

100
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.850
<v 3>Well daughter, where's the new member of the family after all,</v>

101
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:40.170
if he's going to be on my team someday, he'd better get to know me. But.

102
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.970
<v 1>What happens when someone deviates from the norm take Hermie Rudolph's El friend</v>

103
00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:48.210
who would rather be a dentist than a Toysmith for whatever reason,

104
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:52.020
dentistry isn't exactly considered a social utility in the North pole.

105
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.800
So he is basically astrocytes from the social order. Rudolph's nose,

106
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.560
isn't a hindrance to his function,

107
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.490
but as physical abnormality gets aggressively policed by his family and his

108
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:04.280
fellow juvenile reindeer, despite both our heroes,

109
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.670
having very real ways in which they could contribute to society.

110
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.360
They're deemed to have little to no social value because they don't fit in.

111
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.040
<v 3>It's like he said, I'm never fit in.</v>

112
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.300
<v 1>In effect Rudolph and Hermie are what scholars, David T. Mitchell and Sharon L.</v>

113
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.740
Snyder would call nonproductive bodies or those who have been shunned largely by

114
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:25.600
virtue of biological incapacity,

115
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:29.320
aesthetic non-conformity and or non-normative labor patterns.

116
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.220
And what does the biopolitical state of Christmas town do to nonproductive

117
00:06:33.221 --> 00:06:33.790
bodies?

118
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.500
It expels them or treats them with such hostility that they expelled themselves.

119
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.640
Hermie for example,

120
00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:43.150
leaves after his boss threatens to fire him for giving adult teeth,

121
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.890
they don't even ask the question,

122
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.990
why can't our society handle more Dalton and Rudolph is told that

123
00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:51.850
he's forbidden to practice with other Rangers.

124
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.520
<v 3>Not you better go home with your folks from non dang.</v>

125
00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:03.760
We won't let Rudolph joining any reindeer games, right?

126
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.350
<v 1>Did we mention that Santa is kind of a Dick here?</v>

127
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.870
<v 3>You should be ashamed of your show. Walk up. He had a nice tape.</v>

128
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.340
<v 1>It's not just Rudolph and Hermie who are expelled from society. In fact,</v>

129
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.000
the outside world is teaming with other nonproductive bodies.

130
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.020
Perhaps nothing embodies this better than the entire Island of misfit toys.

131
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.940
And the platonic ideal of pointless toys job is to bring a child happiness as

132
00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:34.990
such toys who are unable to fill this role are useless and are therefore

133
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.350
Castaway for such trivialities as having the wrong name.

134
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.880
<v 3>My name is don't kill me, Jack, no jar.</v>

135
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.400
That's why booth. My name is all wrong.

136
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.100
No child wants to play with a Charlie in the bar.

137
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.080
<v 1>Philosopher, NSL mezze calls this process, biopolitical abandonment,</v>

138
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.310
the process by which people who refuse to conduct themselves properly placed

139
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:02.290
themselves outside of the population.

140
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.070
And thus are no longer deemed worthy of society's care or protection.

141
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.050
The CoreLogic of biopolitics as cell mezze notes co is not only the

142
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:14.260
fostering of some forms of life, but the disavowal of others,

143
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.800
even to the point of death like that weird team building exercise.

144
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:20.590
When you have to pretend you and your coworkers are stuck in a life raft,

145
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.530
then you have to awkwardly decide who doesn't get a life preserver as you sink

146
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:28.130
to your watery grave. By the only one who did that is weird. Cause I,

147
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:30.850
I said me and then everyone just got really sad,

148
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.180
but I thought I was taking one for the team. I don't work there anymore.

149
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.800
In the case of the misfit toys,

150
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.220
that means being abandoned to some weird leper colony, but Hey,

151
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.800
Rudolph is about how this stuff is bad.

152
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.460
The film has a happy ending in which everyone apologizes to Rudolph and Hermie

153
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:47.320
for treating them so poorly. If anything,

154
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.820
Rudolph is the celebration of the things that make us different, right? Well,

155
00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:52.240
yes.

156
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.580
And that makes it even more interesting that's because it only shows us how bio

157
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:58.230
politics manages deviancy,

158
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.290
but how it can end up incorporating first and foremost,

159
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.660
it's important to note that when Rudolph finally comes back,

160
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.890
nothing is different. He's still the object of scorn.

161
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.070
<v 4>Hey look, who's back on neon. Now.</v>

162
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.260
<v 1>The pressing Santa seems to only care about Rudolph's return. And so far,</v>

163
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.500
has it benefits his mission with Rudolph's father out looking for him.

164
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.600
Santa will be down a worker, come Christmas.

165
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.590
<v 3>Christmas Eve is only two days off without your father.</v>

166
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.680
I'll never be able to get my sleep off the ground.

167
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.270
<v 1>Maybe most depressingly still Rudolph is only hailed as a hero.</v>

168
00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:36.110
When the very nose that he was vilified for, it becomes socially useful.

169
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.100
Suddenly Rudolph goes from being a non-productive body to being a hero.

170
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.970
<v 3>I knew that nos would be useful someday. I knew it all wrong.</v>

171
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.140
<v 1>Information from scorned to misfit to savior of Christmas can best be understood</v>

172
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:52.430
as a rehabilitation or what Mitchell and Snyder call a productive process of

173
00:09:52.431 --> 00:09:56.480
recovery leading to a return to employment in the activities of civic life.

174
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.260
In other words, rehabilitation amounts to an economic transformation.

175
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.680
And it's one that all the misfits undergo in this film. For example,

176
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.460
you kind of Cornelius claims that he's reformed the now toothless abominable

177
00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:08.210
snowman.

178
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.630
<v 3>I, for him, this Bumble, he wants a job.</v>

179
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.650
<v 4>The skirt.</v>

180
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.160
<v 1>The North.</v>

181
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.550
Now the monster is toothless and capable of being assimilated into the

182
00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:20.810
biopolitical order.

183
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.130
And then there are the misfit toys after Sante confidently promises to find

184
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:26.600
children who would want to play with them.

185
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.380
<v 3>Rudolph. I promise as soon as this storm lets up,</v>

186
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.950
I'll find homes for all those misfit toys.

187
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.360
<v 1>Misfit toys see an elevation in their social status and short because Santa's</v>

188
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:38.820
decreed it.

189
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.130
So they're wanted again and to such they're reintroduced into society.

190
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.950
<v 3>Beyond our way. Finally.</v>

191
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.740
<v 1>There's Hermie who finds himself rehabilitated.</v>

192
00:10:48.741 --> 00:10:52.070
When the head elf apparently realizing the cavities are a thing,

193
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.290
allows him to open his own dental practice.

194
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.930
<v 3>I bet they set up an appointment for you a week from Fugazi.</v>

195
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.890
<v 1>Then is the logic of bio politics expelled a nonproductive,</v>

196
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.370
or at least abandoned them. If you can normalize them,

197
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.120
take away their teeth and rough edges so they can become a productive member of

198
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:10.730
society. However, society defines that,

199
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.290
but biopower is a technology and one that's always shifting. So yes,

200
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.260
your tooth fetish, might've made you a freak a few months ago,

201
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.930
but now that we can put it to use walkable Baird,

202
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.580
the same applies to Rudolph's nose,

203
00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:25.280
which once they realize it can help Santa navigate,

204
00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:28.520
the snowstorm suddenly becomes highly valuable.

205
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.250
It reflects the ongoing process in the real world,

206
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.210
in which behaviors and attributes that were once labeled deviant can be

207
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:37.160
assimilated into the productive order.

208
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.060
People once thought incorrectly that gay people were a threat to the social

209
00:11:41.061 --> 00:11:43.220
fabric, particularly in the army.

210
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.570
But once the military realized that they could be drone pilots to inclusion

211
00:11:47.571 --> 00:11:50.450
became a strength. And so like Rudolph's red nose,

212
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.060
different categories of so-called deviance be accepted into the social order on

213
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:56.620
account of their differences.

214
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.700
But what do you guys think is Christmas down actually a utopia where everyone

215
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:04.120
can contribute with their own unique traits or is this classic Christmas tale

216
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.840
actually a grim demonstration of how biopower functions in the modern world.

217
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.490
