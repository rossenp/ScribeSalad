00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>This episode is brought to you by movie.</v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.110
<v 1>What's up guys, Michael here with a new episode of book versus film. Today,</v>

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.590
we want to chat about one of literature and cinema's greatest heroes,

4
00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:19.970
a true mensch kind of guy. You can really root for just kidding.

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.310
We're talking American psycho.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.850
And of course the titular psycho Patrick Bateman,

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.560
both the film and novel having gendered serious controversy author, Bret Easton,

8
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.590
Ellis received a numerous death threats after the book's publication.

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.850
And Leonardo DiCaprio was talked out of starting in the film by feminist

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.320
activists, Gloria Steinem, and both versions are provocative, brutally violent,

11
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:43.700
and often quite funny.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.920
<v 0>I'm into, uh, uh, murders and executions. Mostly. Do you like it? Well,</v>

13
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.620
it depends why. Well,

14
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:56.600
most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions really don't like it.

15
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.800
<v 1>But there are also two very distinct works and their differences can affect the</v>

16
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:01.910
way we interpret them.

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.030
What's more the differences raise some pretty cool questions.

18
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.410
Like is the book boring on purpose or what happens to the meaning of a scene

19
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:12.890
when you flipped a perspective? So instead of comparing business cards,

20
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.070
let's compare American psycho books versus film.

21
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.650
And obviously spoilers ahead for both.

22
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.010
Let's start by looking at the similarities,

23
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.800
both follow the same fundamental timeline,

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.430
which sees label obsessed has a for a good business card.

25
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.690
Yuppie Patrick Bateman,

26
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.070
as he goes from saying and thinking violent things to living his very best

27
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:38.000
serial killer life. He takes out his anger on unhoused people, sex workers,

28
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.610
and the occasional wealthy foe. In the meantime,

29
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:44.270
he has a complete meltdown and pretends to snag a reservation at Dorsia.

30
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.810
<v 0>We're totally booked. Really? That's great. No,</v>

31
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.070
I said we are totally booked two at nine. Perfect. See you then.

32
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.860
<v 1>On top of the same basic trajectory,</v>

33
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.690
many of the films best moments are cribbed directly from the novel from Bateman.

34
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:04.280
Losing is over arrivals business card to his confused homoerotic encounter to

35
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.130
some choice quotes about women. If they have a good point.

36
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.100
<v 0>Personality and they're not great looking and who cares?</v>

37
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.280
Just say hypothetically, okay, what if they have a good personality?

38
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.790
I know, I know there are no girls with good personalities.

39
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.190
<v 1>But of course, if they were carbon copies,</v>

40
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:25.340
this video would be over and you'd be very bored. Well,

41
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:28.880
there are plenty of things. The movie leaves out, presumably for time,

42
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.030
we're talking about the changes that feel most important,

43
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.700
which brings us to the differences.

44
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.780
We spent a lot of time picking apart American psycho to find these comparisons.

45
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.340
There is nothing we love more than a movie that requires some over analization.

46
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.640
It's one of the best parts about movie going. And if you feel the same,

47
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.230
then we think you should check out this week.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.930
Now back to the show difference, number one, the violence,

65
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.070
most conversations about American psycho inevitably revolve around the violence.

66
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.230
So let's start there. Well,

67
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:56.040
both the film and the novel have plenty to offer any fan of gory horror.

68
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.540
There's really no comparison.

69
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.060
The violence in the novel is by our rough estimates,

70
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.830
at least 650%, more horrifying, more explicit,

71
00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:09.720
more creative and more innocence destroying than the film on

72
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:10.290
screen.

73
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.370
Much of the violence is alluded to a woman will disappear and then reappear on

74
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:15.720
screen with a bloody nose.

75
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.600
Blood will splatter as a victim is impaled in the face,

76
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.460
but we won't actually see that port base or Patrick will lovingly finger a

77
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:25.470
lock of hair of one of his presumed victims,

78
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.120
like a total freak by contrast Eastern Allison's depictions of the most deranged

79
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:30.840
violence.

80
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.950
The worst of which is reserved for women attack you in your poor brain,

81
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.710
like your,

82
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.810
the one being hit in the head with a nail gun Bateman tortures his victims with

83
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.653
steak knives,

84
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.180
rips many eyeballs out of many sockets and cooks one of his victims into a human

85
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:47.430
sausage while sobbing and says,

86
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.310
I can't tell them from cooking any of this correctly

87
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.150
because I'm crying too hard.

88
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.700
And I never really cooked anything before to be clear,

89
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.770
he's talking about a human body. Oh,

90
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:05.460
and he also tries to mail these shriveled heart of another victim to her mom,

91
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.450
and also stabs a child and pushes his dying body behind a garbage can.

92
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.400
And that's not even the worst of it.

93
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.060
It's just what we think might not get as the monetized,

94
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.260
the comparatively toned down violence in the film seems like a reasonable

95
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:22.620
change. Film is a much more stimulating medium.

96
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.970
There are things we can tolerate in written form that might just be too much for

97
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:29.850
us on screen director, Mary Heron and screenwriter,

98
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:32.790
Gwen of your Turner were meticulous about it. Calibrating,

99
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:36.960
what types of violence counted as satire versus exploitation?

100
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.020
And what point does he a woman's body harmed on screen?

101
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:45.000
Stop making a point and start making a really gross and troubling statement.

102
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.580
However, there's an argument to be made though.

103
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.870
I'm not sure if I'm buying it that it's the book's violence that makes it so

104
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:55.440
effective as a skating commentary on 1980s, grievance,

105
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.460
superficial reality and rendering Bateman. So shocking.

106
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.280
So absurdly and deranged really violent.

107
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.040
The book ensures that we'll forgive him nothing.

108
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.250
While movie Bateman is gross and awful and very,

109
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.360
very disturbing his behavior doesn't even near the book standard of violence.

110
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.170
It's possible that the movie's relative restraint shielded the audience from

111
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:19.280
some of the books impact by concealing the worst of Bateman's violence and the

112
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:21.200
movie he's deranged. Sure.

113
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.270
But in the book he's positively inhuman someone we can't identify with.

114
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.890
And contrast movie Maven is still revered by certain corners of dude culture.

115
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.270
In 2005, a Bateman action figure was in high demand these days,

116
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.710
and I'm not making this up.

117
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.540
The Bateman skincare line has brought in masculine vanity to the masses and lots

118
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.450
of men, dream of imitating his well cloth ways.

119
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.480
We're not saying the books over the top violence is better,

120
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.550
especially if you don't want to spring for therapy.

121
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.410
After we're just saying that each works approach to the violence creates its own

122
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:57.650
unique meaning in the context of the narrative. Okay. Um,

123
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.580
enough about pan frying human flesh for one video because the violence,

124
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.140
isn't the only big difference.

125
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.100
If you've read the book you might've noticed it's well orange,

126
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.220
which brings us to difference. Number two,

127
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.610
the movie is enthralling and unlike away, Annabelle,

128
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.720
the book is often boring as hell on purpose.

129
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.100
Mary Harron's film adaptation as brisk pacing and is in academic terms,

130
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.950
a blast from beginning to end.

131
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.400
The book is something else entirely.

132
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.790
This 400 page screed is on Easton.

133
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.020
Ellis's part above all meant to be a skating take on a yuppie culture.

134
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.950
As a result. He wants you to hate this particular yuppie.

135
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.250
And as we mentioned before, in regards to human bratwurst,

136
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.290
he really succeeds by making Bateman not only 100% psychopath,

137
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.180
but also 100% boring as hell. The film might share some of the novels,

138
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:57.320
banal and comedic conversations about material wealth, but in the book,

139
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.860
Bateman becomes even more hateable with recurring passages,

140
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:05.540
documenting his superficial obsessions that are so boring as to be utterly

141
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:09.560
intolerable. Here, he is describing a Christmas party buffet.

142
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.390
A long folding table has been covered with a red tablecloth and is jammed with

143
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:19.010
pans and plates and bowls of roasted hazelnuts and lobster and oyster

144
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:23.510
bisques and celery root soup with apples and balloon caviar on toast points

145
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.800
and creamed onions and roast goosed with Chestnut stuffing.

146
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.630
<v 2>Don't worry. There's more.</v>

147
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.250
<v 1>And caviar and puff pastry and vegetable tarts with tapenade roast,</v>

148
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:36.080
duck and roast rack of veal.

149
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.970
<v 2>And the vegetables straight on all of our salad and scallops and bruschetta with</v>

150
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:41.050
marscapone and like triples.

151
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.570
<v 1>There's still more,</v>

152
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.770
but you get the picture and yell at us in the comments all you want,

153
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.320
but we know that you know,

154
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.030
that you were at least a little bored during that four page dissertation on

155
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.550
Whitney Houston being inside Patrick Bateman's head is a lot of things,

156
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.400
but it's at most points aggressively and decidedly.

157
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.350
Un-fun his obsession with the finer things in life is spiraled into something

158
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:09.060
completely deranged.

159
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.160
Sometimes that means diagramming every single designer behind every single piece

160
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:18.090
of clothing on every single person in this fancy,

161
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.250
new Southern California restaurant,

162
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.490
until you wish he would gouge your eyeballs out.

163
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.320
Sometimes that means reciting every single appliance or decoration in his sad,

164
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:29.880
expensive minimalist apartment.

165
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.380
And that always means describing every piece of fancy food on the table,

166
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.360
including the side dish condiments and some very Merry eighties or Bay flavors

167
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.681
and the film.

168
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:45.330
We get a fair amount of voiceover offering some insight into the complete and

169
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.610
utter banality of being Patrick Bateman.

170
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.370
<v 0>After I removed the ice pack,</v>

171
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.970
I use a deep pore cleanser lotion in the shower.

172
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.460
I use a water activated gel cleanser,

173
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.540
then a honey almond, Bonnie scrum.

174
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.710
<v 1>In both versions,</v>

175
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.640
his inner monologue spotlights the compulsive nature of someone who's unable to

176
00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:09.350
experience life beyond luxury, commodities, sex, and violence, but in the book,

177
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.640
there's no escaping that inner monologue more than anything.

178
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.330
This speaks to the relative freedom that fiction writers are given in comparison

179
00:10:17.331 --> 00:10:21.980
to screenwriters and filmmakers Easton Ellis can rant for seven and a half pages

180
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:23.420
about QB Lewis and the news,

181
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.290
but that's got to be condensed to a one and a half minutes still long feeling

182
00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:28.010
monologue.

183
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.450
As he prepares to acts his business rival film structure is for the most part,

184
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.590
much more rigid.

185
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.950
You've basically got to hit a compelling mid point by the end of the first hour.

186
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.570
It's almost impossible to have it more than 400 pages into two hours.

187
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.520
And it makes sense that the redundancies like the counting 15 references to

188
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.770
Donald Trump would be the first to go.

189
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.360
Instead of seemingly dozens of conversations about stuff like how to wear a vest

190
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.640
beneath the suit. We get an errant line.

191
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.610
<v 0>Now, John, you've got to wear clothes and proportions.</v>

192
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.690
<v 1>Instead of a good Jillian scenes fighting over reservations.</v>

193
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.780
We get a quick conversation. As a result, movie,

194
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.820
Bateman is more tolerable and much more entertaining in contrast being inside

195
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:15.620
Bateman's head for 400 pages reveals the absolute banality of yuppy

196
00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:19.790
existence in all its Armani drenched glory. However, Patrick Bateman,

197
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:23.660
isn't the only character in this sort of tale. What about the women?

198
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.620
Let's break it down. Difference. Number three, the female perspective.

199
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.820
It doesn't take a lot of reflection to realize that Patrick's malevolent has a

200
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:35.810
favorite target women, but through small changes in perspective,

201
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.040
the film was able to do things. The book, otherwise can't Easton Ellis,

202
00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:44.120
his novel is situated so deeply in the crevices of Patrick Bateman's disturbing

203
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:48.410
brain that there's no escaping his perspective. And when it comes to women,

204
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.470
let's just say that perspective is less than flattering.

205
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.870
The nicest thing he'll call a he's about to murder is a hard body,

206
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.730
which hopefully we don't have to explain to you is absolutely dehumanizing.

207
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.620
Whether he's feeding his fiance,

208
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.030
a urinal cake disguised as a good diamond chocolate or swearing at his ex,

209
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.020
as he maces her in the eyes while nailing her fingers to a piece of wood,

210
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.790
he displays nothing but to stain and scorn from 99.9% of women with

211
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:19.300
perhaps the exception of the secretary, Jean what's more,

212
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.560
the book's depiction of the women is overwhelmingly a mirror image of the men,

213
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.390
narcissistic, petty, and Craven, and their obsession with the material world.

214
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.050
However, while male superficial reality is the name of Bateman's game.

215
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.150
Hearing it from women really grinds his goat like Evelyn obsessing over her

216
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:41.230
Waldorf salad. They have the best Waldorf salad in town at the rainbow room.

217
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.250
Did you like mine? Did you like my Waldorf salad, honey,

218
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.030
these depictions necessarily make it harder to connect with the women.

219
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:53.830
Bateman wounds emotionally and physically his wrote dehumanizing descriptions of

220
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:57.130
either sexy or torturing women start to blur together.

221
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.870
In contrast to the film,

222
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.160
both written and directed by women treats the female characters different in

223
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:06.910
part, because we're somewhat free from the prison of Bateman's perspective. Now,

224
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.410
if you really pay attention,

225
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.970
you'll find that not a single male character says anything that isn't remarkably

226
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.080
petty, superficial, or narcissistic. They prattle on about sex, food,

227
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:21.190
and clothes to such access as the scene, completely devoid of personality.

228
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.320
In contrast the women in the film though,

229
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.810
displaying varying levels of superficial reality,

230
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.190
generally possess some emotional depth outside the prism of Bateman's narration.

231
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.320
This allows us to genuinely feel for them.

232
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.860
There's Evelyn watching her relationship fall apart in slow motion.

233
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.100
<v 0>Patrick, we should do it.</v>

234
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.130
Do get married, have a wedding. No, I can't take the tunnel for it.

235
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.640
<v 1>And wondering out loud by Bateman's and capable of feeling.</v>

236
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.450
<v 0>No I'm in, I'm in touch with humanity.</v>

237
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.860
<v 1>The book, this exchange is annoying for Bateman who tells us to me,</v>

238
00:13:55.861 --> 00:13:57.420
she looks like a big black ant,

239
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.250
a big black ant and an original Christian LaCroix eating a urinal

240
00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:04.380
cake. And I almost start laughing.

241
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.360
But in the film we genuinely feel for American icon Reese Witherspoon.

242
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.680
And of course there's Jean who adores Bateman with a startling innocence in both

243
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.340
iterations while all of these basic narratives exist in the novel.

244
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.450
They're so filtered through.

245
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.070
Bateman's that we simply can't feel for the women the way we do in the film.

246
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.060
But the character who is most interesting to us is Christie right before her

247
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:28.410
first threesome with Bateman,

248
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.100
she exchanges a look with the other sex worker that demonstrates their mutual

249
00:14:32.101 --> 00:14:36.210
scorn for him. While that look is described in the novel, it's again,

250
00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:37.680
filtered through Patrick's view.

251
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.000
He doesn't actually pick up on the extent to which these ladies hate him.

252
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.930
The second time Kristy goes back to his apartment, accepting his generous check.

253
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.650
Presumably out of desperation, the book describes her as cautious,

254
00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:52.760
scared and impassive. However, in the film,

255
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:57.320
her solid performance and deadly glare are uncomfortable to watch here.

256
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:01.010
We see what she likely felt in the book. I hatred for Bateman,

257
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:04.820
that he was too self-centered to even notice, but it's one onscreen.

258
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.871
Christy is murdered.

259
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:09.140
That things get really tragic and cinematically interesting.

260
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.890
And then novel she's brutally tortured in ways so shocking that we will

261
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:16.040
unfortunately remember them on our deathbeds in the film.

262
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.070
Things happen very differently. Now at an earlier moment,

263
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:22.310
we see Patrick doing sit-ups while lodging, Texas chainsaw massacre,

264
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.400
which is for sure, totally normal and chill thing to do,

265
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.600
but it's also a slight reference to what Christie's death will look like in the

266
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:32.990
book. Christy is tied up in gag while Patrick kills the other member of their

267
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.040
threesomes and the film she realizes he's attacking the other woman promptly

268
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:39.320
leaps up and tries to get the hell out.

269
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.430
What follows her running from Bateman and his chainsaw is shot quite similarly

270
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:45.530
to this moment in that iconic horror film,

271
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.570
where the protagonist runs for her life.

272
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.630
Also trying to escape a madman with a chainsaw.

273
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.850
So for a brief moment in the film,

274
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.670
we are completely immersed in Christie's Headspace.

275
00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.260
We can completely empathize with it and we desperately want to see her escape

276
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.200
perhaps more so than any character in the film.

277
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.730
Christie is a real person who sees Bateman for what he really is humanizing

278
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:11.000
Bateman's victim. This way is a powerful statement on Heron's part.

279
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.570
And it's a larger reason that many consider this film to be subversively

280
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:16.670
feminist, despite popular backlash,

281
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.530
Heron forces us to acknowledge Christie's humanity to tragic effect. Of course,

282
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.340
that is if you believe that Patrick Bateman serial killing really happened,

283
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.450
which brings us to difference. Number four reality.

284
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.410
One of the lingering questions about American psycho is whether or not this

285
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:37.580
whole killing spree happened in real life for took place in Bateman's rapidly,

286
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:38.660
disintegrating psyche,

287
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.250
obviously both the film and novel share the clue that Paul Allen is apparently

288
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:44.120
alive and well.

289
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.950
This clue is a little more suspect in the novel because everyone is constantly

290
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:50.570
confusing. Male identities,

291
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:55.220
which happens just a few salient times in the film in both versions though, it,

292
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:58.850
at least it feels possible that the lawyer merely had dinner with someone who

293
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.360
looks like Paul Allen also volts share a creepy moment.

294
00:17:02.361 --> 00:17:06.080
When Patrick goes to cleanup Allen's apartment and meets an intimidating real

295
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:10.880
estate agent who tells Patrick to go away and don't make any travel plays in the

296
00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:11.330
film.

297
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.990
This is as close as we get to a clue that somebody knows what he's been up to

298
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.680
compounded with the chilling suspicion that this real estate agent covered up

299
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:21.950
his murders to more easily sell the apartment. However,

300
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.940
there's one scene in the book that is far more revealing in it.

301
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.200
Bateman's cab driver recognizes him and calls him out as the madman who killed a

302
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.580
fellow cabby named salty.

303
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.390
He also reports that Bateman's face is on a wanted poster downtown,

304
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.340
this literal confrontation,

305
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.800
no one time somebody looks him in the eye and accuses him of being a murderer is

306
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:45.490
powerful in the novel. Bateman says, I feel naked.

307
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.830
Suddenly tiny. My mouth tastes metallic then gets worse.

308
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.610
Literally Bateman is cut down to size when faced with accusations about his

309
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.444
behavior,

310
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.290
the cabbie then holds up a gun and Rob's Bateman of his precious Rolex.

311
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:03.180
And Wayfair's informing him that there is no monetary reward being offered for

312
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:07.200
turning him in. It's interesting. This scene is again,

313
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.580
scathing commentary.

314
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.720
The cabbie's moral indignation is overridden by his desire for expensive

315
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:15.390
material goods. He could try to turn Bateman in,

316
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.820
but there's no financial incentive to do that.

317
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.080
So he doesn't bother pretty dark, but more importantly,

318
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.340
this scene does a lot of work to suggest that Bateman's killings are real and

319
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:28.950
that he could face consequences for his actions.

320
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.520
The movie doesn't have this scene, and that really matters. In fact,

321
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:35.970
it contributes to the reasonable belief among some fans that the killings are

322
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.430
actually all in Patrick's head. Eastern.

323
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:40.140
Alice has said that he's not sure himself.

324
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.700
However Heron has said Patrick was definitely a serial killer though.

325
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.480
Some of the movies more outrageous events were intended to be ambiguous that

326
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.070
said Heron has commented that her biggest regret was people keep coming out of

327
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:54.810
the film, thinking that it's all a dream.

328
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:59.070
And I never intended that the cabbie stealing a Rolex scene in the book makes

329
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.450
Bateman's murderous, inclinations, less ambiguous, and pretty much assures us.

330
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.290
At least the Patrick's murder spree has some basis in reality.

331
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.280
And speaking of Rolex's, that brings us to difference number five,

332
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.870
the Rolex in the novel Bateman makes more than two dozen references to his

333
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:17.820
beloved Rollings. However,

334
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.780
apparently Rolex wasn't so cool with being the favorite watch of cinema's most

335
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:25.830
hideous serial killer, and wouldn't sign off on any references. As a result,

336
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.660
the movie doesn't contain a single utterance of that most sacred word Rolex

337
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.310
rather when one woman reaches for Patrick's hand, he merely says, touch the,

338
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:36.990
watch this though.

339
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:41.610
It seems incidental is actually super important because nah,

340
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.331
just kidding.

341
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:45.870
It's just a fun piece of trivia with absolutely no bearing on the plot.

342
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.330
So Sue us. But what do you guys think?

343
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.230
Do these differences change their respective meanings of the film in the book,

344
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.430
which is better? Or is that a dumb question? Because each is unique.

345
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.550

applying an anti-aging Ibom and be sure to ring that bell as always.

349
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.340
