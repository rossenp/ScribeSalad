00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.640
<v 0>This video is brought to you by movie mavens.</v>

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.810
What's up wisecrack Michael here today, I come to you with a simple question.

3
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.890
<v 1>Who lives in a pineapple.</v>

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.330
<v 0>That's right. We're talking about SpongeBob square pants, perhaps.</v>

5
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:22.850
No animated children's show is dominated culture.

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.060
Quite like SpongeBob has running for 21 years. Straight.

7
00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:29.570
SpongeBob is a juggernaut that has captured the hearts of children, teenagers,

8
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:34.400
adults, and of course yours truly, which brings us to the real question at hand.

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.570
Why,

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.740
how is SpongeBob square pants able to speak to the existential concerns of both

11
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:44.690
recently potty trained toddlers and meme obsessed 30 somethings while we can

12
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:46.810
bring up the show's pension for double entendre?

13
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.630
<v 1>Yeah. Genius is showing and it's exciting.</v>

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.800
<v 0>Oppressive animation.</v>

15
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.040
We think the answer is rooted in something more sociological,

16
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.570
the concept of childhood.

17
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.050
So join me for this wisecrack addition on SpongeBob square pants.

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.250
And before we continue,

19
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.890

back to the show. Now,

36
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.940
for those of you who haven't spring break in bikini bottom,

37
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:54.410
here's the deal essentially.

38
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.070
ANSI sponge lives in an undersea pineapple and spends his days getting up to

39
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:01.640
hi-jinks with this starfish, pal Patrick, while holding down a job as a fry,

40
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:03.350
cook much hilarity ensues.

41
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.120
<v 1>High demand, and Trent and a year club on the grounds that I am not a weenie.</v>

42
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.850
How's it going? You were saying.

43
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.080
<v 0>To make sense of SpongeBob's enduring legacy. We need to talk about childhood,</v>

44
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.100
the concept of childhood as being a special time in our lives during which we

45
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:20.210
need to be nurtured, loved,

46
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:24.020
and fed bagel bites while playing Mario kart is a relatively new phenomenon.

47
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.920
As we've noted in a previous video, that's not to say that in the good old days,

48
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:31.310
children weren't loved just that this love often came with a hardhat and a

49
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:34.100
Canary, according to a story and Felipe areas,

50
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.670
our awareness of the particular nature of childhood developed in the Western

51
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:41.420
consciousness over various stages. Back in medieval times, for example,

52
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.940
children reviewed essentially as adults and miniature,

53
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.770
who were able to hold gainful employment,

54
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.360
joined the convent and even get engaged at the tender age of seven fast forward

55
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:51.800
a few hundred years to Puritan times,

56
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:55.640
and children reviewed more as the property of God who were very much at risk of

57
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:57.950
being led astray by the red guy down stairs,

58
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.860
consequently needed to scare the crap out of them to keep them in line by the

59
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.120
late 19th century areas are used along with the rise of psychology and universal

60
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:07.954
education.

61
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.260
We start to see our modern view of childhood one in which children are to be

62
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:14.770
guided past to various developmental and educational milestones.

63
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.370
And this is where one Robert's Squarepants comes in. See,

64
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.300
most of today's children's media is built upon these modern views of childhood.

65
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.800
These stories target highly specific age groups using characters and storylines

66
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:30.460
that map to their demographics development and education. In other words,

67
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.820
whether it's Daniel Tiger's neighborhood or everyone's favorite football head

68
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.710
storylines, usually to pick characters,

69
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:37.510
dealing with the typical problems problems,

70
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:40.240
which can be mapped along to the real life development of the children.

71
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.620
<v 1>How you feel when you can't see your friends.</v>

72
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.720
<v 0>You know, lessons about taking turns</v>

73
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.340
Or dealing with bullies by going full karate kid,

74
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.950
But SpongeBob square pants rips up this playbook entirely for one,

75
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:09.180
the sponge guy himself is rather ambiguously aged while his driver's license

76
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.110
pigs, him as initially 13 years old, he bears many marks of adulthood.

77
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.950
He lives on his own as a full-time job and takes care of his pet snail.

78
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.440
Incidentally, according to this metric,

79
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:23.670
I am 66.6% in adult. Moreover, many of the shows,

80
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:26.100
storylines aren't exactly aimed at kids.

81
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.860
<v 1>Who was flickering the lights.</v>

82
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.170
<v 0>Exactly your typical kitty fair. At the same time.</v>

83
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.980
SpongeBob is definitely a kid at heart. He loves blowing bubbles. Camp passes.

84
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.590
<v 1>No, no, no. Don't</v>

85
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.970
[inaudible] embodies kid like naivete.

86
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.320
One time I tried this magician and he hit this thing anyway.

87
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.700
And then he told us if you believe in yourself and the

88
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.190
magic dreams can come.

89
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.830
<v 0>This paradox is intentional.</v>

90
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.580
The creators Steven Hillenburg pushed back when Nickelodeon wanted to overly

91
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.270
kitify SpongeBob by making them attend school. According to Hillenburg,

92
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.720
the network actually wanted to make the show, Hey, Arnold, under the seat,

93
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.350
something the world surely does not need. Interestingly,

94
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.700
by making SpongeBob and explicitly unconventional blur between child and adult

95
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.180
Hillenburg gets to explore various historical conceptions of childhood.

96
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.021
For example,

97
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:37.890
our naive SpongeBob often embodies the Puritan model of a child that needs to be

98
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:40.830
scared straight from any mischief. In one episode,

99
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.180
Mr. Krabs Warrens are wide-eyed protagonist about the danger of the hooks.

100
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.350
<v 1>They dangle down and draw your close with them,</v>

101
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.880
bees and shapes and they're beguiling. And just when you think your home,

102
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.640
the land of milk and honey, they crap you by the British and hurry up, wait,

103
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.130
wait, wait, wait, wait, what is happening?

104
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.780
And then they cook it and then they eat. Ya are worse. Yikes.

105
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.100
<v 0>This horrifying slash dramatic speech parallels,</v>

106
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:13.480
many popular old school Puritan teachings about kids falling into sin creature.

107
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:14.950
Thomas Brooks, for example,

108
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.600
issued a similar warning to kids about a scary pit of sin. Writing that key,

109
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:23.890
who will be so bold as to attempt to dance upon the brink of the pit may find by

110
00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:27.880
woeful experience that it is a righteous thing with God that he should fall into

111
00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:31.540
the pit pit or hook both warnings, bear nightmare,

112
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.000
inducing implications for your average tight,

113
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.900
but SpongeBob draws on more than just a Puritan conception of childhood.

114
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.620
Arguably, anytime SpongeBob Don says Krusty Krab uniform,

115
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.700
he's being seen as a little laborer embodying the medieval conception of

116
00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:49.390
childhood SpongeBob is absorbed with his work and obsessed with his perpetual

117
00:06:49.391 --> 00:06:50.350
status as employees.

118
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.260
<v 1>Yeah. The month Mr. Cramps gave you that award.</v>

119
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:57.520
So you'll work harder for no extra money. That is not true. Squidward. Hey,

120
00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:01.330
gives it to me because I work harder. You can win it too. If you tried harder.

121
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.290
Our Intrepid.

122
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.060
<v 0>Fry cook oblivious to his own exploitation is willing to do anything for his job</v>

123
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.600
and is easily goated into destroying his friendship and the fry cook game.

124
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.420
<v 1>Don't forget the code yellow</v>

125
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.800
like innocent.

126
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.160
<v 0>[Inaudible] medieval child nun. SpongeBob's job is all important.</v>

127
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.140
The show like most children's television sometimes also embraces a more modern

128
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:29.770
perspective on childhood showing SpongeBob, dealing with developmental issues,

129
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:33.100
like learning to tie his shoes and realizing that stealing is bad.

130
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.420
<v 1>We have the good first. Are you out of your mind,</v>

131
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.280
do video, do what they do to people like us. We're not talking about

132
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.320
[inaudible] hi, Jackie, here.

133
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.880
They're going to lock us up.

134
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.081
<v 0>Indeed.</v>

135
00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:53.710
The network seems to have eventually sort of gotten its way and that SpongeBob

136
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.240
like your average kid does occasionally go to school, albeit a boating school.

137
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.910
This setting allows sponge about to encounter issues.

138
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:03.520
More typical to children's shows things like cheating.

139
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.420
<v 1>I know, right? You can change.</v>

140
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.603
[inaudible] cheap that way.

141
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.490
<v 0>Now, big caveat. We're not saying that by making SpongeBob's age fluid,</v>

142
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:19.660
Hillenburg intentionally meant to explore areas as a historical model childhood.

143
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.411
Rather,

144
00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:23.860
it seems that by letting SpongeBob move seamlessly between the domains of

145
00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:25.930
childhood and adulthood, along with histories,

146
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.910
various views surrounding these realms,

147
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.330
Hillenburg allows the show to speak to kids and adults. At the same time,

148
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.750
the kids get to watch SpongeBob gleefully break the rules while parents can

149
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:36.820
crack a smile with the double meaning of the word.

150
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.680
<v 1>Hooky, we're going to go play.</v>

151
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.630
<v 0>Just some jokes, address kids and adults at the same time.</v>

152
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.290
Like when Patrick teaches SpongeBob, how to act like a grownup to impress him.

153
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.820
<v 1>Grandma, what are you going to tell grandma? I'm a grownup, no ifs,</v>

154
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.910
ands or buts about it. A man's got to do what a man's got to

155
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.050
push Patrick. We didn't say that something.

156
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.840
<v 0>Tells me the little kids aren't quite registering the grand matricide joke here.</v>

157
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.070
This ability to address multiple audiences at once. Didn't start with SpongeBob.

158
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.641
Rather.

159
00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:13.850
It's an aspect of children's literature and media dating back to the 18th

160
00:09:13.851 --> 00:09:16.460
century. According to scholar, Kimberly Reynolds,

161
00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:18.710
when publishers began printing children's books,

162
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.500
they realized they had to satisfy the demands of two markets.

163
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.380
The kids that consume the stories and the parents that buy them.

164
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.420
According to author Barbara Wall,

165
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.900
having to satisfy two distinct audiences and a single text,

166
00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:33.740
often leads writers to variously employed three distinctive narrative styles.

167
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.760
First there's the double address. When the narrator talks over the child,

168
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:41.630
addressing the adult in the room, think Patrick's joke about killing grandma.

169
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.200
Then there's the single address. When the narrator talks solely to the child,

170
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.680
think of those gross out closeups, that SpongeBob employees,

171
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.350
things that get the kids laughing, but aren't exactly Whitney.

172
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.230
<v 1>Beautiful how beautiful the [inaudible].</v>

173
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.150
<v 0>Okay. Some of them are pretty good,</v>

174
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.750
which by wall's definition would make them examples of the third narrative style

175
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.370
dual address or talking to both children and adults simultaneously while other

176
00:10:07.371 --> 00:10:10.880
children's properties may both separately and duly address kids and adults.

177
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.200
SpongeBob's ability to seamlessly switch between all three narrative styles is

178
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:18.860
what makes it so special. But why is SpongeBob so unique in this way?

179
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.760
Why don't we find jokes about doing drugs or killing loved ones or watching porn

180
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.020
in other children's media?

181
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.350
<v 1>I was just looking for this bites, gentle Gavin.</v>

182
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.180
<v 0>And why don't we get as many feel, good,</v>

183
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:35.060
silly moments that adults and kids can both enjoy?

184
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:39.430
<v 1>Well.</v>

185
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.850
<v 0>The answer might surprise you.</v>

186
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.460
It's not that other children's media can't do this.

187
00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:45.770
It's just that a lot of it intentionally doesn't.

188
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.520
This is because most of the children's media landscape is dominated by one

189
00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:53.330
company and it's single idea of childhood. Any way you slice it.

190
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.870
Disney has had a monopoly on children's media for the past century.

191
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.890
The company is almost single-handedly lobbied to change copyright laws so that

192
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.550
its iconic franchises wouldn't enter the public domain and it's gobbled up

193
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.930
almost all of its closest competition. Buying the likes of Pixar, Lucas films,

194
00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:12.200
Marvel, and 21st century Fox Disney's choke hold on.

195
00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:13.940
Modern culture is so strong.

196
00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:18.620
Both for children and adults that eight of the top 10 grossing films in 2019

197
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:23.150
were made by the big mouse. And the creepy thing for almost a hundred years,

198
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:27.980
Disney has relentlessly pursued the same single vision of childhood cuteness,

199
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.510
you know, lovable kind characters with big round eyes. In other words,

200
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.650
everything that SpongeBob is not. In fact,

201
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.550
Walt Disney was so aggressive in his pursuit of all things cute that he made

202
00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:44.390
numerous enemies out of both his own animators and critics, scholar,

203
00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:48.500
David forecasts details how Disney's pushed to make the seven dwarves as cute as

204
00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:52.310
possible. Contra the source material created massive opposition,

205
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.320
even leading the animators to draw pornographic depictions of the characters and

206
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:59.650
protest depictions that for scholarly purposes,

207
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.380
we wish that survived. But as Chilean SAS and ex Disney kid,

208
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.500
Ariel Dorfman explains the mouse's soul, his desire to make all things cute.

209
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:11.260
Wasn't simply born out of an obsession with SaaS horizon.

210
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.650
It was part of a larger cultural package. Disney was selling to the world,

211
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.180
children in Disney's construction, live in a state of pure Eden like innocence,

212
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.580
which was reflected in the aesthetic of the cartoons.

213
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.720
This aesthetic Dorfman contends would be used to sugarcoat any ugly truth.

214
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.550
Disney wanted to sell from less bad things like the nuclear family to very bad

215
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:34.210
things like colonialism case in point is this infamous comic book in which

216
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:38.110
Donald Duck's nephews visit places like Aztec land and Inca Blinko racialized

217
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.080
parodies of central and South America only to find the natives,

218
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.590
their simple-minded savages who willingly give away their treasures.

219
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.710
But what does this all have to do with SpongeBob? Well,

220
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.130
just as Disney has been promoting a very specific brand of childhood.

221
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.420
So two is Nickelodeon and at least partially in reaction to Disney's reign of

222
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.410
innocent DOAs.

223
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.490
But whereas Disney's brand is based on perpetuating a particular myth of what

224
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:04.390
childhood is Nickelodeon's brand is based on giving children more agency.

225
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.050
According to Linda, Semanski a producer at Nickelodeon during the heyday,

226
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.230
the network was groundbreaking in that it rigorously focused,

227
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:14.530
tested each show on children. If kids didn't like to show it,

228
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:16.720
wouldn't be picked up in Symansky's view.

229
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.160
This all reinforced Nickelodeon's underlying philosophy that kids lived in a

230
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.590
grownup world and that it was tough to be a kid.

231
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:25.720
When you had to follow all the grownup rules,

232
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.100
unlike Disney Nickelodeon preach the gospel of childhood that believed kids

233
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:33.220
should be free to play around, have fun and stand up for themselves.

234
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.660
Whereas Disney bulked it,

235
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:38.500
anything that broke from its cute idealized form of childhood Nickelodeon

236
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:42.190
embraced everything from gross out humor to avant-garde animation styles,

237
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:46.390
to storylines far outside of your typical children's narrative. In other words,

238
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.140
a show like SpongeBob could only exist on a network like Nickelodeon.

239
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.020
It's strange Tiki inspired, aesthetic resembles,

240
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.900
and nothing of Disney's highly regimented animation style.

241
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.200
Not to mention all those weird moments in SpongeBob that break the fourth wall

242
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:01.750
with live action components, outlaw, patchy, the pirate.

243
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.410
And let's not forget about all the gross out closeups and adult topics in the

244
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:10.270
show. I mean really this series broached the topic of gay marriage in 2002.

245
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.320
That's not to make Nickelodeon out to be some kind of mom and pop animation shop

246
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.740
after all it's owned by Viacom and empire in and of itself,

247
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.880
presumably just as eager as Disney to make a buck. And that,

248
00:14:20.881 --> 00:14:24.850
that brings us to an aspect that area's never really delved into the way our

249
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:27.910
modern conception of childhood has been shaped by consumerism.

250
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.080
SpongeBob offers children something more robust than Disney's bland vision of

251
00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:36.370
childhood. So much of it is about transgression SpongeBob. Isn't a kid,

252
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:39.490
but he's not quite an adult. He drifts between hyper competence.

253
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.370
<v 1>First I dropped his head. Then I erased some of the more detailed features and</v>

254
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.380
I thought gold thingy, incompetence.

255
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.180
[inaudible].

256
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.430
<v 0>Whaling humor of bounds as well as a whole episode,</v>

257
00:15:00.431 --> 00:15:01.600
devoted to the concept of courage.

258
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.340
<v 1>Crabs is,</v>

259
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.810
do you kiss your mother with that mouth?

260
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:08.680
<v 0>Wait,</v>

261
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.550
Nickelodeon is offering kids greater agency by letting them test boundaries

262
00:15:12.551 --> 00:15:14.950
through an underwater sponges. Kind of like them,

263
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.940
not as much a pure child as companies like Disney would have you believe,

264
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.750
but not full adults either. And because we live under capitalism,

265
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.970
if kids feel empowered to buy a SpongeBob ice cream bars are results more,

266
00:15:27.971 --> 00:15:29.920
the better in the case of SpongeBob,

267
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.430
this more empowering vision of childhood certainly has been successful.

268
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.653
What's more,

269
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.960
we've contend that it's the very reason your Twitter feed continues to be

270
00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:42.460
dominated by SpongeBob meets means often made by the very adults who grew up

271
00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:44.140
with bikini bottom in the first place,

272
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.720
while the memes are diverse and fully glorious,

273
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.130
they tend overwhelmingly to take the form of reaction means this suggests a

274
00:15:51.131 --> 00:15:54.820
level of identification between the person sharing the meme and the character,

275
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.180
whether we're talking about going into beast mode or feeling confused when

276
00:15:58.181 --> 00:16:02.560
people comfort us while SpongeBob's meme ability has a ton to do with the shows

277
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.240
invented visual storytelling,

278
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.450
the lasting appeal of these images suggest something deeper,

279
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.680
perhaps that SpongeBob endures for us precisely because of the fluidity of its

280
00:16:11.681 --> 00:16:16.390
characters and the freedom they gave us to just be kids without being children.

281
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.460
But what do you guys is SpongeBob or regulatory depiction of childhood or is

282
00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:26.230
this face just impossible? Not to me, let us know in the comments. Huge,
