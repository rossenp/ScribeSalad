WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>So you started out in a different environment in public radio. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.350
so how was that experience for you?

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:09.090
I guess I was relatively early in your career.

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.850
<v 1>Yeah, I started, I, you know, right after college I had a, um,</v>

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.300
crisis of identity and I didn't know what I was going to do.

6
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:21.320
So I started all first and, and I'm working as a financial advisor for, for,

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.690
for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. And, um,

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.320
it was actually kind of during that miserable commute around the DC beltway,

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.520
I discovered public radio. And over a number of years,

10
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:35.120
I kind of set my sights on public radio because I realized that's really what I

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.340
wanted to be doing. I just loved the craft of it.

12
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:40.790
And I loved the way that they told stories.

13
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:44.690
I had never had a desire to go into TV. And, um,

14
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.350
I also didn't really do internships through college because I was, you know,

15
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.380
working full time and just a little bit lost in general.

16
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:53.840
So it wasn't until a while after college,

17
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:58.190
I discovered NPR and set my sights and I started at

18
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.360
NPR in 2002 and, um,

19
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.200
loved every day from, from the first minute.

20
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.191
<v 0>So,</v>

21
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:11.270
so you were attracted to NPR and I have to say when I was out there campaigning

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.200
around the country, NPR was like its own Oasis of news.

23
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:17.570
Like there were folks that listened to it. Uh,

24
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.260
the local NPR stations, uh,

25
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.470
seemed very free. They were very pure. You'd go in.

26
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:29.150
And they had listeners who really wanted a particular version of

27
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.120
both the news and the listening experience. Uh,

28
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.260
you were attracted to that and it sounds like you were there from 2002 to 2013

29
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:39.920
more or less. I mean, you were doing some other stuff, but it was all, uh,

30
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.820
public radio directed. Is that right? It's like 11 years or so.

31
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.040
<v 1>Yes, that's correct. Yeah. Um, and yeah, I mean, I just,</v>

32
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:53.300
this morning I was listening. I, you know, I listened to KQD frequently,

33
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:57.410
which is the San Francisco station. And, you know, it's, it's such a, you know,

34
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.240
pleasure because the, you know, the local, um, public affairs program forum,

35
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.440
they were, they covered, um, the local, um, uh,

36
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.830
drug overdose epidemic and how it's gotten worse through the pandemic.

37
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:14.660
And then they moved on to, um, the new COVID vaccines for another 30 minutes.

38
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:18.350
And it's this long in depth conversation and things that I didn't even know I

39
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:21.110
needed to know. But yeah, I mean, it's, it's,

40
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:25.340
it's just so much more and so such better information that you can get.

41
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.950
<v 0>Uh, NPR is supported through, um, public funding. Um, the,</v>

42
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.810
the NPR now has so many listeners and sponsors and advertisers that, uh, it's,

43
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.190
uh, largely self-sustaining and a lot of people have also donated to it. Um,

44
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.860
so it's like a combination. Um,

45
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.640
and then you wound up at MSNBC, which, uh, uh,

46
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.890
it seemed like your, uh,

47
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:55.550
experience was a bit different. Uh, how was the experience?

48
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.950
<v 1>I kind of came into it with the attitude. I mean,</v>

49
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:01.330
we knew that everything was kind of, you know, we knew that rating.

50
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.560
I knew that ratings, um, played a part and,

51
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.220
and our daily lives, um, I didn't understand the extent of it.

52
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.950
And I thought coming in,

53
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.540
I could bring my skills that I had in public radio.

54
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.680
And part of that is really trying to find new and

55
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.750
interesting and compelling stories and angles and voices,

56
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.300
and they would want to, you know, they would be,

57
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.180
they would welcome that because, uh,

58
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.130
in my mind I felt like one of my big criticisms of cable news coming into it

59
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:38.800
was the repetition. And when she said she felt like it was, you know,

60
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.360
you're watching the same five or six stories kind of all day throughout the day.

61
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.920
So, um,

62
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.870
I thought that that was an opportunity for me to come in and, you know,

63
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.020
make things better. Right. Um, so I,

64
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.820
I struggled with that for a few years. Um, I really, I, you know,

65
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:02.620
I tried different types of stories and kind of like strengthened my

66
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.850
pitches and, um, realize, okay, they might not listen to me the first time,

67
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.410
but I'll keep coming back and, you know,

68
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.420
trying to sell this other idea or strengthen my argument. Maybe they don't,

69
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.020
you know, maybe it's not intuitive, why something is a good idea.

70
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.780
And over time, I, you know, I, I got a little bit frustrated,

71
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:27.040
but, um, then started to get at the same times a little bit of seniority.

72
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:30.370
So I was more involved in the planning meetings, you know,

73
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:35.260
with the senior producer and the executive producer and,

74
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.630
or the senior producers. There's usually more than one.

75
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.850
And at that point I realized the extent that they really,

76
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.140
that the ratings really drove all of the decisions and it was,

77
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.460
it was it's down to, you know, it's the first thing out of their mouth.

78
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.220
As soon as you throw out an idea and they don't necessarily talk that way in the

79
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:57.070
wider editorial meetings with a full staff,

80
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.090
it really was in the S the smaller planning meetings. You know,

81
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.460
it's the first thing out of their mouth is like how things rated the night

82
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:06.940
before, how they thought something did. And those,

83
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.910
those ratings are broken down by quarter hours.

84
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:11.740
So they have a pretty good understanding of what did well and what didn't do

85
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.610
well. And so they will track the topics of course,

86
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.150
and they'll track the guests. You know, if, you know, if the guest does well,

87
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.610
or if aggress guest rates well or not,

88
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.720
they really rely on that, um,

89
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.340
for almost every decision. So, um, it that's,

90
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.870
it wasn't until the last few years when the reality,

91
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.760
um, became, you know, pretty stark to me. And then, you know, I,

92
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:42.760
wasn't going to be able to fight that fight. You know, there wasn't, you know,

93
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.900
these people are just doing their jobs and it's all out of their hands.

94
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.780
It's out of Lawrence's hands it's out of Phil Griffin's hand,

95
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.910
it's at a higher oil or pay level, um, where the, where the problems are,

96
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.580
you know, one of the things you said was that, look, these are good people.

97
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.060
<v 0>Uh, you know, trying to do good work, but, uh,</v>

98
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.140
they're put in a position where their job does not necessarily produce the kind

99
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:07.580
of journalism you'd want it to,

100
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.890
which is something I completely get and empathize with

101
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.450
is that if you put people in a position where their incentives are all steering

102
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:21.800
them one direction, you kind of expect them to end up, uh,

103
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.780
listening to those incentives. You know, it's like,

104
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:25.520
and if you don't listen to those incentives,

105
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:29.990
and let's say your ratings underperform, um, consistently,

106
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:31.880
then someone's going to make a change. And so, like,

107
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:35.840
that's the race you're always running. Um, like,

108
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.990
were there other people that ever expressed any misgiving,

109
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:41.270
maybe someone else from like a similar background as you.

110
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.680
<v 1>Yes. Um, those conversations didn't happen very often,</v>

111
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:50.290
but over the last year or two, when I was there,

112
00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:54.430
there were times when I would have conversations in private with other

113
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:59.050
producers. And, um, certainly they, you know,

114
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.320
with a couple of people, um,

115
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.930
they w said, I think we're making things worse, you know? Um,

116
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.110
some seem to think that w yeah,

117
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.100
what we're doing here is probably benefiting Trump and will,

118
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.780
would help him get elected. Again, the person who said we are a cancer, that is,

119
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.770
that's one of those conversations. It was somebody in the building, um,

120
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.830
uh, and has been in the business a long time. So, um,

121
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.640
but it wasn't something that people talked about in the open, you know,

122
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:38.560
it wasn't until I went in and sat down, like kind of one-on-one with them. Um,

123
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.540
otherwise the, the con the, the notion that ratings drive everything, it's just,

124
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.310
it's really built into the process. And it's, it's of course, you know,

125
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:51.070
that's just, that's just what you do. And, you know,

126
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:55.840
most of those people came up through the commercial TV system somehow,

127
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.270
and I obviously have a public radio background,

128
00:07:58.271 --> 00:08:02.500
and none of the editorial decisions I ever made before were based on how it

129
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:06.160
would rate or how big of an audience we thought we would have. I mean,

130
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:08.890
we always wanted a big audience. You know, you hope that, you know,

131
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:13.000
what you're doing is compelling enough to hold people's attention. Um,

132
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.720
but that's not what determines those decisions.

133
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.430
And so for me, see, you know, it was like, it,

134
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:24.370
it really raked against my nerves. Every time I heard them say something like,

135
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:24.611
you know,

136
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:27.730
that's not going to rate it when it's something that I knew would be a good

137
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:32.350
topic. Some of the decisions were made out of ideological reasons. Um,

138
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.940
but it also kind of drives the

139
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:41.020
division that, that we're seeing and the polarization in this, in the country.

140
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.780
So they might be pumping up, you know, um,

141
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.580
ideas that are exciting to some people, but then the world has never, you know,

142
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:50.590
they don't get excited about the, you know,

143
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:55.350
someone with a more nuanced or moderate take on things. And, um,

144
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.820
so that, that just kinda keeps driving everybody apart. And there's, you know,

145
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.490
you know, there's no sense that okay,

146
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:05.460
there is some benefit to compromise every now and then I just,

147
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.060
I know that that's not a popular idea right now because we've gotten so far away

148
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:12.240
from that. But, um, you know, the, the,

149
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.190
my sense is that it just,

150
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.820
when you stand back and look at the totality of, you know,

151
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.500
all the different ways that the financial incentives affect the content,

152
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.870
it's just driving us down the wrong path,

153
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.150
and it's only getting worse the way that I see it.

154
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.190
<v 0>You do a couple of examples in your resignation letter,</v>

155
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:37.190
which I recommend that everyone, uh, find and read,

156
00:09:37.191 --> 00:09:41.780
because I just thought it was so brave and incisive and

157
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.220
true. Uh, so thank you for it. And I'm a huge admirer of yours.

158
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:48.890
You did something out of principle that the vast,

159
00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:51.980
vast majority of people don't ever do. Uh,

160
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.890
and if enough people did what you did, we might actually have a chance.
