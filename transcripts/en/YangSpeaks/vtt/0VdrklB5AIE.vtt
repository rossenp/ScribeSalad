00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>There's been a lot of talk I've seen of a four day work week.</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.250
That seems to be something that, that, uh, you've been focusing a lot on lately.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.700
I'll tell you from my experience, when I was working a desk job and Israel,

4
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:15.150
I worked a normal office job five days a week,

5
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:20.040
the whole nine to five 96. And I was that whole time. I was like, dude, I could,

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.890
I could do this in four days easily. I mean.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.440
<v 1>You waste so.</v>

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.460
<v 0>Much time.</v>

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.040
And I always thought that that idea was brilliant because it's got to

10
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.500
do a wonders for morale, right? I mean,

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.620
have you been reading studies and literature about that?

12
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.690
<v 1>Yeah. The data is tremendous around a four day work week.</v>

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.610
And it's also common sense because work kind of expands to fit into

14
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:48.830
whatever time you have. You know what I mean?

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.780
Like it might give you a bunch of stuff to do with me and I,

16
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.230
you've got five days. It's going to take you five days. Right?

17
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.000
If I say you got this much to do you have four days, four days with.

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.100
<v 0>The promise of an extra, you know, week.</v>

19
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.460
<v 2>It's motivating, you know, in Israel,</v>

20
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.140
we only have one day we can. So, you know,

21
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.620
it's funny when I moved here, I was like, this is like a dream.

22
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:17.420
I love the long weekend, but, um, I started to feel like, God,

23
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:20.840
I wish I had one more day. And then I started to feel guilty about that.

24
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:24.260
And like, I really can't get enough. Can I like.

25
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.010
<v 1>Wait, wait, tell me more. So Israel, like, uh,</v>

26
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.090
this is a one day weekend, which I'm guessing is Saturday.

27
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.240
<v 2>Yeah. So, um, Sunday is the first day of the week. It's not Monday.</v>

28
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.560
So.

29
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.480
<v 1>That is wild. How that,</v>

30
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.440
like I consider myself a fairly worldly cosmopolitan

31
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.260
person. And I did not know that.

32
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.320
<v 2>Um, school is Sunday through Friday and you only have Saturday off.</v>

33
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.070
<v 0>They go to school six days a week. Can you imagine that? Hell? Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.580
<v 1>All right. I'm going to say something please. No, judge me. Um,</v>

35
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.210
I went to a prep school that had classes on Saturday. So I actually have,

36
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.430
you can imagine that whole week.

37
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.460
And so I can't imagine it and it was not pretty.

38
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.383
Yeah.

39
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.670
<v 2>I, I just read about it only recently because you've been talking about it and I</v>

40
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.650
find the whole idea so interesting.

41
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:23.420
And I think I want to read more about it and learn what it really means.

42
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.770
Cause we actually have an, a business and we have maybe 20 employees,

43
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:31.940
so we could decide to go that route for everyone.

44
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.790
But I would have to know like what exactly it would mean.

45
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.760
<v 1>Yeah. You should look into it for sure.</v>

46
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.620
And then maybe even run like a trial in your case, you would run a trial,

47
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:46.910
but the data is very positive where it says that productivity, uh,

48
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.010
either stays the same or goes up. And the sense,

49
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.560
like you get the same amount of work done. Uh,

50
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.610
and then there are reduced stress levels, increased morale.

51
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.730
Like the people use that extra day off, uh,

52
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:02.950
in a way that they find restorative and, uh,

53
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.790
productive and like, uh, you know, personal way. Um,

54
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.680
and so it's me, it's like upside on the personal side and the,

55
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:16.000
on the business side of the productivity side, uh, there's really no loss.

56
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.870
And in some cases they're there, there are positives, right? So, uh,

57
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.040
and to me,

58
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.700
society-wide to America in particular and you guys have like a very distinct,

59
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.030
uh, job, if I do say so, but,

60
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.660
but like America generally has this, uh,

61
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.380
this workaholism problem or some,

62
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.940
one person called a work ism, which is probably like maybe a better name,

63
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.410
um, where Kane's projected decades ago. He said,

64
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:47.590
we'll be down to a 15 hour work week because we'll be so rich. Uh,

65
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.650
and it turns out his estimates of the top line were right.

66
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:54.040
Like we are as rich as he said we were going to be. Um, but our work,

67
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.840
we are actually migrating longer,

68
00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:00.820
not shorter because of the nature of corporate culture and the economy

69
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:01.241
where it's like,

70
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.980
you have to be always on and available and the word is kind of creeps.

71
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.210
Uh, and that is what's happening right now.

72
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.590
And it's driving health problems, stress problems,

73
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.300
relationship problems, you know, like they're, uh,

74
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.280
a lot of signs already that the American work culture has kind of morphed into

75
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.770
something, uh, not terribly healthy.

76
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.780
And so I think a four day work week would be a massive improvement for many,

77
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:35.370
many corporate cultures. And I got to say like a lot of the times you're,

78
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:39.340
you're there. Like you're not doing. No. Like probably like one day a week.

79
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.050
You're just like, I didn't do today.

80
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.370
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I was, I probably was spending 30 hours a week on Reddit.</v>

81
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.800
I've I've,

82
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.300
I've gone to pages of Reddit that men have never even known.

83
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.740
I've been to thousands of pages back unknown pages of Reddit.

84
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.130
That was my job.

85
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.380
<v 1>Yeah. You're like someday I'm going to be a massive internet creator.</v>

86
00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:11.820
And I'm going to spend my time mining, like the deepest depths of the internet.

87
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.833
It preparation.

88
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.060
<v 0>Yeah. It was crap. You know, in Finland, in Finland,</v>

89
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:22.920
the prime minister had called for employers to allow employees to work not

90
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:25.410
only four days, but six hours a day.

91
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.140
So they are taking it to the next level.

92
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.360
<v 1>That's some next level stuff.</v>

93
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.380
I might not go to that extreme, but, uh, but I like where their heads are.

94
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.480
<v 0>Right. What else? Not work. Yeah. In Finland, they're saying no work,</v>

95
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.410
but you know, uh, I'll tell you what, because as business owners,

96
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:51.270
we're always thinking about like morale and you want to retain the good and you

97
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:54.090
want to retain the talent and make sure that they're happy and satisfied working

98
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:57.890
there. So I'll tell you what, on a four day work week,

99
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.830
I don't think anyone's going to leave your company. You know what I mean?

100
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.850
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, it sounds exciting.</v>

101
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.450
<v 1>Well, and retention would be very, very high. I'm sure your,</v>

102
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.120
your staff that are listening to this are like suddenly nodding being like, yes,

103
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.850
I don't know that I can do that for you Dan, because we have a production scale.

104
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.330
<v 0>What can I do? I can't give you the, you know what I'm saying? I mean,</v>

105
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.200
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.500
<v 1>I used to work in movies. This is, this is easy by comparison.</v>

107
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.550
If you don't work with like 14 hours, days regularly.

108
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.180
And this is as someone because I've also run startups.

109
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.250
And most of the startups I ran, uh, we worked our asses off,

110
00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:39.580
you know what I mean? So like, so there, there isn't like, uh,

111
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.580
there, there, isn't some kind of something against hard work. I mean, I,

112
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.000
I love working hard. Uh, you know,

113
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:51.610
that was one of the funny things about running for president on universal basic

114
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:55.510
income where people are like, well, what about work? And then like,

115
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.030
depending upon my mood, I would respond to different ways.

116
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.910
But sometimes I'd be glib and be like, I'm Asian. I love work.

117
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.280
But then, you know, back off a little bit. But, but that,

118
00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:09.940
that is one of the.

119
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.930
<v 0>The fallacies right about the UBI people say, Oh, you're just not going to work.</v>

120
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.680
But I feel like that's such a misunderstanding of the human condition. I mean,

121
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.030
nobody just wants to have no purpose in life. I mean, that's,

122
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.110
that's outrageous.

123
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.710
<v 1>Well, this is the thing that, that like, you know, like make,</v>

124
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.130
makes you laugh is like, they'll say two things. Simultaneously.

125
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.930
One work is the most important element of human life. And without it,

126
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.530
we are lost in two, no one will want to do it.

127
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:39.880
If you give them a little bit of money,

128
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.930
but those two things don't really come together. It's like, if it's so crucial,

129
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.340
then wouldn't we do it. And maybe slightly Bradley.

130
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.043
That's a great point.

131
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.520
<v 2>Also the beautiful thing about UBI is that it goes to everyone at</v>

132
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.550
any different position that they are in life.

133
00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:03.550
So you could be having a crisis.

134
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.450
You could be having a meltdown mental thing that doesn't allow you to work right

135
00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:08.231
now. You know,

136
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:10.990
you could be having a physical injury that you can't work right now,

137
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.711
even if you want to.

138
00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:16.510
So it reaches everyone at different places in their life.

139
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.090
You know, like it's, it's finding that.

140
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:22.030
You're just thinking about this one situation where you're healthy and you do

141
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:24.730
want to work, but like, you're not going to work because you have money.

142
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.110
<v 1>Because you're getting it. Yeah. What if you have an ailing loved one?</v>

143
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:32.860
What if you have a young child or something or mental health care for your

144
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.083
sorrow or more.

145
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.160
<v 0>Right now we have this incredible, the, well, we have a yeah.</v>

146
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.570
Or a year in a pandemic. We have this homeless problem, homelessness problem.

147
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.990
That's just kind of crushing LA right now.

148
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.380
And if you gave each homeless person a,

149
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.070
if there was that bottom S you know, social safety net,

150
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.120
I think you would see a lot, lot less,

151
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.960
almost probably to zero in terms of homelessness, you know?

152
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.610
<v 1>Yeah. If you had that level of resources, you could reduce homelessness very,</v>

153
00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:06.620
very dramatically. Uh,

154
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.730
the issue would be the transition because some of the people that are homeless

155
00:09:10.731 --> 00:09:14.360
right now are, have mental health problems or drug addiction problems. And then,

156
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.071
and,

157
00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:17.900
and don't may not even have a bank account where it's trying to send you the

158
00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:20.510
money, like what what's going on. But over time,

159
00:09:20.511 --> 00:09:24.680
if you knew that everyone had this money, that they were entitled to,

160
00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:26.270
then you would reduce homelessness pretty quickly,

161
00:09:26.271 --> 00:09:28.340
because then it would just look around and be like, wait a minute.

162
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.601
What's going on?

163
00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:34.370
This person has got like thousands of dollars a year in value. Like,

164
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.590
you know, as if we can, um,

165
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.680
make sure that it's actually working for them in a way. And,

166
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:44.900
and to the extent that people aren't in a position where it would work for them

167
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.160
because of their own volition,

168
00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:48.020
like it'd actually be pretty straightforward to like,

169
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:51.980
help it work for them where you'd have like an organization being like every

170
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.110
homeless person. I like bring it to the shelter.

171
00:09:54.111 --> 00:09:58.970
Like we're gonna get thousands of dollars. Like, let's go get that done.

172
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.680
I mean, it's, it is funny how, uh, market driven,

173
00:10:03.681 --> 00:10:06.860
everything is in the U S but if you give everyone intrinsic value and then all

174
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:11.030
of a sudden, like the market value starts kicking in for people. Well,

175
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.080
this is what I was running on before was that I knew that we'd been conditioned

176
00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:18.890
to think that we all needed to be economically productive. And then I said,

177
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:19.341
you know what?

178
00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:24.200
Technology is going to surpass our productivity in a lot of these arenas

179
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.030
pretty quick. And if we don't start evaluating ourselves in a different way,

180
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.840
then it's going to lead to disaster. And now we're seeing some version of it,

181
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.000
um, with the pandemic. Uh,

182
00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:39.200
and so I think universal basic income would very quickly disentangle, uh,

183
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.940
this confused the, the,

184
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.240
the mixing of economic value and human value.

185
00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:46.580
Because if you all just start getting money for breeding,

186
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:50.780
for living for existing, then you can start to feel like, okay,

187
00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:54.020
we all have some worth, that's independent of, uh,

188
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.410
how much money I'm making at any moment in time. Uh,

189
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.770
and then that alone would humanize your perspective really quickly.

190
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.731
<v 0>You know,</v>

191
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:05.330
the other kind of nice thing I like about the four-day week is something I

192
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.990
always thought about when I was working in my, my desk job.

193
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.663
It's like,

194
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.910
you pointed out this kind of a workaholic. I think it's kind of in Israel,

195
00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:21.470
it's the same, you know, and a lot of developed countries are around the world.

196
00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:24.260
I think people just have this, um,

197
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.720
overwhelming of pressure,

198
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.550
social pressure to show how much they care about their job by

199
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.210
working unreasonable hours. You know, it's like,

200
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.790
and in Europe I was always blown away by the fact that people get

201
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.100
like an entire month off, you know, and there just freaking everyone disappears.

202
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.980
I mean, that, that to me is, is unfathomable that, uh,

203
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.530
and then the thing that blew my mind is when you learn that like Chinese year,

204
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:54.880
even in China, these people are,

205
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.600
people are getting a month off and you don't see that are two months off,

206
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.630
even a month off in America.

207
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:05.260
We don't have that little less than a month. We don't have that.

208
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.980
<v 1>Did they travel back to their hometowns? In many cases,</v>

209
00:12:07.981 --> 00:12:10.260
I think it's less than a month, but it's significant. Yeah.

210
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.940
Though their work week, I think is like the Israeli model of six days.

211
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.020
<v 0>Really well. So they work hard. But the thing is in Israel too,</v>

212
00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:23.430
you don't have that. Well, you get holidays, but not like a designated time off.

213
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.280
And so to me, it's like, we, we,

214
00:12:26.281 --> 00:12:30.270
as human beings need to be defined by more than just our jobs.

215
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:31.590
<v 1>Now,</v>

216
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.830
I think a four day work week would be a massive value out of the United States.

217
00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:36.360
But I think that, you know,

218
00:12:36.361 --> 00:12:39.720
you wouldn't make it a one size fits all for every organization because I've

219
00:12:39.721 --> 00:12:44.280
been parts of some organizations where you probably want to have a, you know,

220
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.860
like, uh, a longer work schedule.

221
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.900
And there are certain types of roles and, um, the where it makes sense.

222
00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:55.500
But I think as a default setting where like the expectation is you have a four

223
00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:56.011
day work week,

224
00:12:56.011 --> 00:13:00.630
I think it would be an incredible improvement in large part because of what you

225
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:05.160
just said, Ethan, which is like, what is the purpose of life? Is it our job?

226
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.130
Or is it something bigger? Uh,

227
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.950
that integrates a job includes a job,

228
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.450
but it's not like exclusively a job. So,

229
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:21.420
uh, the four-day work week is something that to me would actually

230
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.590
make work like an appropriate part of our law.

231
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.870
Um, you know, uh,

232
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:32.220
in a way that right now we have to be honest that it's just creeping

233
00:13:32.221 --> 00:13:33.540
upwards. Like it's,

234
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:38.250
it's going like from five plus into like that

235
00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:42.720
zone. Uh, and I'm a data guy and there are very,

236
00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:47.520
very clear signs that right now it's having a damaging effect on

237
00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:52.260
our health, mental health, stress levels, relationships, family formation, um,

238
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.500
and all of that stuff was pre pandemic. Um,

239
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.250
the post in the pandemic, uh,

240
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.080
we just have to do anything we can to give people like a,

241
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.670
a real sense of wellbeing and even folks who

242
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.640
are doing well, quote unquote,

243
00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:15.630
like relatively speaking during this time are not exactly like

244
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.940
necessarily mentally doing well. You know, there's just a lot of,

245
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.800
uh, there's a lot of stress right now, um,

246
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:30.450
that I think if you had a couple of days a week or three days a week where you

247
00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:33.690
were genuinely disengaged from work,

248
00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:38.190
it would be enormously helpful for so many of us. Do.

249
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.960
<v 0>You see yourself doing that?</v>

250
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.390
<v 1>You know, it's funny, it's like,</v>

251
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:45.570
it certainly sounded like I was talking about myself. Does that, um, I mean,

252
00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:48.990
for me, I'm in a similar boat to you. I think where, you know,

253
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.490
we're in a situation where we're just trying to do things and help people.

254
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.650
Like I'm very busy right now. Uh, you know,

255
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:58.970
I just spoke at the DNC last night and then I went and talked about my speaking

256
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:03.710
at the DNC late later in the night. So,

257
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.030
uh, uh, you know, we were distributing economic relief.

258
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:11.090
Like you were working on this data project where we're trying to get people paid

259
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:12.720
for their data. Um,

260
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.830
I'm helping these down-ballot candidates who are running on universal basic

261
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:18.770
income. Cause we gotta try and make it happen for folks,

262
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.670
some campaigning for them all the time, uh, um,

263
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.720
campaigning for Joe in common against Trump. So I'm busier than ever.

264
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.400
And it's cool in the sense that like the world was on fire and,

265
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.360
uh, I feel like, uh, thanks to you and thanks to, you know,

266
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.090
some other folks who believed in me, like,

267
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:41.420
I feel like I've got something of a fire extinguisher fire,

268
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:43.520
and I got a fire extinguisher. Right. Um,

269
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.900
so like I better try and put the fire out because you know,

270
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:50.990
it's like not everyone has a fire extinguisher. Um, it's just like you guys,

271
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.110
where you looked up to, you were like, wow, there's a lot of freaking, uh,

272
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:57.590
need and suffering right now. And like, I can help. So you tried to help,

273
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:02.480
like I'm in the same boat you are where th th this is a time for me to like,

274
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.140
not worry too much about, you know, like, you know, my, my own, uh,

275
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.370
like balance.

276
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.810
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, it's,</v>

277
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.430
I think it's different for entrepreneurs are people who manage. I mean,

278
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.970
obviously it's important,

279
00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:22.240
but for people who don't have much of a choice in the matter, you know,

280
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.560
we're expected to do things.

281
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.760
<v 1>For listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
