00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.550
<v 0>Welcome to yang speaks the awesome Casa Murshid Hey, Costa.</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.370
M how are you?

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.990
<v 1>I'm good, Andrew, how are you? Good to see you.</v>

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.750
<v 0>It's good to see you too. So I feel like you and I had a bunch in common, where,</v>

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.210
uh, are you an immigrant or the son of immigrants? Uh.

6
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.320
<v 1>Immigrant I'm an immigrant. I was born.</v>

7
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.200
<v 0>You were four accounts man accounts. I mean, uh, you must remember, uh,</v>

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.700
arriving here. Um,

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.790
but the other thing we have in common is that we both have a legal background,

10
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.150
uh, though you became a civil rights lawyer, um,

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.430
and a community activist. Uh,

12
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:37.940
whereas I did something much more soul sucking for five months.

13
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.220
<v 1>Yeah, I did the corporate, I did the corporate law thing for a couple of years,</v>

14
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.150
uh, because you know, you need the paycheck to pay your student loans,

15
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.900
but you're right. It can be soul sucking if it's not the right fit for you.

16
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:54.230
And that's what helped me make the ultimate jump to civil rights and human

17
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:55.064
rights work. Full-time.

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.271
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:59.240
So tell us a little bit more about the civil rights legal work that you did over

20
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.500
that period of years,

21
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.940
because you'd built like a very strong following on the basis of fighting for

22
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:05.774
people.

23
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.130
<v 1>Yeah. You know,</v>

24
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.210
I think a lot of it goes back to what my parents ingrained and my siblings and I

25
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:13.370
had a very young age. So whatever you do in life,

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.760
if you're not centering service to humanity, it's really a waste of your life.

27
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.670
And that was the word that they used. And so, as I got older,

28
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:23.540
that was the lens with which how I looked at everything and going to law school

29
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.430
really opened my eyes to kind of understanding the incredible role the law

30
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.990
plays in whether people have basic access to decency and dignity or not.

31
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.880
And, uh, in law school, I got involved with a nonprofit here in Virginia, uh,

32
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.530
called the Virginia poverty law center,

33
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:41.330
their office of domestic and sexual violence.

34
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.410
And so started from a very early appointment, legal career,

35
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:47.630
supporting women who are survivors and that's pro bono work.

36
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.230
I do through this day. Um, I started working with, uh,

37
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:55.010
nonprofits on expanding healthcare and education and access and disaster relief

38
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.570
was a prison chaplain. And you know, all of this to say that, um,

39
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.470
when you get to understand how folks are struggling on the front lines,

40
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.720
you really begin to understand that, you know,

41
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.730
on the theme of you and I having a lot in common, Andrew,

42
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.180
you really begin to understand that these aren't Republican or Democrat issues,

43
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:12.950
these are basic human issues,

44
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.880
and it's critical that we stand together and work together and address these.

45
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.230
Um,

46
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.030
one of the most rewarding jobs I had was that a women's rights organization in

47
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:24.740
DC, where we were able to work with the department of justice and other various

48
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:26.240
government entities,

49
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.040
and just ensuring and advising that the policies being put before really do

50
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.790
give people equal access under the law. That's really what this has to be about.

51
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.620
<v 0>Yeah, you're a humanist and humanitarian first and foremost,</v>

52
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:43.760
I feel it's one reason I like you is that, um, you,

53
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:46.760
you have a very elevated perspective on a lot of these issues.

54
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.590
You're running in a relatively rural part of Virginia. Um,

55
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.250
that's been somewhat Republican leaning, but it's going purple right now.

56
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.750
And I think we've got a great chance to weigh in.

57
00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:59.800
I think you're going to have a lot of wind at your back. Uh,

58
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.060
can you tell us a little bit more about your opponent, um,

59
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.460
and your district and the race, the state of the race,

60
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.380
how is costume race shaping up?

61
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.170
<v 1>Well? So the reason is going great.</v>

62
00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:12.210
Let me start with my appointed career politician.

63
00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:15.210
He's been in office 34 years and, uh, you know,

64
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.850
pretty heavily corporate funded. Uh,

65
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.710
hasn't really made the most kosher decisions financially bought himself stock in

66
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.820
a pharmaceutical company, working on COVID-19 treatment way back in February,

67
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.030
and then told us the virus has low-risk and not spreading. And, you know,

68
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.110
his entire approach, his entire campaign has been to attack me for my faith,

69
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.310
tied up me to Islamic terrorism and just all sorts of ridiculous things.

70
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.030
That's never been my style and we're not going to respond in kind. Um,

71
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.640
this is a district, uh, you know, if you visit Virginia,

72
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.100
you get to really see Southern hospitality.

73
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.860
And this is a district where people really, uh,

74
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.980
enjoy being in each other's company. They enjoy, uh, you know,

75
00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:57.120
talking to complete strangers and there's this sense of civility. And,

76
00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.000
and I think honor and dignity, and the folks here that I've seen,

77
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.900
where even if you are from a different perspective or different faith or

78
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.020
informational background, you're treated with a lot of respect.

79
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:10.770
And I've really enjoyed that about living in Virginia and raising our children

80
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.510
here. Um, the race has been going extraordinarily well. Uh,

81
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.170
and the early voter turnout, um, shows us with, uh, a massive lead, uh,

82
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:22.560
about 136,000 votes have been cast so far.

83
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.330
And we're looking at the polling that we've done on people who've already voted

84
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.040
right now. We are getting over 70% of the vote. And so for us,

85
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:34.890
it's about, you know, continuing that, uh,

86
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.740
that trend pushing folks to the polls,

87
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.310
making sure we're winning the folks on the fence. And, uh,

88
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:44.400
we're having event after event where now, uh,

89
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.060
Republicans and Trump supporters are showing up and we're welcoming them in.

90
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.220
And it's been a really powerful experience so far.

91
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.530
<v 0>Um, I have the same experience on the travel costs.</v>

92
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.330
Some where I would show up places where there were frankly not like that many

93
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:00.540
Asian Americans, uh, um, in some of the early States,

94
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.560
but people will listen to you. Uh,

95
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.530
they realize if you're there for the right reasons, um,

96
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.830
people just want to be respected and heard. And if you respect and hear them,

97
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:13.350
then they'll respect and hear you. And then they'll figure out, it's like,

98
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:18.270
wait a minute. This person actually, uh, here's my experience. It's like, they,

99
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:21.420
they, they spent some time with you and they realized that there are only two

100
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:22.260
possibilities,

101
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:26.850
one that you're an absolute crazy person or two that you're

102
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:31.290
genuinely there to help. And then when they get rid of number one, they're like,

103
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:35.070
wait, this person is actually sincere. And that's, that's very,

104
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:37.500
very powerful stuff. Like, you know,

105
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.300
it can draw in people from both sides of the aisle because

106
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.220
Americans in my mind are unified and being fed up right now. Uh, you know,

107
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.140
and they're like different strains of, uh, fed up in this, but the,

108
00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:54.990
the fed up-ness is near universal. And if you seem like a genuine,

109
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.020
um, public and humanness to wants to help them in their families,

110
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.913
they'll support you.

111
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.780
<v 1>Well. And we saw that yesterday, we had an event, uh, here in the district,</v>

112
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.380
which about 30 people showed up not a massive event, but certainly not tiny.

113
00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:12.310
It was a good, good crowd. And we had a big Rashid for Congress sign behind me.

114
00:06:12.311 --> 00:06:15.790
It's the folks who are Trump supporters trying to drive in by Follichin,

115
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.080
you know, Trump 2020 with the Trump flags. And, and, you know, we ignored that.

116
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.250
And then whole bunch of them showed up carrying a Trump flag, uh,

117
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:25.660
and just kind of yelling and screaming.

118
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.940
And I paused the event and I had the microphone.

119
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.820
So I kind of raised my voice to the Trump supporters. And I was like, Hey guys,

120
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:36.760
you don't need to yell. You can be part of this conversation too.

121
00:06:36.761 --> 00:06:37.594
Why don't you come on in?

122
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.560
And I think I caught them off guard because I think they expected me to kind of

123
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:45.190
shout them out, come on in, let's have a conversation. Uh, I got their name.

124
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.390
One of the guy's name was Chad.

125
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.170
And we actually had a pretty meaningful conversation. Um, you know,

126
00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:52.600
I refused to respond to the vitriol,

127
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.680
but at the end of the day after the event ended Andrew out of these 30 people,

128
00:06:56.681 --> 00:07:00.430
five of them walk up to me one by one and said, I'm a left love Republican.

129
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.010
I have never voted Democrat in my entire life.

130
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.860
I feel like I don't really have a party. I wasn't sure where to vote.

131
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.000
But now after seeing the way you treat people, even if they disagree with you,

132
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.020
you've got my vote. And I'm like, that's brilliant because that's exactly.

133
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.680
<v 0>There are so many people who feel politically adrift right now,</v>

134
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.820
because if you're a lifelong Republican and you look up at Donald Trump and you

135
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:27.070
say, this is not what I signed up for. You know,

136
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:28.900
I voted for this guy last time and like,

137
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:33.370
this has been a crushing disappointment. And, uh, uh,

138
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.680
so then they're looking around and saying, what do I do? And, you know,

139
00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:39.880
you presented the right kind of unifying figure and message for them to say,

140
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.960
like, he's sincere, he wants to help. Uh, so costs,

141
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.620
you are forecast relief. Like after you get to Congress,

142
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:51.670
when's the first time you were exposed to universal basic income. Uh,

143
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.630
like when did you first hear that?

144
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.410
<v 1>You know, so I'm a student of history and, uh,</v>

145
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.390
there was a great book by Michael Hart, uh, called the 100 where he, uh,

146
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.240
ranks a hundred, most influential people in history. Um,

147
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.140
it's a great way to sound really smart by only reading like a five page X on

148
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:12.760
every major figure in history and, and a number of 52,

149
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.460
uh, was, uh, or is he ranks a person in, uh, Homer who was a second caliph,

150
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.150
uh, after prophet Muhammad and Omer was not just a religious figure,

151
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:23.590
but he was an economic genius.

152
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.540
And he introduced this concept UBI about 1400 years ago, uh,

153
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.830
to the, you know,

154
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.640
the Arabian peninsula and to the Islamic empire at that time.

155
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.550
And it was designed to be exactly that, you know,

156
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.170
a guaranteed form of cash payments to working families,

157
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.990
to ensure that they could have a basic level of,

158
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:46.990
of livelihood and it helped ignite the economy.

159
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.500
And that's actually why Michael Hart by Dr. Michael Hart ranks him as number 52

160
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:53.380
because of his economic genius. And that was one of them. So for me,

161
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:58.050
this principle is something that I was to be exposed at an early age and in my

162
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:59.010
research and study,

163
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.240
not only was I excited to find out that we were close to passing UBI in the

164
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.780
United States, back in the seventies, under a Republican president, no less.

165
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.810
But if you look at all the studies around the world, uh,

166
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.010
you find consistent study after study demonstrating that this not only uplifts

167
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:16.990
people out of poverty, but it ignites the economy. It,

168
00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:20.700
it advances entrepreneurship and innovation. It creates upward mobility.

169
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:25.350
It decreases rates of suicide and depression and mental illness and elevates

170
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:29.520
senses of well-being and just the overall human experience.

171
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.370
So I see every reason to push forward for this.

172
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.610
Haven't seen a single valid reason to oppose it.

173
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.311
<v 0>Yes.</v>

174
00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:41.210
And you're exactly the person who's going to help us pass this thing when we get

175
00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:44.510
you into Congress and we'll all be around and say, well, no, what,

176
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:49.280
what do we do to restore a path forward for millions of Americans,

177
00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:54.200
but also to reconstitute a sense of public trust and I've run organizations.

178
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.490
And it's very hard to just go around asking people to,

179
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.580
for their buy-in or their trust or their confidence,

180
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:05.990
unless you actually step forward yourself and invest in them. Like if we,

181
00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:09.550
as a society say, look, everyone has intrinsic value.

182
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.540
Your kids have value you matter. Uh,

183
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:14.600
and we're not just going to you and talk about it.

184
00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:16.850
Like we're actually going to put our money where our mouth is like,

185
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:21.170
that is actually the, the transformative, uh,

186
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.330
change that people will respond to because they're just people talking to

187
00:10:26.331 --> 00:10:27.710
them and not doing anything.

188
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:30.920
And then if you actually do something that meaningfully impacts and improves

189
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:35.030
their life, then it's a game changer and we can make it happen.

190
00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:38.420
Like you're going to be one of the people that helps make it happen from the

191
00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:42.980
halls of Congress starting 20, 21, after you win this thing after you win,

192
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.380
um, what district are you in, in Virginia?

193
00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:48.440
And if someone wants to help you and support your campaign, where do they go?

194
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:49.274
How do they help?

195
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.490
<v 1>We're the first district of Virginia. You can go to our website, uh,</v>

196
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.370
receipt for va.com. I'm on social media at cost and receipt.

197
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.440
That's my name really, really easy to find. And to add to your point, I mean,

198
00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:02.090
there's a reason Andrew, there are campaigns.

199
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.960
Logan has compassion through action that having compassion in and of itself,

200
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.090
isn't enough. You need to take action.

201
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.550
Otherwise it's just a meaningless word that makes you feel good,

202
00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:11.780
but doesn't actually do anything.

203
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:15.740
And so we need to elevate the level of love and compassion that we have for

204
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:18.050
humanity into meaningful action,

205
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:22.040
to get them the support that they need and deserve the basic human dignity,

206
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:25.850
food, water, and shelter, healthcare, education, and clothing. Um,

207
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.310
and for those who want to get involved in our kind of a campaign,

208
00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:30.470
I don't care what side of the political aisle you are on.

209
00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:33.620
If these values matter to you, check us out and receipt for ba.com,

210
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:38.450
send us an email to organizing@receiptforva.com. And we will get you on board.

211
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:44.120
<v 0>Yes, they will get you on board. Uh, I love it. Uh,</v>

212
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.540
and you're, you're beyond a humanist and human humanitarian.

213
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:52.430
You're like a grandeur. And I love to do our part because you're right. Um,

214
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.630
the only thing that makes me feel better about a problem is doing something out

215
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:59.590
it, uh, and we just need more Americans to have that same, uh,

216
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.610
approach because things suck right now. But if we all did something about it,

217
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.060
uh, we could improve things pretty quickly. And one thing you can do,

218
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:09.490
that's very straightforward is help candidates.

219
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:14.260
Like COSAM get into Congress where they can actually S uh, pushing, uh,

220
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.760
the laws of the land in the right direction. Thank you costs. Um, really, man,

221
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:22.510
I feel great about your race. I think there's going to be a very powerful, uh,

222
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.180
wind at your back. That's going to help blow you

223
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.270
forward across this metaphorical finish line. Um, and, uh,

224
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.150
you're just getting started. It's awesome. Thank you, man. Good to be here.

225
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.600
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
