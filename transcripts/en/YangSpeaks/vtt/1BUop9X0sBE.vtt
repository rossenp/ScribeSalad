WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>Have you been thinking a lot about education lately? Because I have.</v>

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.580
<v 1>Yeah. So, I mean,</v>

3
00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:09.170
you've produced educational content that has been seen by tens of millions. Uh,

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.890
you know, you,

5
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.390
you developed a real knack for conveying concepts in a way that people find fun

6
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:16.010
and engaging. Uh,

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.640
and right now there's so many families and parents who are struggling because

8
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.050
their kids all got yanked out of school.

9
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:23.690
And we're all wondering what the heck is next. Um,

10
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.150
so it would love to hear what you're thinking.

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.690
<v 0>I mean, can I ask you first, like, um, you know,</v>

12
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:34.520
I think that you probably have a pretty unique perspective on education also on

13
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.590
education policy that I probably don't have. Um, and,

14
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.920
and I have a lot of fear about what secondary education or like what

15
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.690
post-secondary education looks like right now.

16
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:48.830
What do colleges and universities and community colleges look like? Um,

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.560
you know, if we find that we cannot gather in the same way and like,

18
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:57.890
how do we interface with, with that, with the problems that creates,

19
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:02.180
because of course education is like so fundamental to the foundation of like

20
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.060
all, all of it. Like all of society, all of innovation, all of like progress.

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.620
<v 1>So post-secondary many colleges have no choice,</v>

22
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:17.150
but to try and reopen in September because their finances are

23
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:19.730
constructed, such that if they were to not have a semester,

24
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:23.030
they would go bankrupt and go out of existence. That's true for many,

25
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:25.130
many schools, including some high end schools,

26
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.110
they're only a handful of schools that have these big endowments. Uh,

27
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.590
and even the schools with big endowments actually are operated in a way such

28
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:38.450
that it would be ruinous for them to not have a fall semester.

29
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.700
Now, the big question is how can you charge what you're charging if all of it's

30
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:44.534
online.

31
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.040
And a lot of kids are struggling with this right now where some kids who have

32
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.480
the choice, which is not many of them,

33
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:53.210
but are trying to defer because they're like, hell,

34
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.200
if I'm going to have my first year of college, be this online.

35
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.450
And I'd spent $60,000 for the privilege of attending class in my jammies and

36
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:05.990
whatnot like that, they're not into that, uh, which is understandable.

37
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.920
But from the, from the school's perspective, they're like the show must go on.

38
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.890
Like the school must open, uh,

39
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.660
and like many things with the Corona virus,

40
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.160
there have been problems building up in the system for decades where our

41
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:25.760
colleges have been doing a lesser and lesser job of actually educating people or

42
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.700
preparing them for modern day life where the economist.

43
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.980
<v 0>Actually per dollar spent. Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.600
<v 1>Well, so here, here's the way the numbers work for the, for these colleges. Uh,</v>

45
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.910
if you look at the cost of various things,

46
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.950
most consumer goods have remained relatively stable in price, um, books,

47
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.640
electronics, clothes, like you don't see the prices going up to the moon.

48
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.500
So what are the exceptions to that?

49
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.280
The two big ones are healthcare and education where healthcare just keeps

50
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:54.290
getting racked up and up and up, uh,

51
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.760
like higher prices to the moon in colleges every year. Like, Hey, guess what?

52
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.340
We're, you know, 4% more expensive. And then you compound that.

53
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.470
And college now costs two and a half times what it costs even then when I went

54
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:12.340
to college or when you went to school where like both in our forties and we were

55
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.260
probably not that far apart. So, so yeah. Um, so then you, you,

56
00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:17.500
if you're a kid you're like, okay,

57
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:21.160
I guess college has 50 or $60,000 now in your family. Um,

58
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.950
and then does that mean that I get paid more on the way out? No,

59
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.730
it turns out opportunities completely stagnant. And I actually, if anything,

60
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.390
I've gotten rid of a lot of them. Um, so how the heck do I afford to go?

61
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.300
I take out massive government loans and the government's like, don't worry,

62
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.313
we've got you.

63
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.060
So now we're up to $1.6 trillion in school loans and families feel like, well,

64
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.710
I have no choice, but to take it out because it's college and, uh, you know, uh,

65
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.160
my kids got to go. The kid's like, well, clearly I'm going to college.

66
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.270
And so then they, they go, they get lit loaded up with this massive debt load.

67
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.510
And from the college's perspective, they've been paid.

68
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.150
They don't need to adjust particularly,

69
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.240
and they just keep ratcheting up the price every year. Um,

70
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.090
so if you dig deeper and you say, well, why is college so expensive?

71
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.560
Why is it that it has to go up in price? It's not professors,

72
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.940
it's not even facilities,

73
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:13.690
which most people would guess it's non-academic administrators.

74
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.640
The number of non-academic administrators in colleges have gone up 150% as

75
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.050
prices have gone up. They just keep on hiring more, uh,

76
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.910
administrators.

77
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.860
<v 0>Yeah. And like a lot of it's like, uh,</v>

78
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.160
like a lot of the money's being spent on sales basically like to like we're

79
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:32.040
spending money to make money. And that's just increasing. And like, if,

80
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.150
but if you don't, I was watching a friend of mine and go through this process,

81
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.970
her kids going to college. And like, she was like,

82
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.270
I got this huge booklet from this university in Alabama,

83
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.920
but the university of Montana, I live in Montana. So like the,

84
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.630
the local university, they only send us like a tiny little pamphlet.

85
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:51.780
And so I just don't feel like, and I'm like, no, don't go to the school.

86
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:53.190
That's spending all that money.

87
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.870
Like they sent you like a hundred dollars of material out of the blue

88
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.520
with, and like, you know,

89
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.740
chances are like 90% of those are not going to result in a sale or

90
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:05.490
more than that.

91
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.000
So like their customer acquisition cost is going to be astronomical.

92
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.430
And that's what you, as a student are paying for,

93
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.890
to acquire new customers for the university,

94
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.290
go to the school that isn't spending money.

95
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.280
Like it's spending money on teachers, not on, on sales, you know?

96
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.510
And so, so yeah, watching,

97
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.160
and you know,

98
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.540
people in academia have watched this happen and they've been, you know,

99
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:31.920
comfortable the whole time,

100
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.200
just watching as school has become closer and closer to not being worth

101
00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:38.010
it.

102
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.010
And eventually you get to the point where it actually isn't worth it anymore.

103
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:44.520
And for a lot of majors, I think you're already there where it, unless you are,

104
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.120
unless you have a ton of money, you're not, uh, th like,

105
00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:50.280
it's not going to be worth it for you to go to school.

106
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.160
It's not gonna be worth the loans. And like, it's, it's such a,

107
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.400
and it's, it's in the same way as healthcare.

108
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:00.830
It's like so depressing because this is like the one,

109
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.570
like one of the fields where it's like,

110
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.230
this is supposed to be all about helping people. And like,

111
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.280
it should be this like really great, good public,

112
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:12.260
good public service job,

113
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.950
but like more and more professors kind of can't feel that way because of how

114
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:16.940
much it costs.

115
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.720
<v 1>Like you don't have to become professors, man.</v>

116
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.500
Cause you have all of these PhDs who are in like the permanent postdoc,

117
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.790
adjunct hell,

118
00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:27.970
where they're going to get paid a subsistence and there's no future.

119
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.760
And it's like, Hey yeah, tough luck. Like, uh, you know,

120
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:34.030
we just keep minting P PhDs and there are no jobs for you.

121
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.690
<v 0>Yeah. And the, and, but, and that's,</v>

122
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:41.350
what's keeping the level of like how much professors are, uh,

123
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.720
cost of university. That's what key that's, what's keeping it level.

124
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.470
Lots of professors, lots of tenured professors are making a ton of money,

125
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.670
but on average, it's,

126
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.180
hasn't increased because you've got all these adjuncts and you've got all these

127
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:56.920
people who are never going to get tenure and just like getting paid very,

128
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.120
you know, the basic, basic livings or not, not even a full living.

129
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.140
<v 1>Teaching of students is not the primary expense that a lot of these places let's</v>

130
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:05.974
put it that way.

131
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.040
They're not all exactly pouring the millions into making sure that,

132
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.320
you know, your kid has some world-renowned expert teaching them, uh, that it's,

133
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.320
it's really immoral. Uh,

134
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:24.490
what's gone on and it's in the guise of, like you said,

135
00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:26.950
like a public good and a non-profit in some cases,

136
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.830
literally public institutions, uh,

137
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.370
we've really lost our way in so many,

138
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.660
in so many respects and education, healthcare,

139
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.940
I think are like the two that affect the most people that everyone can

140
00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:43.900
understand that the third one is housing as the other source of inflation,

141
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.580
but it's not as extreme as healthcare and education in Mo and in some places it

142
00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:50.870
is, but still a huge crisis. Yeah. It's,

143
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.290
it's not as extreme in like where you are in Montana.

144
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:56.860
Like there's certain Metro areas where it's it's as extreme or more extreme.

145
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.160
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And you know,</v>

146
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.770
what really frustrates me is I think that like, there's no doubt in my mind,

147
00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:09.490
and I've always said this as somebody who sort of teaches, uh,

148
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.430
through the internet, I've always said that like,

149
00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:14.410
there is no replacement for the classroom. And like,

150
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.540
that's not what we're trying to do with crash course.

151
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.340
We have no interest in that.

152
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.880
And I believe that that there's no replacement for the classroom,

153
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.820
except that like, now you have to know.

154
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.190
<v 1>Now you're replacing the classroom. There's like no choice.</v>

155
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:28.024
Cause that that kids.

156
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.300
<v 0>Lost replaced. And so like, you have to adjust that statement to say like,</v>

157
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.470
there's no system that is as good as the classroom, but there are other systems.

158
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.000
And if you're going to charge $60,000 a year for the classroom and other people

159
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:44.650
can find ways to charge $6,000 a year for an education without the

160
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:48.970
classroom, then you lose the classroom, which is the best way to teach people.

161
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.890
But you do lose it. Like you lost it anyway. And, uh,

162
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.840
because,

163
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.780
because we had to find a different way because it just costs too much money.

164
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.640
This is the crisis that many universities are struggling with right now.

166
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.900
And I think that they're going to be able to bear it for

167
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.790
one season. Um, no, a bunch of the marginal schools will close, even now.

168
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.240
It's like, just like, if you look around the country,

169
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.490
thousands of retailers are closing.

170
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.540
Thousands of theaters are closing tens or hundreds of thousands of restaurants

171
00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:28.220
are closing. I'm sure hundreds of schools are closing. Uh, not,

172
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.140
not the big wealthier ones are the, the major public ones.

173
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.280
Um, they can stand it for one season. Um,

174
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.250
but depending upon how long this drags on for,

175
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.240
you're going to see more insolvent schools pretty quickly,

176
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.050
because a lot of families are going to look up and say, wait a minute,

177
00:09:48.051 --> 00:09:52.610
like this makes absolutely no sense for us to be paying this kind of tuition.

178
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.800
<v 0>Do you have a advice for kids who are graduating right now? I say kids,</v>

179
00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:58.850
but they're, you know,

180
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.660
I mean like getting like this was their last semester of college.

181
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.170
So like welcome to the job market. It's COVID.

182
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.140
<v 1>Yeah. This is a very hard time to be looking for a job that is for sure.</v>

183
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.810
Um, and so a lot of it would be around trying to find any

184
00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:22.490
way in which you can contribute and develop that may or may not be in the field

185
00:10:22.491 --> 00:10:24.620
that you were thinking of. It might not pay what you want.

186
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.960
The living situation might not be what you want. Uh,

187
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:31.580
but just as long as you're growing at all professionally,

188
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.580
uh, you should feel good about it. Like, don't think, Oh,

189
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.820
I really want to get into politics. So I have to like,

190
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.970
make sure it's like the perfect job in that space. Like, no, no. Just,

191
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.360
if you can find anyone that, um, will give you a chance to lend a hand,

192
00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:48.380
just freaking go for it. And if that, and that's going to be hard to dislike,

193
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:51.870
given that it's easier said than done. Um, so it,

194
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:56.780
it would be about trying to find ways to make sure you are still developing

195
00:10:56.781 --> 00:11:01.130
in some respect, even if you're trapped at home for like a while,

196
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.070
uh, you know, making schedules for yourself,

197
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.070
like setting goals for yourself that are achievable, uh,

198
00:11:07.071 --> 00:11:09.050
reaching out to people when you don't feel like it,

199
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.120
because it's very easy to become somewhat of a shut-in I think during this time

200
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:15.890
for a lot of folks, uh,

201
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.880
but you have to continue to try and put yourself out there. Uh,

202
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.820
I don't have great advice. Uh, one of the things I will say though,

203
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:26.180
is that if you have time, like you're in better shape where like,

204
00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:29.570
if you're a young person, you'll be able to, uh,

205
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.840
have this be like an early bump in the road,

206
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:34.430
but it's not going to define your whole journey.

207
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.210
Like the people I'm the most concerned about are folks where, you know,

208
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:41.150
they spent 10 years working on some, uh,

209
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.990
restaurant or bar food truck that now is like completely caput. You know, like,

210
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.190
like that, that stuff breaks my heart because I'm like you having, like,

211
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:50.150
I love entrepreneurs.

212
00:11:50.151 --> 00:11:53.800
I love people who are actually trying to make something positive happen.

213
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.320
And this crisis is going to do a number on entrepreneurs to

214
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:03.040
a higher level than if you've got some corporate job that lets you work from

215
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:03.874
home.

216
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.020
<v 0>Absolutely. Yeah. And it's,</v>

217
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.790
it's so hard and so rewarding when it's working. Um,

218
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.400
but when it's not working, it is very hard to,

219
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.300
it's very hard to work through failure. Um, and like,

220
00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:20.490
not just while it's happening, but afterward.

221
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:23.400
And I think that the important thing to know is like one,

222
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.660
hopefully everybody gets that, like, this is no one's fault. Well, I mean,

223
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.540
um, that like your failure was not your fault in this circumstance. Um, but,

224
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.500
and also that like, um, you know,

225
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.970
like one of the things, one of the really great things about making your own,

226
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.140
your own project,

227
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.370
investing in like taking your money and spending it on your dream,

228
00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:52.260
instead of someone else's is how much you learn and you can take those

229
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:56.100
skills, other places and, you know, management, bookkeeping,

230
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.960
like entrepreneurs do everything. And so there, there is a lot, um,

231
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.321
like I think that they,

232
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:06.540
they are good hires and also there are other opportunities and other futures

233
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.070
and, uh,

234
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.900
there's going to be a lot of need for entrepreneurs and innovation as we find

235
00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:16.500
new ways to operate. Um,

236
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.770
whether that's about coronavirus specifically,

237
00:13:19.771 --> 00:13:22.200
or if it's just about the world continuing to change.

238
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.210
So we need people with those skillsets.

239
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.130
We need people with broad skill sets who are curious and passionate and want to

240
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.120
make.

241
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.450
<v 1>Better. Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation.</v>
