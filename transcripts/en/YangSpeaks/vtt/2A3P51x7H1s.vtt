1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>I'm going to tell a story. I don't know if you know, um,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.640
but when you ran for president in 2016, um,

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.440
you started like the pack to end all packs. Um, and I donated,

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.610
I was like, wow, great idea. This guy is onto something.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.270
<v 1>Know now the story of my story, I actually think of as a story of optimism,</v>

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.200
because, you know, in 2016 it was my view.

7
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:26.270
It's actually 2015 when we started this,

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.670
it was my view that unless we got the nation to focus on the

9
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:34.940
fundamental problem of the corruption of this democracy,

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.790
nothing else was possible. I mean, you know,

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.390
you got these candidates like Bernie and Hillary up on stage talking about all

12
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:42.890
the amazing things they're going to do.

13
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.670
<v 0>And onstage too, man. But we thought about that. What was up?</v>

14
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.830
They changed the rules on you, right?

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.090
<v 1>Yeah. So, so I wanted to get them to focus on these fundamental issues.</v>

16
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:53.840
And I said like,

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.820
I will run for president if I can raise a million dollars in 30 days. And, um,

18
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.960
and the way I'd run for president is by making this issue, the number one issue,

19
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:05.030
the issue I talked about before, anything else,

20
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:07.460
like we have to commit to fixing democracy first.

21
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.330
And so we raised the money in less than 30 days. And, uh.

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.100
<v 0>Then when you're like, Oh my gosh, now I have to do it right.</v>

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.480
<v 1>But the pollsters that we, you know, we had said, look, um, based on what we,</v>

24
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.930
we know you're going to qualify for the debates.

25
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.010
The first challenge was that the democratic party had a rule that said that you

26
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:29.750
had to be, uh,

27
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.980
you had to be listed on a certain list of polls and those polling companies were

28
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:35.870
not including my name. Um.

29
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.880
<v 0>No, I just wanted to stop you there. Lawrence,</v>

30
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:42.200
that was actually really tricky for us too. In 2018, they lived,

31
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.070
they had a bunch of poles and my name was not on them. And then you're like,

32
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:51.020
well, if I'm not on the poll, it's going to be very hard to qualify.

33
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.010
So leading up to the first debate, uh, Bloomberg.

34
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.180
<v 1>Wrote a,</v>

35
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.360
the Bloomberg press wrote a big editorial about how ridiculous this was,

36
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.600
because you could tell from other polling that I would have qualified,

37
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.110
but I wasn't on the approved list. My view at that point was okay.

38
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.350
Their rule was here's the approved list. You gotta be on that list. Fine.

39
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:12.720
The next time around, we'll make it a week before. Uh, yeah,

40
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.730
at the end of October, um, uh, my campaign manager called me and he said,

41
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:20.210
you know, we're going to qualify. You're going to be in the next debate. Um,

42
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
and I said, Oh, you know, he said, you got to get to work and preparing.

43
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:27.230
So I drilled down to begin to prepare. And then at the end of the week,

44
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.240
he called me back and he said, uh,

45
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.550
the Democrat party has just changed the rules for the debate.

46
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.830
You're not going to qualify. And they had,

47
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.720
they had recrafted the rule to like draw the boundary

48
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:43.190
precisely so that I would not qualify according to their new specified

49
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.430
rules. Um, and, uh, and so, you know.

50
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.370
<v 0>It was clear they were going to change. What was the new boundary?</v>

51
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:50.450
What was the old boundary? What was the new?

52
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.580
<v 1>So the rules they had originally announced, which they eventually agreed this,</v>

53
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.800
where there were rules with that. You had to be at 1% in three polls,

54
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.210
within six weeks of the debate, very reasonable. And then they, uh,

55
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.530
changed the rules to say, you had to be greater than 1% in three polls.

56
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.970
And then they gave a period carving out the time before the debate.

57
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.100
And that period was carved to lop off poles that had

58
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.270
qualified me. And then we knew what other polls were going to be announced.

59
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.700
And there weren't going to be enough polls that were announced to qualify.

60
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.160
<v 0>Me at that point. That was a coincidence.</v>

61
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.210
<v 1>They consulted the stars.</v>

62
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.350
<v 0>It was at 70% off that could form to somebody wrote me and said,</v>

63
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.330
uh.

64
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.600
<v 1>Yeah, pulse of the nation, right. Somebody wrote me and said,</v>

65
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.350
that's what Larry Mandarin born, because

66
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.680
that's fine. But anyway, the point was, it was clear.

67
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.980
They didn't want somebody up on stage causing trouble around this issue. And,

68
00:03:55.981 --> 00:04:00.750
you know, they saw what Donald Trump was doing on the, on the Republican Sage.

69
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.140
I don't blame them in some sense, but they didn't want this issue to be central.

70
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.230
When I tried to talk about this issue as being central, people are like, no,

71
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:09.060
I don't know. People care about health care. They care about,

72
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.670
they care about climate change. They care about student debt.

73
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.850
I was like the danger Larry is that, um.

74
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.260
<v 0>It, it, it seems no offense to you, but you seem like a very smart guy.</v>

75
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.953
<v 1>So.</v>

76
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.230
<v 0>The danger, when you talk about the end, you should know that, um, I,</v>

77
00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:31.260
I came away also convinced by our event together where I was like, he's right.

78
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.650
Uh, democracy reform needs to be front and center because we'll never actually

79
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.880
change anything meaningful without it. Um, but the, the, the hazard,

80
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:40.020
I think that people have,

81
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:42.810
when you talk about it is they think in terms of process,

82
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.060
that's what I meant by the smart guy. It's like a smart guy.

83
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:48.750
You have some fixes to the process. Uh, and the,

84
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:52.080
the danger is that people will just be like, Oh, you know,

85
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.340
like this stuff is going to be wonky and uninteresting,

86
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.100
but it seems like you've had a different experience when you talk about this,

87
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:03.900
because Americans realize that we right now are not functioning in

88
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.820
a democracy that is living up to the name.

89
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.320
<v 1>Yeah. And this is what's so hopeful. I think, you know, in 2016,</v>

90
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:13.080
I couldn't get them to talk about this year in 2020, you know,

91
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:17.430
our group and represent us in end citizens United succeeded in getting every

92
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:18.900
major democratic candidate.

93
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.220
You were one of the first to commit to fundamental democratic reform in the

94
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:27.660
first hundred days of their administration, including finally, uh, um,

95
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.770
Joe Biden. But I thought most dramatically was Bernie Sanders,

96
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:34.350
who finally came around to embracing vouchers,

97
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:37.200
which you had embraced back in April of 2019.

98
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.510
And he had an incredibly powerful story about why vouchers were so fundamental

99
00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:46.980
shifting power to ordinary voters so that they are the one driving fundraising

100
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:49.560
and the intention of candidates. Um, and so, you know,

101
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.030
my view is we've come a long way in five years. We came from the issue,

102
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.370
not even being recognized. No, it's not me. I mean,

103
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:00.680
there are a lot of people that helped you, a lot of people, right?

104
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.060
<v 0>Think about this issue though. Uh, you are the first name that comes to mind,</v>

105
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.630
right?

106
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.030
<v 1>So, so I think we're at this moment where, you know,</v>

107
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.210
the house of representatives passed HR one in 2019,

108
00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:13.900
the most important reform legislation passed by the house since the voting

109
00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:17.260
rights act of 1965. Um, if we get the Senate,

110
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.850
if we send the dark Lord Mitch McConnell back to Kentucky, um, and, uh,

111
00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:26.650
we get the presidency, there is a chance that a year from now, we will look at,

112
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.940
uh, what happened and say, Holy, we have passed fundamental reform,

113
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.510
including public funding, aggressional campaigns.

114
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:37.930
And I hope I'm including something more like what you were talking about

115
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:42.540
vouchers to help drive that funding and that democracy dollars. Yeah, yeah.

116
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.120
Which is what you were very clear right upfront. And then it was so funny,

117
00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:48.880
Kirsten Gillibrand, his campaign I was talking to, and they're like,

118
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.110
Andrew Yang says a hundred dollars, hell, we're going to say $600,

119
00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:57.000
$600 for voter of, if you have three, three campaigns,

120
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.780
a president Senate and house in, in one cycle. So you sparked it. Yes,

121
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.243
that's right.

122
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.480
So I think we have a real shot if we can just get beyond the

123
00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:11.380
disaster that is looming in November of 2010.

124
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.450
<v 0>This is very optimistic and HR one has many tremendous</v>

125
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:19.000
reforms in it. Um,

126
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.520
what are like the top reforms that you're excited about?

127
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:25.480
And to the extent HR one's missing anything, is it missing something? Yeah.

128
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.240
<v 1>The most important thing in HR, one is public funding.</v>

129
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.760
It's missing a more robust voucher components because the kind of

130
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:36.820
public funding it's framed around is matching funds,

131
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:40.900
which is what New York city does. And matching funds are great, very helpful.

132
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:44.650
But the point is you're still appealing to a relatively small slug of pig.

133
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.851
I mean, you know, most,

134
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:49.630
most rich people don't realize that the average American can't just write a

135
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:51.520
check for a hundred dollars to a politician.

136
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.680
That's just not within their capacity,

137
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.290
but if they had a hundred dollars democracy dollar,

138
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:58.630
the way you were talking about it, of course,

139
00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:00.930
what else are you going to do with it? They're going to give it to politicians.

140
00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:04.690
So the point is, that's a more fundamental reform we've got to build in.

141
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:07.930
And I know the sponsors of HR one are eager to think about how to expand it.

142
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.920
So H O one,

143
00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:12.550
that's the most important thing that gerrymandering reform is incredibly

144
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:13.121
important.

145
00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:17.230
The restoration of the voting rights act is astonishing that we're still

146
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:20.410
fighting about this issue, but yes, that's incredibly important.

147
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.430
What it's missing is, is much stronger support for rank choice.

148
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.110
Voting would have been,

149
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.840
would have been extremely important in this democratic primary, um, uh, um,

150
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.230
you know, as well as having an Iowa caucus that actually worked,

151
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:38.140
that would have been helpful too. But, um, you know,

152
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:41.560
I think that that's something a lot of people are talking about now we could,

153
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.330
we could begin to get towards. Um,

154
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.540
but I think those are the central and most important things at that bill.

155
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.440
<v 0>Well, it's, it would be a great leap forward to have, um,</v>

156
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.200
matching funds for these congressional campaigns,

157
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:57.390
because some of the candidates we're seeing are generating popular enthusiasm,

158
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.140
and that if you got a bunch of small dollar donors, uh, it could add up quickly.

159
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.460
But I agree with you.

160
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.020
People don't realize what a big deal it is for someone to donate 10, 20,

161
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.100
50 bucks to a political campaign. Uh,

162
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.550
one people don't have any disposable income lying around in that way.

163
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:18.000
Like if you think 50, a hundred dollars to them, that's like a really big deal.

164
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.580
But the second thing is people are so burnt by politics that it,

165
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.390
it takes like a really big, uh,

166
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.070
connection or attachment to motivate someone to donate to a candidate.

167
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.850
It's one reason why I'm so appreciative of the yang gang, um,

168
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.590
rallying behind my campaign because I was really bad at dialing for dollars. Uh,

169
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.170
Larry, I was terrible at it. So I was like, Oh man,

170
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:42.330
I hope some everyday America.

171
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.190
<v 1>The worst, you know, when I was doing it.</v>

172
00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:48.260
And I did it very little when we came to, you know,

173
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.820
close to getting to the million dollars,

174
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:51.560
my campaign manager sat me down and he said,

175
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:54.230
you've got to call these people and make sure it happens. Okay. So I did it,

176
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.830
but the thing I was thinking as I was doing it as, okay, I hate this.

177
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.120
Every normal person would hate this. What kind of person likes this?

178
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.140
Because you know,

179
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.980
that's the kind of person we're attracting to run for Congress. And you're like,

180
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.330
do we really want our nation represented by the sort of person who likes sucking

181
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:12.800
up to rich people from money?

182
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:16.100
Because that's not how you build leadership in an issue.

183
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.930
<v 0>I joke about it all the time that you'd have to be out of your mind to go to a</v>

184
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:25.040
cubicle farm and dial for dollars and think that was the way it ought to be.

185
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.520
The problem is that as soon as you're in that cubicle farm, then you're like,

186
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:31.880
well, I had to swim through to get here. Yeah.

187
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.540
And so now this system's going to protect me because I'm an incumbent.

188
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:38.630
I start out with, let's say a million dollar advantage over, uh,

189
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.320
Tom Dick or Harry or Sally or whoever was going to run against me. Uh,

190
00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:46.220
so here it is like this moat now benefits me.

191
00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:47.600
So I guess, uh,

192
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.550
I will suck it up and take advantage of the fact that I can do a soul crushing

193
00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:54.320
activity better than the next person.

194
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.490
<v 1>The most depressing story I heard was a member of Congress told me, he said,</v>

195
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:02.840
you know, one of the things about Congress is it's totally broken institution.

196
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.800
Nothing happens.

197
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.330
And it turns out fundraising is the one thing where you feel like you've

198
00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:11.210
accomplished something. So it's like doing pushups. So he says like,

199
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.770
I can go down for an hour and I can have my target and I can meet my target.

200
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.310
I can feel like, Holy, I did something. I accomplished something today.

201
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.640
And you're like, Oh my God, this system is now built.

202
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:26.060
So that the only thing you feel proud of is your ability to raise money because

203
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:29.210
you can't do anything else. You can't legislate. You can't work with anybody.

204
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:31.250
You can't bring about government services.

205
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:34.820
Anybody's respectful of it's just fundraising. That is the measure of success.

206
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.500
<v 0>That is very dark and very human and so important.</v>

207
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.110
Uh, there was a person running for president.

208
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.100
Hopefully he doesn't mind that I say this. Uh, but Senator Michael Bennet,

209
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.200
and one of my colleagues was with them on the plane and was like, Hey,

210
00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:54.130
so, uh, what's motivating the run. And he said, honestly,

211
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:57.790
it's so I can try and get something done because I'm not getting done in the

212
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:01.300
Senate because we don't pass anything. Yeah. Uh,

213
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:05.110
and so it speaks to the same thing where if you have a good person who wants to

214
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:08.050
accomplish something, unfortunately dialing for dollars,

215
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:10.780
at least gives them that momentary reinforcement,

216
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.660
that that day they got something good, done, or good quotes. They succeeded.

217
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.250
That's such a microcosm of something. I think.

218
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:26.020
So one of the things I said on the trail was that in

219
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:29.230
American life today, if you have money on one side and people on the other,

220
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.230
the money is going to win, who's going to win.

221
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:35.290
And people all like uniformly in my events. They were like, yeah,

222
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:38.920
the money is going to win. And so this is the case I made for democracy dollar.

223
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:41.740
I said, we have to unify the people in the money and then you have a chance.

224
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.800
Then the legislators are responding to you again.

225
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.110
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
