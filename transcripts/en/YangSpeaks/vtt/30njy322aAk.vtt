WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.830
<v 0>You've endorsed Joe Biden. Um,</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.000
you and I have connected on a number of political topics that we're both

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.460
passionate about. And I remember you saw,

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.670
I saw a tweet from you championing local journalism,

5
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:13.350
which I could not agree more with, uh,

6
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:17.160
universal healthcare and universal basic income you think should be on the

7
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:21.510
table. Now, given the nature of the crisis, we're in the midst of, uh,

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.730
did you have like a, an arc politically, you,

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.440
was it something that you and your family were interested in from a while ago?

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:32.760
Or, or did you just, uh, start paying more attention more recently?

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.770
<v 1>Uh, no, I've always been engaged. Uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.250
one of the things I admire about the NBA players is they're a lot more active

13
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:44.420
than I was at that age. I was pretty self-centered at that point,

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.050
worried about my own career. So I think I've been more active,

15
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:50.990
but I was always engaged. I grew up in a, in a, you know,

16
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:55.700
my parents are conservative. Um, for me, the arc was,

17
00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:00.470
as I was, I was always socially pretty liberal. You know,

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.800
I just didn't understand why anybody cared.

19
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:08.600
If you were sleeping with somebody of the same sex or what the color of your

20
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.180
skin was or any of those things. Um,

21
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.760
but I think I've certainly had an arc in terms

22
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:20.990
of economic issues. Um, you know,

23
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:25.490
I think at one point I was a, um, you know,

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.520
balanced the budget guy, um,

25
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.260
and still am to a degree. My,

26
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.720
the difference between me and and conservatives would probably be,

27
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:40.610
I I'd raise taxes and bring in more money so we could help more people. Um,

28
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.140
but recently,

29
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.030
right before you started running for president,

30
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:50.090
so these two things really propelled me,

31
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.650
my wife and I had watched it's probably a three or four year old

32
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:59.240
documentary that Robert Rice did. Um, when he was teaching at Cal,

33
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:01.520
he still is. And, you know,

34
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:05.270
he was talking about trickle down, doesn't work,

35
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.290
you know, going up, building the middle class.

36
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.810
So people have more money to spend.

37
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.830
That's what builds an economy and helps everyone.

38
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.220
And so we watched that made all kinds of sense.

39
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.490
Trickled down has never made any sense to me whatsoever.

40
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:25.760
Like this idea that they're going to create jobs up here.

41
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:30.530
Like I know I've never even run a business, but if I run a restaurant,

42
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:34.550
the only reason I'm going to hire more waiters or waitresses is I have more

43
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:35.384
customers.

44
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.530
Like you can give me a tax break and put another a hundred thousand in my

45
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:41.600
pocket. I'm not going out to hire anybody.

46
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.730
<v 0>I'm not going to all of us.</v>

47
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.830
<v 1>Somebody, if I have the need to hire him. So Robert Reisch made sense to me.</v>

48
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.810
If now I have more customers in my restaurant, I do better.

49
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.700
I hire more people, they do better. And so I watched that,

50
00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:03.490
that a lot of sense. I learned a lot from that. And then, I mean,

51
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.720
within months,

52
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.700
if not even weeks after watching that you're on stage talking

53
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.580
about universal basic income,

54
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.910
which that idea goes exactly with that,

55
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.280
putting more money in people's pockets.

56
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.470
And so I will say that's a more recent thing to me. Um,

57
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.090
within the last year of saying, wow, this makes a lot of sense.

58
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.430
It's, it's not only more humane Farrow to people in our

59
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:37.720
society, but to me that helps everybody,

60
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.910
including the people at the top.

61
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.640
<v 0>Yep. Yeah. If you're running a business, you know what you need,</v>

62
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.070
you need customers with money to show up. Uh, you know,

63
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:50.220
and if you're in an environment right now where everyone was being sent home,

64
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.950
uh, like it's like, who are you going to profit from? You know, you,

65
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:56.670
you look outside, we can't all be Amazon, you know,

66
00:03:56.671 --> 00:04:00.090
I guess Amazon is still doing all right. Uh, so, uh,

67
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.930
so this is the trickle up economy. And I, I saw the same documentary you saw by,

68
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.420
um, with, uh, Robert Reich. And, um,

69
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.260
he's been a very powerful and consistent voice in this direction.

70
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.610
Keeps on writing books keeps on pounding the table, making the case. Um, uh,

71
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.940
and the economy has just gotten more and more extreme over time. Uh,

72
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:21.270
it was the most extreme winner take all economy in the history of the world,

73
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:24.240
pre pandemic. And then the pandemic just, uh,

74
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.260
turned everything up to 11. Like it just sped everything up.

75
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.920
<v 1>Well, and here in central Florida,</v>

76
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.300
we have felt that about as much as anybody because, you know,

77
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:39.150
we don't have a lot of business here. I mean,

78
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:42.180
it's a tourism business and we're in the service, you know,

79
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.560
it's a service economy.

80
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:48.120
So we got a lot of people working low wage jobs here.

81
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:52.890
We have the biggest affordable housing crisis in the United States.

82
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.610
Um, because we're playing, we're paying people 10, 12,

83
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.460
$15 an hour and that's it. And there's,

84
00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:06.270
there's no upward mobility when you're running a ride at Disney

85
00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:11.220
world, you know? And so we can make our unemployment numbers look okay,

86
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:13.320
but those are not high paying jobs.

87
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.570
And then when people quit traveling and quit going to those

88
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:23.310
things in a pandemic, I mean, it is really, really been bad.

89
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.890
Um, I know the local, the biggest local food shelter, uh,

90
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.190
in the area has, you know,

91
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.200
been doing about triple the number of meals that they normally do. Uh,

92
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.300
it's been really, really rough and it hasn't been, you know,

93
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:45.720
you would, you would think, I mean, for everybody, this pandemic has been rough,

94
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.940
but you would think when you go through a crisis that it should be shared,

95
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.130
it should be a shared grief in a shared adversity.

96
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.920
And that's not way it's been, you know, Bernie Sanders treats tweets out,

97
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.150
you know, one of your former opponents, like at least every other day,

98
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:08.930
tweets out how much some of these billionaires have made during the pandemic.

99
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.250
And, you know,

100
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.510
their net worth is going up and we've got all these people who can't eat.

101
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.020
And that led to your tweet today, which is my favorite.

102
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:22.280
And we'll probably be going up on a sign in my room when I can get the

103
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:26.540
calligraphy done about, you know, and I'm not reading the quote right now,

104
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.860
but imagine having the wherewithal to,

105
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.510
you know, solve people's problems and then you don't do it.

106
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.640
I, you know, it's, I can't solve the problems that Jeff Bezos can solve,

107
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.570
but I've been lucky enough I can solve a few people's problems

108
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.760
and you have to do it. I, I love that tweet I've sent it. Uh,

109
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.920
I retweeted it, but a people not on Twitter,

110
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:56.190
I was sending it out to everybody today. Um, and,

111
00:06:56.191 --> 00:06:59.390
and I think that's where it should be.

112
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.400
We should really be a community, a community of people who are helping others.

113
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.430
Um, but we can't help. We can't count on charity.

114
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:10.640
That's why to me UBI and things like that,

115
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:12.800
like we can't depend on charity.

116
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:17.180
We need systems in place that will help people through this. So.

117
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.170
<v 0>Well, you know,</v>

118
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.390
one of the reasons why I think that there's something universal about sports and

119
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.010
there's something universal about coaching,

120
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:26.380
where you form a community with your team, you know,

121
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:28.930
you're part of a group you're on this together. Uh,

122
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.440
and then you naturally want the same kind of thing for our country when you're

123
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:33.400
going through a hard time.

124
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:36.820
It's not like the team's going through a hard time and you just start ignoring

125
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:40.720
people or singling people out, or just like, pretend some people don't exist.

126
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:44.440
It's like, okay, who's, uh, who's on the team. Like, you know,

127
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:45.950
let's come together. Uh,

128
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:50.380
and here in America we have to all get on the same team. Really.

129
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.600
Like there's just too many problems that are facing folks

130
00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:59.240
for us to just continue all of the, the strange, uh,

131
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.800
strange trend of just everyone blaming the other side for everything,

132
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.080
uh, for turning on each other and singling each other out. Uh, it's,

133
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.850
it's painful for me to stand.

134
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.980
Like it's painful for me to see our country go through this time and

135
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.910
have all these self-inflicted wounds, really. You know, it's like,

136
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.400
like this would be a very rough time, even if we did everything right.

137
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.200
And I would say that for most of us looking at it from the outside,

138
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.080
the NBA was an incredibly high functioning organization and did just about

139
00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:35.440
everything I could do. Right, right. Um, at the bubble.

140
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.920
And then it's in the sharp contrast to most of our other institutions where

141
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:41.710
everyone's looking around being like, who is supposed to be running the show,

142
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.640
who's supposed to be leading this, uh, the federal government, um,

143
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.920
like has not been leading. Uh, you know, and, and I think you're a coach.

144
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:54.070
You're like a leader of men. You're a community builder. Uh,

145
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.430
I think it's one of the, why people love sports,

146
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:59.850
love the NBA is that there's something very human about that. Uh,

147
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.660
and it feels like that's what the country needs right now.

148
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.100
<v 1>Yeah. To me. And I'm sure to you too,</v>

149
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.920
cause I've heard you speak a lot. Um,

150
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.410
the most frustrating thing is we have the wealth

151
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:16.250
in this country.

152
00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:21.080
We have the resources to do this and to take care of all of

153
00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:25.220
our people. Now there's countries in the world that are very,

154
00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:29.930
very poor and don't have the wherewithal to take care

155
00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:34.490
of the problems in their country. We have the wealth to do that,

156
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.350
and we just don't have the systems in place and

157
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.600
we don't have the will or to make the sacrifice to

158
00:09:44.601 --> 00:09:49.460
make this a more equal society where everybody can

159
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:50.390
share in this.

160
00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:55.280
And that's what frustrates me if it was a shared experience and we

161
00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:58.490
just don't have the money to help people. We do,

162
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.560
we have the money to do it.

163
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.280
<v 0>Well, everyone knows it now, too. Stan, when I was running for president,</v>

164
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:08.240
people would be like, Oh, like, how do we pay for that? And then we just watch,

165
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:14.090
uh, our Congress write a $2.2 trillion check mainly to the biggest

166
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.950
companies. And then you're just like, Oh,

167
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.780
we could have done this the whole time.

168
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.790
<v 1>You know, you can do it. I mean, you can do universal basic income.</v>

169
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.560
You can do Medicare for all or some form of universal

170
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.570
healthcare. You know, whatever's best. I'm not a, I've said to people like, ah,

171
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.430
I'm not, I'm not as smart as you or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

172
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:40.460
And I haven't gotten as deep into that. Um,

173
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.530
but those possibilities are out there and why we would choose as a wealthy

174
00:10:45.531 --> 00:10:47.840
country to have the levels of poverty.

175
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:52.670
We have to have the number of people without healthcare and without health

176
00:10:52.671 --> 00:10:56.690
insurance that we have is just mind boggling to me.

177
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.940
And it's a failure in our moral character in our

178
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:06.170
country. And, and there's no other way to put that. I mean, you just,

179
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.180
you can't sugar coat that you have the resources to take care of these problems.

180
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:14.930
You refuse to do it. Your moral character is lacking.

181
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.790
I'm not like that's not a partisan thing. That's, that's just the truth.

182
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.520
<v 0>Yeah. And, uh, it should be a political to stand. It should just be human.</v>

183
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.680
Uh, and, um, unfortunately right now, our politics has become, uh,

184
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.410
inseparable from, uh, from the media narratives, uh,

185
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.330
from frankly the corporate interests,

186
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.960
because so many of our politicians just have very,

187
00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:45.440
very rich corporate interests whispering in their ear all the time. Um,

188
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.700
I'd love to, to change it. I think we have a chance to change it. Uh,

189
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.350
in some measure after Trump is out and Joe and Camila are in,

190
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.720
I believe some very big things will be on the table.

191
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.120
And really then the challenge is going to be,

192
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.250
can we get enough done in let's call it four years, uh,

193
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.140
that people feel like we have genuinely started to come together

194
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:11.260
and rebuild that trust, not based upon statements,

195
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:15.400
but upon actually improving people's day-to-day lives and reality like that,

196
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.730
that to me is going to be the challenge over the next number of years,

197
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:22.510
because if we fail in that, then people's mistrust.

198
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.620
And that, that disintegration of, uh,

199
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.980
the sense of community is just going to accelerate as well.

200
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.910
I feel like we have a window of opportunity here that we have to take full

201
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:37.870
advantage of. Um, I may play a role in that. Um, but that's,

202
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.760
that's where my head is going now.

203
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.370
<v 1>As you know, I mean, I think people are realistic.</v>

204
00:12:44.371 --> 00:12:48.600
We're not going to solve all the problems within a,

205
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.160
within a four year term, but I think we can start to solve them.

206
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:58.080
And I think we can show people in very concrete terms. Like you say,

207
00:12:58.081 --> 00:13:00.510
not in statements, but in things getting done,

208
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.400
we can show people the possibilities of what a better society

209
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.520
could look like for everybody in this country.

210
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.770
And we could set a direction of starting to get there. Um,

211
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.460
that to me is what can happen. And that takes concrete things.

212
00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:18.690
It's not just statements,

213
00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:23.100
but we start to turn around and we get more money in people's

214
00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:24.600
pocket. Um,

215
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.460
heading toward hopefully at least some form of universal,

216
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:30.480
basic income.

217
00:13:30.481 --> 00:13:34.530
And at least we start working toward getting more people,

218
00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:38.850
health insurance, and you know, all of these problems. Are we going to get,

219
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:43.620
it turned to 180 degrees in, in four years?

220
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.880
No, that's not realistic, but can you turn it 60 degrees,

221
00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:52.680
70 degrees and give people the feeling we're on the

222
00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:57.480
right track. We can do these things. We have the resources,

223
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.690
we have the leadership, we can do these things.

224
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.470
That's what I'm hoping will happen over the next four years. I'm not,

225
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.480
I'm not expecting Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, people like you.

226
00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:12.300
I hope in the mid administration. That's a great hope for us.

227
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.210
I'm not expecting like, Hey,

228
00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:19.590
they took over January of 21 and it's February now yet. We've got it all.

229
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.130
I got my universal basic income check and we're ready to go.

230
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.400
<v 0>Yeah. Even if we do everything right, you're right.</v>

231
00:14:26.401 --> 00:14:29.820
That a lot of it's going to be, have we made headway? Have we made progress?

232
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.010
And it's a little bit like if you take over a team,

233
00:14:32.011 --> 00:14:33.300
you're not going to turn around and being like,

234
00:14:33.301 --> 00:14:36.990
we're going to be champions like that. Like, like this year it's like, look,

235
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.740
give me a few years and hopefully we'll have a direction. We'll have a culture.

236
00:14:40.741 --> 00:14:44.730
We'll have a sense of trust, a sense of confidence. Um,

237
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.960
that that's certainly, uh, my vision for the next number of years. Uh, well,

238
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:50.100
Stan, uh,

239
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:54.680
such a pleasure with you in a privilege I've been in admire of you and your work

240
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:58.820
for a long time. Um, you're a force for good, a force for community,

241
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.370
a force for progress in our country.

242
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.490
And I'm looking forward to finding ways that we can work together.

243
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:07.580
One of my dreams is that, uh, is that universal,

244
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:09.710
basic income takes root and communities around the country.

245
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:11.870
And I think that people like you are going to be a big part of it.

246
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.530
<v 1>I would love to help you in any way. I mean, I think that, you know,</v>

247
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.540
my big, biggest issue has just been justice inequality in every area,

248
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.710
racial justice, G you know, um, women's rights,

249
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.430
uh, you know, LGBTQ rights,

250
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.810
but economic justice is one that just cuts across

251
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.060
all of those and for everybody and makes a true difference in people's

252
00:15:40.061 --> 00:15:44.560
lives. And so if you ever need my help, even in a small way,

253
00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:45.640
I would be,

254
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:50.710
I would be happy to get on board because I think you've shown us a blueprint.

255
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.300
Now we just have to have the, uh, political will and courage to, uh,

256
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.290
to give it a shot.

257
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.220
<v 0>Well, thank you, Stan. Thank you for listening in.</v>
