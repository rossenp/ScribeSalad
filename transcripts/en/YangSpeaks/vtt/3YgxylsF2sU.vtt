1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.410
<v 0>Let's talk a little bit about, uh,</v>

2
00:00:01.411 --> 00:00:04.620
what are the negative effects of party controlled primaries? Uh,

3
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.150
so we've touched on it a little bit and I've seen it. Um, so, uh,

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.660
number one is you're going to have any comment from one of the two parties. Um,

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.540
and so if you have a safe seat then, and I've,

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.140
I've been supporting candidates down balance, I've seen some of this, um,

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.970
so you can have the person get primary from within their party. Um,

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.230
and, and then if they get to the general, then it's a foregone conclusion. Like,

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.850
you know, you don't even need to pay attention to the general,

10
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.310
really in a lot of these districts and like 80% of the districts.

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.080
So you wind up with only one real challenge to the

12
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:41.640
incumbent and that is within their party primary because you

13
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:46.590
have a party controlled primary system. Um, so by the general election, it's,

14
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:49.230
it's already determined who's going to win. Um,

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
there's a quote by William Tweed, uh, that said, um,

16
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.000
uh, that, yeah, that, that, that said I don't care. Who does the electing,

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.890
as long as I get to do the nominating. And so, um, so,

18
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.630
uh, so the,

19
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.040
so the problem with the party controlled primary system is that,

20
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.230
uh, it restricts voter choice. Uh, is that a fair way to characterize it?

21
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.890
<v 1>I absolutely want more voter choice, but let's fast forward.</v>

22
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.360
I want more freedom for legislators to do what needs doing. Yeah.

23
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.370
You want a good result. Yeah. Again,

24
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:29.480
the real problem is not what they're saying in the primary or who even makes it

25
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:33.200
through the primary. It's what they do once they're there. We, if we had,

26
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.410
if we got rid of party controlled primaries,

27
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.140
some of the talented,

28
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.710
passionate elected officials will still win,

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.870
but they will now have the freedom to do what needs doing. Okay. So,

30
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.810
so that's one of the problems that with the party primaries, but here's the,

31
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.050
another thing that I think you might you in particular might find really

32
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:56.840
interesting. I don't know if you would call this part in my book,

33
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.420
cause it's short, I'm working a longer, a longer article.

34
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:01.850
It's called the dual currencies of politics.

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.740
<v 0>Oh yeah. I found this fascinating when you talk about votes and money, um,</v>

36
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.450
and that money is actually a better currency because if you get extra,

37
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.830
you get to keep it, uh, and more of it's always better. Um, whereas voting,

38
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:17.090
if you get extra votes,

39
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.730
then you don't get to roll them over to the next election.

40
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.240
<v 1>There's a lot of nuance to this. So, uh, again, remember,</v>

41
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:25.460
we're looking at now politics as an industry.

42
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:27.830
And so we're trying to find out what's going on in this industry.

43
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.850
And here's a lot of times I'm talking about how it's similar to the for-profit

44
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.360
industry, but now I want to talk about how it's different politics is.

45
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:40.160
The only industry I've come across that really has two currencies.

46
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.390
So think of it this way.

47
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.370
Some customers in politics pay with votes voters,

48
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.230
some customers, a much smaller number pay with money,

49
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.300
donors and special interests who are also donors and in large

50
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.163
part.

51
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.450
So we think a lot of times we have a money in politics problem.

52
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.540
And I want to say here we don't,

53
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.550
what we have is a relative value problem.

54
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:13.270
Like we have an exchange rate problem, like, you know,

55
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:16.850
the dollar being worth way more than, you know, whatever the,

56
00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:20.830
the Euro is worth or something point being in politics right now,

57
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:25.630
the currency of money is worth unbelievably much more than the

58
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.480
currency of votes. And I'll give you a couple examples. So as you said,

59
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.493
first of all,

60
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.420
there's a limited utility because you only need one vote more than the

61
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.190
other person to win the other and you can't carry them over.

62
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.020
Whereas money has no upside limit on its utility, but it couple other things,

63
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.750
the only time votes really have any value is in

64
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.030
the party primary, but only in half of the primaries,

65
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.361
right?

66
00:03:55.361 --> 00:04:00.250
Because if the district is gerrymandered or even naturally occurring

67
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.750
a red district,

68
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.970
the only votes that have any value are the voters that turn out to vote in the

69
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.720
red, Republican primary. So it's actually, if,

70
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.630
if voter turnout in the primary is 20%, but you know,

71
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:15.580
10% of the people are turning out here,

72
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.390
their votes have power and have value.

73
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.120
And then when you get to the general election,

74
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.740
each vote is sort of worth zero because it's already

75
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.590
decided determined. Yeah. And you don't,

76
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.600
you also don't care if you turn off lots of people with

77
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:37.690
the currency of votes. Because again, even if,

78
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.490
even if you made everybody so angry that only 10 people came out for the

79
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:44.380
election and there were 10 votes,

80
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.650
as long as you got six and the other person got four,

81
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.720
it's no problem for you.

82
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.770
Whereas you want to keep turning out more and more people sort of to be involved

83
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.550
in money,

84
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.020
but you're fine if you depress all the people who are so disgusted with,

85
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.490
with, you know, uh, politics that they stay home. So one of the cha,

86
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.120
so whenever we're looking at the innovations, I'm talking about,

87
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.040
I'm looking at the behavior, it's going to incense,

88
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.210
but I'm also always looking back at how does it change the relative value of

89
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:14.140
votes to money.

90
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.440
And I'm going to tell you a secret about this money and politics problem.

91
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.820
You know, why there's so much money.

92
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.660
It's just because it's a really good investment.

93
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.180
The ROI is really good.

94
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.440
<v 0>There, there are a lion lobbying I saw, I saw on a study.</v>

95
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:30.300
It was something like 17 to one.

96
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.310
I mean like w get where the heck can you get a 1700% return on?

97
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.590
Does it mean anything you do in business? I mean, that's like,

98
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.290
like if you're a rational business person, you're investing.

99
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.200
<v 1>Rational, rational behavior. So here's the thing.</v>

100
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.060
What if we were able to artificially decrease by a

101
00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:52.590
factor of 10, the amount of money in politics,

102
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.190
you know, so all the lobbyists are spending, you know, one, uh,

103
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.590
10% of what used to spend,

104
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.570
but we leave all the existing rules and incentives for how people get

105
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:06.170
elected and the elections machine, real legislative machinery and intact,

106
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.670
you know what we're going to do.

107
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.620
We're going to essentially make it 10 times cheaper for the

108
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:16.190
self-interested money to get the same result.

109
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.020
So here's the key make votes,

110
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.960
more powerful than money,

111
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.650
make that currency, the one that matters,

112
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.080
and then it won't make all money go out. But the point is,

113
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:36.980
if the votes are more powerful, you can't buy with money. What votes don't want.

114
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.240
<v 0>Yes, that's the dream.</v>

115
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.650
<v 1>For therefore, then the money that goes in, you know, will,</v>

116
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.270
will lessen if it's not at all connected with what's good for the country,

117
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:51.790
because you won't be able to get the ROI on it.

118
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.010
<v 0>Yeah. People are making decisions. My play, I can't get what I want.</v>

119
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.890
<v 1>And, and rational. And so I am always telling people,</v>

120
00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:10.810
stop going after the money and politics and go and making it less powerful

121
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:15.760
and go after making voters more powerful and go after making general

122
00:07:15.761 --> 00:07:20.560
election voters more powerful and having an open primary where everybody's on

123
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:24.610
the same ballot, and then we'd have five people advance to the general election.

124
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.910
And then you ranked choice voting in the general, which, you know,

125
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:29.170
we can come back to the package.

126
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.730
That means that the election is never decided in the primary.

127
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.960
It's always decided in the general and all of a sudden,

128
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:41.590
every voter matters because using rank choice voting,

129
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.710
even if the district is deeply red or deeply blue,

130
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.490
that's so much less of a problem with this system.

131
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.680
We sort of leapfrog over the need for gerrymandering

132
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:57.160
reform. Certainly not fair gerrymandering and everything,

133
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.230
but it's not the gating factor.

134
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.880
Let's do final five voting open top five primaries

135
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.260
plus rank choice voting in the general elections and in the general elections

136
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.370
alone. And you're going to choose, you're going to rank these five candidates.

137
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.870
And then we'll elect someone with the majority of, you know,

138
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:20.140
the broadest appeal to the most number of voters, but the main reason.

139
00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:23.650
And that's what a lot of people that like our CV talk about is how it's more

140
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:26.380
fair and democratic. And it is those things that I'm for those things,

141
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.480
but for the purpose of caring about results that make a difference in real

142
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:35.350
people's lives, the main and like the,

143
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.610
the biggest hugest benefit of rank choice voting is that it's,

144
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.890
it eliminates the barrier,

145
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.880
the biggest barrier in the politics industry to the new competition,

146
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.310
which is the spoiler argument.

147
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.480
<v 0>Oh yeah, don't vote for that person. You know, you're going to waste your vote,</v>

148
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.920
et cetera. Like you get rid of it.

149
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.270
So rank choice gets rid of the spoiler effect. It gets,

150
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.570
it diminishes the incentives to campaign negatively because of your trash,

151
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:04.650
someone, then you both look bad and then the person that third place ends up,

152
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.980
uh, uh, coming up, um,

153
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.050
it makes it so that the ultimate winner has at least some kind of level of

154
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.460
support among, uh, more than 50% of the folks, which right now,

155
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:19.140
if you end up with, you know, split votes,

156
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.260
like you could have some person that no one really will not, no one,

157
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:26.140
but than 50% of people like, um, ends up winning Clara.

158
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.050
The winner like happened where the governor in Maine,

159
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.650
or to some extent with Donald Trump during the primary process,

160
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:35.400
because there were, there were places that you won with less than 50%, um,

161
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.100
during the nominating process. Uh, so this.

162
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.730
<v 1>Political parties, a lot of times the presidential primary, you know,</v>

163
00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:47.870
favors these plurality winners and you don't get sort of the person who's

164
00:09:47.871 --> 00:09:50.840
everybody's second choice, but nobody's first choice.

165
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.790
<v 0>Yeah. So this was an appealing vision to me, the top five, uh,</v>

166
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.620
and plus rank choice voting in part,

167
00:09:57.621 --> 00:10:01.160
because I was trying to imagine if you were an independent minded person who was

168
00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:05.240
considering running for office, and you got some people behind you, uh,

169
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.970
and let's say there's an incumbent, uh, let's call, you know,

170
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.510
it could be either Democrat or Republican. It doesn't matter for this example,

171
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.780
but you think to yourself, okay. If I get enough people behind me,

172
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.200
all I have to do to make it to the general is being the top five. Uh,

173
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.470
and that seems kind of achievable. Like guys,

174
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:25.700
do they go out and get enough votes to be in the top five? And then if he goes,

175
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.110
if I do get on the top five,

176
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.540
then we all contend in a ranked choice voting format.

177
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.760
And then if I get a lot of people behind me,

178
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.980
not even as their first race necessarily,

179
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:38.930
but like I become everyone's second choice because, um, you know, I I'm, uh,

180
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.560
common sense and suggesting things that people like and, you know, like, uh,

181
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.970
it seems like I'm going to try to deliver a along with what most of us want.

182
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.640
Uh, so that that's like a very appealing vision. Uh, and so I I'm,

183
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.830
I've always been a fan of rank choice voting,

184
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:59.360
and I think you and Michael helped open my mind to the fact that the

185
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:04.370
primary system is a huge component of who can successfully run for

186
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:08.120
office and then what their incentives are after they get there to your point.

187
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.570
<v 1>And now we know that the primary systems,</v>

188
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.670
a huge reason why votes have so much less power than money.

189
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.720
<v 0>Yeah. That too. Uh, because like you said,</v>

190
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.110
it's very constrained because if you're not registered in that party,

191
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.510
and one of like the folks who shows up to that primary,

192
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.700
then you just showing up to the ballot being like, well,

193
00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:26.570
I don't even really have,

194
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.050
and this is one thing you really do have to reflect on for a moment is that for

195
00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:31.520
the average person in that district,

196
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.750
they don't really have a meaningful choice because if they weren't able to

197
00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:39.440
participate in the, the nominating party's primary,

198
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.780
then they're just showing up to the ballot box and being like, okay,

199
00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:43.190
I can vote for one of these two people,

200
00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:47.180
but one of them is almost guaranteed to win. Uh, and it's one reason why people,

201
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.680
uh, right off politics, cause they're like, my vote doesn't matter. Like,

202
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.180
like this is a waste of my time. Uh, you know,

203
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.950
when people have that perspective, um, I look at them and I think like,

204
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.870
this person may be rational. You know? It's like,

205
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.510
there's some people being like, no, you're a jerk for thinking that it's like,

206
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.690
well, maybe they're onto something. You know, it's like,

207
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.690
if you had a system where it was truly irrational, uh,

208
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.540
then you could hold people to a higher standard because you'd be like,

209
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:15.970
your vote really does matter because you can actually make a difference,

210
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.710
you know? And, um.

211
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.350
<v 1>Oh, I tell people, Hey, look,</v>

212
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.740
if you only have time to vote once just vote on primary day.

213
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.090
Like if you somehow can't do twice, just vote on primary day. And, and,

214
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.420
and I also, you know, people are often saying we need to have universal voting.

215
00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:34.170
We need to have mandatory voting. We need to increase turnout. And I say,

216
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.050
why are we artificially trying to increase turnout? You know,

217
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:41.040
the best way to increase turnout, make turning out matter.

218
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.390
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
