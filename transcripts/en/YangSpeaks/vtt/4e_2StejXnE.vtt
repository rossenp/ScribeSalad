00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>I don't even know why. I think everyone was just kind of like, Oh, you're funny.</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:04.230
Or, you know, you just kinda.

3
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.660
<v 1>Where are you funny? Like when you were in high school,</v>

4
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.150
anyone think of Ken as the funny kid.

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.680
<v 0>Oh, um, quite frankly, none of my critics think I've ever been funny. So I,</v>

6
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.920
you know, I, I don't think I'm waiting for that to happen really. You know.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.090
<v 1>John's still, hopefully, hopefully, you know.</v>

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.940
<v 0>I'm being funny 50 years of charm as they say, but now I,</v>

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.070
I really thought that, uh, I was just, uh,

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.460
there's a great line from, um, uh,

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.780
waiting for government is a Christopher guest moving and where Eugene Levy was a

12
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:42.740
dentist. He played a dentist who was, uh, like a poop,

13
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.380
had a dream of being a stage performer. He goes,

14
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:49.370
I wasn't the class clown as a kid, but I studied him. And so that was,

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.960
I felt like that was me as a kid. Like, yeah, like I loved comedy,

16
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.160
but I was a stressed out kid just trying to,

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.180
trying to get into a good school. That really was me. In a nutshell,

18
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:06.860
I was just trying to do my best in every, every class I had.

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.300
And I was really too stressed out to be a class clown.

20
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.760
I wasn't relaxed though.

21
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.990
Cause part of comedy is being relaxed and I don't think I was relaxed as a kid.

22
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.810
<v 1>So then you got to, do you take this acting class?</v>

23
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.560
Did you do any improv comedy or anything like that through your college career?

24
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.320
<v 0>No, I kind of, we, we,</v>

25
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.730
part of theater is doing improv acting exercises at night, just, um,

26
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.100
so I would improvise in certain acting games that we would have

27
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.660
and, and I just had a natural proclivity towards comedy.

28
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.760
And even then, I mean,

29
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:50.300
and then I started doing musical theater and uh,

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.320
they have a really great musical theater company, hopin horn at, at Duke.

31
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:59.150
And so I would do that. I would do Huff and horn and um, and then dude,

32
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.470
and then I was, uh, I actually applied to drama school and I got accepted.

33
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.710
Yeah. And, um, but they were,

34
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.740
that's where I had my crisis of uh,

35
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:14.120
of a crossroads because there was a fork in the road because I was either going

36
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:17.690
to go pre-med and, and continue on it.

37
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.080
Cause I was taking organic chemistry my sophomore year. And then I,

38
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.590
or I could go into drama class where you have to take, you,

39
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:29.390
you have a drama lab at your whole life is basically, um,

40
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.030
it is all drama. I mean all your courses,

41
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:36.620
all your electives everything's geared. So, um, and I remember the head of,

42
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.390
um, do drama saying, we think you could do both. And then, and I was like,

43
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.200
no, I there's no way I can do both. I'm not smart enough.

44
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:49.760
I don't have the bandwidth. I'm not that, you know, correct incorrect.

45
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.970
I even, even at 18, 19 years old,

46
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:56.450
I was painfully aware of my limitations and I knew that I did not have the

47
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.400
natural aptitude, um,

48
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.290
to fully maximize potential in both areas.

49
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:07.270
So it was really hard, man. I made a very difficult choice, uh,

50
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.210
after discussing with my parents. And of course they were like, you know,

51
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.550
you know, go with something when your parents didn't come down.

52
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.680
<v 2>Hard for theater, they're like sign you.</v>

53
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.650
<v 0>Instead of waiting. Instead of waiting for Godot,</v>

54
00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:24.180
you should wait on your pre-med. No.
