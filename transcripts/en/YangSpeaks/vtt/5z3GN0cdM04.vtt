1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.480
<v 0>I appreciated the fact that, uh, you know, recently on social media,</v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.790
you started engaging politically. You were like, look,

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.590
this stuff's kind of important.

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.150
Like I know some of you might not love everything,

5
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:15.540
but let's like actually talk things out and like, uh, you know,

6
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:19.080
be reasonable human beings, which, you know, I completely agree with.

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.430
<v 1>Yes. But it's difficult to get like,</v>

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.270
even people who agree with you and you're just like, here's this point.

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.680
And even people with agreed, like, yeah, cause those cry lives blew it.

10
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:33.830
It's like, no, no, no, listen, man, like this one point is good.

11
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.730
And then tomorrow Trump's going to have a middle piece, middle East peace deal.

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.850
That's the kind of, got to say is, okay, you can't just say it's bad.

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.400
You know what I mean? And it's so like,

14
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.840
and even if someone agrees with me with like just rhetoric or negative,

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.020
they don't get the hell out of here. Let's all talk, go yell at everybody else.

16
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.350
You go yell at Trump's Twitter feed. If you're here,

17
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.540
we're all going to engage in some talking. And uh,

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.390
I took a little break because it was really hard to have a conversation. And,

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.530
and I, I have no hard feelings. Like I have a heart of stone.

20
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.200
I don't give a about anything. When I went to says about like, if it's a good,

21
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.120
if you zing me or make fun of me in a good way,

22
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.820
like go lose some more matches or something like you get me, I get it.

23
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:15.020
It's funny. Uh, but I want it to be good entertaining, and I want it to be,

24
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.230
I want both of them, there should be more than two sides,

25
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.700
but that's a whole other conversation,

26
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:24.080
but I want it to be human beings engaging and not just

27
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.360
be so mad that they want to go out in the streets or wish death on somebody

28
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:30.860
talking about politics.

29
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.950
<v 0>Um, I don't disagree that we need a different level of dynamism in our political</v>

30
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:41.520
system. Uh, that right now the duopoly is not great for.

31
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.413
<v 1>[Inaudible]. I hate it.</v>

32
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.710
<v 0>Well, even as the numbers guy, uh,</v>

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.610
I think the last numbers I saw 30% of Americans,

34
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.440
I self-identified as Democrats,

35
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:58.940
maybe 25% Republicans and then 40%

36
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:02.510
independence. And so you look up and say, well, that's quite a,

37
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.440
quite a great deal of people that self identify as independence. Uh,

38
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.440
and then when it comes to this sort of election, everyone's like, well,

39
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.800
you got these two choices and you're like, like, is it like,

40
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.120
how did this happen? Uh, again, um,

41
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.690
so to me, the path forward, um,

42
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.560
is to have rank choice voting so that they're just different points of view

43
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.610
reflected. And you don't have anyone bullying, anyone saying like,

44
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:32.600
can't waste your vote. Can't waste your vote. Now, like in this circumstance,

45
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.750
I'm like, you know, everyone knows I'm for Joan Camilla,

46
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:38.120
and I think Trump needs to go. Um,

47
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.890
but I also think that the fact that we have, um,

48
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.990
we have so many Americans who are just like, ah, like, you know, I,

49
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.840
I feel like my vote doesn't matter because by the time it gets to me,

50
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.500
I'm like choosing between, uh, people that I would not have chosen, um,

51
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.990
is not good for democracy. It's not good for the country.

52
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.490
<v 1>And it's like that Simpsons episode where it's like, uh,</v>

53
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.430
the two monster space monsters come and land. And he goes,

54
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.310
we got to pick from one of us, one of us, the Republican ones Democrat.

55
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.790
And he goes, I'm going to vote third party. And he goes, go ahead,

56
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.370
throw your vote away. And it's like, and then the next,

57
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.820
they're all enslaved in camps. And it's like, it's the Monster's rule the world.

58
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.450
And it's,

59
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.860
it's so heartbreaking because I know that there's a lot of

60
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:24.940
similarities on both sides to where that is, that, that middle ground,

61
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.220
that 40% of people who want something else,

62
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.320
but tend to agree with 95% of everything on the sides and all day

63
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:36.670
long, we and find these straw men have like this fridge, right.

64
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.810
Or fringe left that we can go see, they're all just like that. And you know,

65
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.850
and it's, it's,

66
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.240
it's disheartening because I I've been around a little bit and I've seen things

67
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:46.510
happen.

68
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.080
And I kind of know that it's a show and a game and you're getting things done

69
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:51.250
and you're going back and forth.

70
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.980
But young kids today who are online all the time,

71
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.540
think that Twitter is real and this is how it goes.

72
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.480
And this is life. And one, it's not accurate.

73
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.470
That's like 5% of the world is on Twitter and everyone else is doing real life

74
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.970
things. And if you just go,

75
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:10.420
I'm so mad at Ben Shapiro right now and you go outside and you're like,

76
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.300
he has nothing to do with you gardening in your backyard.

77
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.750
<v 0>But like folks who have to interact with groups of Americans in real</v>

78
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:23.550
life, in different parts of the country, uh, in bars, clubs,

79
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:26.280
wrestling, arenas, autograph sessions, it's like,

80
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:31.170
you have a very different sense of this country and of human beings

81
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.470
then, uh, just like turning on TV and being like, Oh,

82
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:38.220
these people that people cause like you've actually met thousands and thousands

83
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:42.930
of people, uh, in, uh, you know, in, in their everyday lives.

84
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.870
And then the characters don't really stand up. I mean,

85
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:48.140
certainly I had that experience running cause like I met,

86
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.680
I've met thousands and thousands of people.

87
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.730
<v 1>Like you. Yeah. You, I mean, I'm somewhat,</v>

88
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:58.170
I've been around some people in bands that, but you just like two years ago,

89
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:02.940
like how does that you all of a sudden, no 5 million people and you go,

90
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.803
Oh right.

91
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.280
People are for the most part decent and want the same thing and whatever

92
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:10.380
conversation and how cool is it to be,

93
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.420
don't want to shake your hand back when you were on to shake hands.

94
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 0>Well, uh, you know, I'm happy to say Nick,</v>

95
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:21.240
that I kind of assumed that most people were, uh,

96
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.140
pretty reasonable and we just wanted the best things for themselves and their

97
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:27.030
family. So it wasn't like when I went on to the country,

98
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:31.530
I discovered it was more like I confirmed what I already knew

99
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.450
because I grew up in a town and like,

100
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:36.150
I remember the kids I grew up with and like, you know, like,

101
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.340
did we do some dumb that, you know,

102
00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:41.670
like if you were to paint it now and like social media, like, you know, like,

103
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.990
uh, like, would it look terrible? Sure. Like, are those people, are,

104
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.850
are those people, um, somehow terrible human beings? Of course not like,

105
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:54.840
you know, we're just like, we're like, um, teenage idiots,

106
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:58.070
like it was a different, and we were lucky to.

107
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 1>Have that non social media world and non camera world.</v>

108
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.370
And you have to do stupid stuff as a kid.

109
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:09.230
And then the point is you grow and then everybody wins.

110
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.531
I,

111
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:14.270
and sometimes I feel that people don't want you to grow.

112
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.830
They want to make an example of something, uh, and go, Oh,

113
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.340
you didn't tell him for this properly, this thing he did 20 years ago.

114
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:27.080
And you go, ah, that sucks. Um, but I did, I'm talking to you right now.

115
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.740
Doesn't this count as me growing like, Nope.

116
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.553
Okay.

117
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.400
<v 0>I, again, people are so much more reasonable in person and online it's like,</v>

118
00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:38.650
like if you were to stick two people in a room, it's like,

119
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:42.790
they would not say 90% of like the nasty things that they'll like put in a

120
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:46.690
social media post. This is not the way people are the,

121
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.220
that they interact. Um, so I get the sense, um,

122
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.310
from this conversation that if you were to describe yourself politically,

123
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:58.540
it would be something of an independent where you, you see things, uh,

124
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.240
um, in a non-partisan way. Is that accurate?

125
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.460
<v 1>Uh, yeah, very much. So I go out of my way to do that. Um, I lead a little bit,</v>

126
00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:10.780
right. Uh, I like lower taxes. I lean a little bit. Right. Um,

127
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.270
I, I, I've done some stuff with, uh,

128
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.780
Fox and Fox business and even the people on the left who have been on panels

129
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.420
with me, like, they're fantastic. They're so smart. I love it. Uh, but I,

130
00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:26.050
I lead a little bit. Right. And, uh, I, uh, but every issue,

131
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.290
I don't just go down the line and go, this is it. And put the yard sign out.

132
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.970
Like I want to examine every issue. And I feel like what you mentioned earlier,

133
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:38.830
there's that 40% of people who have this don't really totally relate to a

134
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:39.341
party,

135
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:44.080
but we want this general idea and they're not really spoken to as much.

136
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.610
And I feel like there's that huge middle and I don't want to,

137
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.100
I'm an independent, cause I hate every, the two candidates. That's not the case.

138
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.650
I just, I lean. Right. And uh,

139
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.570
I want more people to meet in the middle and I am very pro third-party let

140
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:02.290
alone frigging 20 parties to just give people some different options, you know?

141
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.270
<v 0>Yeah. I think the path to a third party really is a different voting system,</v>

142
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:10.840
like rank choice voting because you know, like it's,

143
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.230
instead of case where the mechanics actually make a world of difference,

144
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:18.010
like if you give people the ability to vote their preference, uh,

145
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.740
and there's no, there's no pressure to, you know, again,

146
00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:25.410
like avoid quote unquote wasting your vote and the rest of it. Um, uh, the,

147
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:29.740
the reality is that both party registrations are actually declining over time.

148
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.450
You know, neither Republicans nor Democrats are, uh, in growth positions, uh,

149
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.890
in that way. And so to me, like if you're,

150
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.020
uh, if you're pro democracy,

151
00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:47.350
but also even if you're a pro these parties trying to become more responsive to

152
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:52.240
people and maybe even resuming, um, like a growth position, um,

153
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.000
then they need to try and engage with different types of,

154
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.510
and have different types of ideas in that.

155
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.030
That was one of the reasons why I ran, um,

156
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.110
is that I thought the democratic party could use some new ideas, uh,

157
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.370
including universal basic income, which strikes me as not terribly, um,

158
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.470
left or right. Like it's just.

159
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.650
<v 1>UBI. I was going to bring it up. Relax. I know, I know the deal.</v>

160
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.800
<v 0>Well, thank you, Nick. Look at that.</v>

161
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.610
<v 1>I, why do you think, uh, UN AOC in 2028, all this stuff I have all these notes.</v>

162
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.530
No, I think that's that idea. Shouldn't be,

163
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.490
I don't want you to sound this wrong. Like, I shouldn't be a crazy idea to go.

164
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.960
We can't try this thing where you don't trust the government and you're sick of

165
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:39.741
them ruining your money.

166
00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:43.370
We can't trust the people with it just one time and see if the hell happens.

167
00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:46.070
Like w we, we tried out Trump,

168
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.770
like we wanted an outsider.

169
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.690
Why your idea should not be a crazy idea. When we give,

170
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.150
we waste money in the government so much,

171
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.430
they mismanagement mismanagement a lot and you know, let's give you,

172
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.420
we, you met all these people. You see that for the most part. They're good.

173
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.690
They want to do better people. Some people are going to blow it. Sure.

174
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.310
But that's life, you know what I mean?

175
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:13.070
Give them a chance because the government is going to blow most of it anyway.

176
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.600
So let's get a shot, you know?

177
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:15.741
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

178
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:19.640
We just lived at two when people got this $1,200 stimulus check back in April

179
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.270
and I dare say it was awesome. Like, people, people loved it.

180
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.230
Yeah. Know people, people like did what they did, but, uh, but, but,

181
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.390
but by the numbers, like, you know,

182
00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:36.350
it worked like there was a study that came out afterwards and it made me laugh,

183
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.510
Nick. It was like, like giving people a $1,200 reduced poverty. And I was like,

184
00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:45.980
yeah, it, it really did like great, great work.

185
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.880
Um, so, so yeah, like I, I think, uh,

186
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.850
I mean right now, um,

187
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.050
something like 75% of Americans are pro cash relief during the pandemic,

188
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.840
including majority of Republicans, I never contact. Everyone's like, look,

189
00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:03.320
this is common sense. Everyone's on board with us.

190
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.610
<v 1>It just seems like the elections in coming up.</v>

191
00:11:07.611 --> 00:11:11.900
So we all have to fight about if you can get $150 or $450,

192
00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:15.140
but nobody wants to lose points politically,

193
00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:18.800
which this is that part of the game where it's like, guys,

194
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.180
people are going to vote for Trump or buy it in how it's going to go give these

195
00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:26.840
people a couple hundred dollars for having to sit at home and shut down their

196
00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:28.130
business. Like, come on.

197
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.930
