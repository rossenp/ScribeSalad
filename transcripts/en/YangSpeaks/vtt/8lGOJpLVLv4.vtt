00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>The reason why I spent seven years running this</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.011
entrepreneurship,

3
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:08.400
nonprofit is I saw the numbers around declining entrepreneurship around the

4
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.140
country, and I thought that's a disaster.

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.460
And it was a disaster in terms of jobs and opportunities and the economy,

6
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.130
but it was also disaster socially or culturally,

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
because I had been formed myself like you as the head of

8
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:23.850
this small business.

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.810
And you're allowed to be a human being as the head of a small business,

10
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:29.610
you know, you're allowed to do things that are frankly,

11
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:33.820
not economically optimal. Um, just because you feel like,

12
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.960
because you're, you know, you like that person in your case, you were like,

13
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:37.411
guess what?

14
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:41.460
I'm going to pay you all 70 K it's like what I could have hired you for 40 K,

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.820
who cares? I gonna pay you 70 K cause I think it's the right thing to do.

16
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.450
And I think writ large, um, you know, w we'll benefit from it.

17
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:52.890
But also I just feel like it, and like the,

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.110
and there's like this market logic that over, uh,

19
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.670
overrides everything.

20
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:03.600
If you're a part of a very large corporation where you're not allowed to do

21
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:07.350
anything that's, um, economically irrational and thus human.

22
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.360
<v 1>Yeah. Well, and,</v>

23
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:13.190
and the problem with that is it's creating a level of conformity where

24
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.750
everyone's doing the same thing. I mean,

25
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.840
if you look at a lot of the decisions that I've made, made,

26
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:22.220
and continue to make their decisions that I learned through all these various,

27
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:25.670
like CEO learning organizations, peer to peer learning organizations,

28
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:29.480
and just a lot of business books, you know, everything out there is like,

29
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:32.180
there's only one way to do things. I mean,

30
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:35.210
a pretty recent example is like when the pandemic hit,

31
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:39.590
we lost 55% of our revenue because our 20,000 small business clients

32
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.080
lost 55% of their revenue.

33
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.150
And our revenue turns out is an exact function of theirs. And so basically,

34
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.420
you know, what we're taught and what you were taught, I'm sure as well.

35
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.100
And a lot of these same circles is you want to do a very hard cut

36
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.700
layoff early so that you can have a recovery story.

37
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.620
You want to cut deeper than you need to.

38
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.410
And then the next day you're back on the front foot,

39
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:07.340
you're back to hiring you're back to growth and you protect your balance sheet.

40
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:12.110
You're willing to sacrifice the people that got you here to protect your balance

41
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:12.441
sheet,

42
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:16.610
and then turn around and potentially bring new people on board or save the

43
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:20.480
company or whatnot. And so we're just taught in situations like this,

44
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:24.650
and you see it all over with Hertz and JC penny. And, you know,

45
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:28.370
I did like a Twitter thread even of like bankrupt companies that are doing all

46
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:33.080
these layoffs, giving huge bonuses to the CEOs or big companies. Uh,

47
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.910
like one of my competitors toast,

48
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.070
they just raised $300 million on a multi-billion dollar valuation.

49
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.450
And right afterwards, they laid off 50% of their team right after doing that.

50
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.040
And so we're just kind of taught that this is the only way of doing it and it's

51
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:52.940
hard. But I think when people make different decisions like we did, we said,

52
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:54.380
we're not going to lay anybody off.

53
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:56.420
We're going to find a way to get through this together.

54
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.850
There's actually a lot more benefit there than realize it's more viable.

55
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:05.260
And I think we're proving that every day, but yet kind of the orthodoxy,

56
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:09.430
if you just go around talking to people at cocktail parties or reading the books

57
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:09.971
or whatnot,

58
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:13.750
we're just told there's only one way to do it and it's clearly wrong.

59
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:18.220
So it kind of begs the question. Why are we being told that, um,

60
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.000
I think that we've convinced ourselves that people are not good,

61
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.300
that people are bad and capital and corporations are good.

62
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.410
And I think if you look at the data that I'm seeing in the experience, I have,

63
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.920
it's exactly the opposite. I mean, when we got hit by the pandemic,

64
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.630
our employees said we don't want anyone laid off and we don't want any increased

65
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:42.250
fees or decreased service for our small business clients. And they got together.

66
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.970
They asked for my permission, took some time, got together. And they said,

67
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:50.560
we don't want anyone to get an involuntary pay cut because maybe somebody just

68
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:54.100
had somebody else get laid off or had schools, uh, interrupted.

69
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.550
And all of a sudden expenses went up. So they said, we're gonna, we're gonna do,

70
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:01.030
we're gonna try to get together and do an anonymous, voluntary,

71
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:04.960
complete restructuring where people take anonymous pay cuts.

72
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.700
And we had 98% of the company asked to take a pay cut

73
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.150
anonymously just through this like code of like number this person.

74
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.100
And then they turned around pivoted and started working with 20,000 small

75
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:22.240
businesses that trust gravity to get them reopened and putting all these

76
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:23.290
solutions into place.

77
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:27.610
They did things like come up with like this app where like coffee shops can have

78
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:28.870
Starbucks type order,

79
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.130
had coffee where veterinarians can move the front desk to the car because we've

80
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:37.540
sent a text message that opens up and they can close out their folio and they

81
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:41.440
pivot and did all these things. And we're not going to make money for a while.

82
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:43.810
And I'm okay with that, but we're going to survive.

83
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.870
We're going to be able to keep helping these small businesses as long as they're

84
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:48.400
still around to be helped.

85
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.970
And I think that's an example where it was shocking to me because when the

86
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:55.530
employees pitch that to me is how we're going to recover as the CEO,

87
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.710
it just went against everything I was ever. We're taught in everything.

88
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:01.470
All of us are taught, which is we try to sell each other out.

89
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:05.430
We try to hurt each other, but that is the behavior of corporations.

90
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.940
And if we can actually empower people and, and in some ways,

91
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:13.740
disempower corporations, or at least spread out the power a little bit,

92
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.720
we're going to see more and more of that.

93
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:20.520
And I think because the corporations are so bad, people come across as bad.

94
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.280
If you deal with like a Comcast cast customer service rep,

95
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.590
they seem like a genuinely bad person.

96
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.340
And the reality is that person would do a fantastic job.

97
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.140
They're really good person if they weren't being so mistreated by the system and

98
00:05:34.141 --> 00:05:35.250
by their employer.

99
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.560
And so I think that the cause for optimism that I have is we actually don't

100
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.860
need to change people. We just need to change the system.

101
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:46.170
And the structure around people take away,

102
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:50.580
what's constraining them and then people, and then people will actually save us,

103
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.660
but we have to actually do it. And that's the hard pipe. Yeah.

104
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:58.520
We have to overrun, uh, like the corporate system.

105
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.290
<v 0>To give people a chance to bring out the best in</v>

106
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:08.030
ourselves. Um, and I a hundred percent agree with you that people,

107
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:12.410
if you believe in them, uh, like they expand,

108
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.870
it's wild. Like you believed in your people.

109
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.790
And then they believed in themselves. And then when dark times come,

110
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.730
they look around and say, okay, we can do something about this. Like, you know,

111
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:26.360
I'm not going to wait for like the boss to come and tell us what's up.

112
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.500
It's like, you know, like I care about you. I care about myself. Like, you know,

113
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.930
let's try and solve for this. Um,

114
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.350
but a lot of it was because you created that environment and you believed in

115
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.690
them, you know, the reverse is true too.

116
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:42.530
That if you're a part of an organization where they treat you like all the time,

117
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.630
you know, like dark times come, then you'll be like, Oh, no, like, like one,

118
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:49.880
I know they're going to get rid of me if they can. And to like,

119
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.970
maybe I'll like throw my colleague under the bus because it's going to be like

120
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:55.280
me or them. And like, you know, like that, like the,

121
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.120
and most Americans unfortunately are laboring under like the latter type of

122
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.080
situation or environment because of the corporate logic you're talking about.

123
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.980
It's like, if you had enough human leaders like yourself,

124
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.990
creating cultures where people believed in each other and ourselves and cared

125
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:14.330
about each other, then you could solve these problems.

126
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.310
<v 1>Well, and I think that's why it's so important to get messages out there.</v>

127
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:22.450
Like I worked so hard trying to get the story out there and people are like,

128
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:26.050
why do you do it? It's like, well, if these stories can get out, people can see,

129
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.350
like, people ask me all the time, how do you motivate your team? I'm like,

130
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.010
I don't try to motivate them. I try to not de-motivate them. Like,

131
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:35.920
I'm the bad guy in this equation. They're actually, they,

132
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:40.060
they will do great job just on their own. And most people will out there.

133
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.980
And so if we can take away that and invest instead in people's capability and

134
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:47.830
give them actual license and power. And,

135
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.640
but I feel like what we have to do is connect the dots between what you see

136
00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:55.930
happening at gravity, the story I'm out there sharing and what you're saying,

137
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.030
because we can look at these as experiments when we do what you're proposing in

138
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:05.860
small settings, companies flourish, or at a very minimum, they still do.

139
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.430
Okay. Like I'm still here. I'm still happy. I'm still doing fine.

140
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.620
And it's not like the entire,

141
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.760
the lie we've been told is that the entire economy and all of our jobs will go

142
00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:18.760
away. If we hold big companies accountable,

143
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.410
if we put people first and the opposite is true as a whole,

144
00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:26.830
we will thrive. Now, will some people be less wealthy? Absolutely.

145
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:31.450
And that's fine because when Jeff Bezos comes out and says he has to start a

146
00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:33.550
space company, because he has so much money,

147
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.240
it's the only thing where he can possibly spend even a tiny percentage of his

148
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:41.320
money that he cares about. That's a signal of like, Hey, actually,

149
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.150
he could take that same amount of money.

150
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.740
And he could pay 250,000 people that work in his warehouse, a living wage.

151
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.740
Those people could then invest in their skills and they could get better

152
00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:53.830
opportunities, not be held back. And those shifts,

153
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:58.590
if we can find a way to harness some of these stories and some of the data that

154
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:01.260
we're seeing, I think the proof is already there.

155
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.470
I just think we have to get the word out and then we'll be able to fix this.

156
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.830
<v 0>It's beyond vital. It's central. Uh, you know,</v>

157
00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:12.290
if you imagine a world where everyone's working for Amazon,

158
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.890
which that world is happening, I don't know if you only can sense it. I mean,

159
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.110
if you look at the Amazon employee count,

160
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:22.940
like it's shooting up just as all of retail is closing. So it's not one for one,

161
00:09:22.941 --> 00:09:25.340
unfortunately, like it's not like for every now worker,

162
00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:26.590
like they're hiring an Amazon work.

163
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.350
<v 1>They eliminate five jobs and make one and they say they're job creators.</v>

164
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.870
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And then they go around being like, Hey, look at,</v>

165
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.930
look at the jobs we created, like a, you know,

166
00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:38.420
we've got like all this good PR around it.

167
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:40.360
And we're going to yell at you about all the jobs that you're created.

168
00:09:40.361 --> 00:09:43.500
It's like, Hey, like, have you looked at the retail sector? Are you like you,

169
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.370
you know, that thing used to employ 11 million people,

170
00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:51.050
you employ 11 million people at Amazon. Like, no, but we,

171
00:09:51.051 --> 00:09:53.870
we employ, you know, whatever they employ like hundreds of thousands.

172
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.610
<v 1>It's heartbreaking too,</v>

173
00:09:55.611 --> 00:10:00.470
to see the way they put the computers in charge of the humans to Amazon that is

174
00:10:00.471 --> 00:10:02.300
really horrific to see. And there's, you know,

175
00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:05.120
there was that frontline documentary about this with Amazon,

176
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.350
but basically like they're the people, the computers tell them what to do.

177
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.000
And they want the people to act with the same ruthless form of efficiency that

178
00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:15.590
the robots and computers do.

179
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:20.210
And that's really horrific and heartbreaking to see because it dehumanizes those

180
00:10:20.211 --> 00:10:23.960
people that are working then when you don't pay a living wage, you know,

181
00:10:23.961 --> 00:10:25.520
it dehumanizes their home life.

182
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:28.880
So they have their work life de-humanized and their home life dehumanized at the

183
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:29.714
same time.

184
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.000
<v 0>Well, my friends at Amazon are very open. They say, you know,</v>

185
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:34.250
we're always trying to automate our own jobs away.

186
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.280
Like that's just the culture of the, uh, the org.

187
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:41.990
It's like an efficiency engine that place. Uh, and, um,

188
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.890
I mean, that's from Jeff on down like Jeff sort of like a,

189
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.740
like a zealot when it comes to, you know,

190
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.050
trying to get things done as efficiently as possible.

191
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:55.670
And that filters down pretty, pretty quickly. Uh,

192
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.380
and the antidote really is people going out and doing what they want to do in

193
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:02.300
their community, in the form of a small business,

194
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:05.270
and then treating their employees while treating their customers well,

195
00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:09.200
treating themselves. Um, well last, because in my experience,

196
00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:12.290
small business owners like have to look out for themselves after they look out

197
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:14.840
for everyone else under the sun. Um, but that's,

198
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.170
that's the only chance really, uh,

199
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.610
like this is the giant rebalancing I was concerned about and now pandemic has

200
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:26.270
sped us up. So that the stuff that, that, that Andrew Yang,

201
00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:29.810
like chicken little dystopian figure, like, uh, you know,

202
00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:34.010
all of a sudden it's with us right now. Um, I'm with you on being very,

203
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:36.390
very concerned about the timing. Dan it's like, like,

204
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.820
like this stuff is mission critical and needs to get passed yesterday.

205
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.690
Uh, and we don't have that much time. I mean, in my case,

206
00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:48.350
I'm obviously pushing for a change in leadership. Uh,

207
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.510
and I hope that if you had,

208
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.820
let's say one party in charge Congress and the white house,

209
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:57.850
they could get massive solutions across the, the, the,

210
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.500
the goal line that could hopefully help preserve a lot of these small

211
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:05.020
businesses and these jobs, um,

212
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.340
and the humans who have dedicated years,

213
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:12.730
decades of their lives to building them in many, many cases.

214
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.070
And that's the other part of it too, is that like,

215
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:18.970
if you dedicate decades of your life to something, and then you see it, uh,

216
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.530
disintegrate, you know, like that that's devastating.

217
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.210
<v 1>Yeah. It's crushing. And we, we need, I mean, right now we're, you know,</v>

218
00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:31.980
Congress is in recess and we need some type of relief for everyday people

219
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:36.960
for small businesses. Like we need to do something. And I just am like,

220
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.561
you know,

221
00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:41.220
like we D we don't want to see this change happen because it's going to be very

222
00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:45.150
hard to undo when so many of our small businesses are going under.

223
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.970
<v 0>As someone who's run a small business, you know,</v>

224
00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:50.670
it's not like you flip a switch, you know,

225
00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:55.050
like your employees all drift off and find other opportunities like your

226
00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:58.230
vendors, uh, you know, close down the line,

227
00:12:58.231 --> 00:13:01.950
like you sell the equipment or furniture, like, you know,

228
00:13:01.951 --> 00:13:05.550
you can't just be like, and I'm back, like in a lot of these cases.

229
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.060
<v 1>Well, and the small businesses make those individual choices.</v>

230
00:13:09.061 --> 00:13:12.060
As you highlighted earlier that are more human.

231
00:13:12.061 --> 00:13:15.930
They're more in line with the human centric economy that you've been championing

232
00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:18.540
that I've been championed because, you know, they go out there,

233
00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:20.760
they know those people. They're not making the,

234
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.600
they're not making the decision only based on what they saw in their business

235
00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:26.790
school class or what the spreadsheet says.

236
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.200
They actually know the decisions they make, how they impact real people.

237
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:36.630
And so if we want to make our economy more efficient and ruthless

238
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.700
at making all of our lives worse,

239
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.440
all we need to do is completely get dominated by all these large companies and

240
00:13:43.441 --> 00:13:46.080
monopolies. And if we want to stop that from happening,

241
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.350
we basically need to sell out and do whatever we need to,

242
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:53.400
to protect these small businesses, because they really are kind of,

243
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.700
as the Bible says, you know, a little bit of salt goes a long way.

244
00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:59.700
They are the salt for our economy, for our communities.

245
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.040
Having those small businesses still be around.

246
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.450
