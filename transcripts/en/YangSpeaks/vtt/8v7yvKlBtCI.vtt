00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>What is so important, is that from,</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.870
I think the private sector has a role to be looking for more

3
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:10.371
businesses,

4
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:13.680
at least as an investor to be looking for more businesses that are still using

5
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.950
technology, still software based or technology based businesses,

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.080
but that are scaling employment for empathetic or human type work.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.530
Um, and there's a bunch of new ones that I hope will be created.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.650
We backed a company called Papa. That's doing very well.

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:32.640
That's it's grandkids on demand, which sounds silly,

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.910
but with 10,000 boomers retiring every day,

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.590
and definitely not anywhere close to 10,000, like home health workers,

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.000
starting jobs every day,

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.250
there's a huge need for empathetic people who can spend an hour

14
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:49.680
at a time with the elderly,

15
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:52.170
doing everything from like helping them with their Netflix,

16
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:53.610
to just talking to them, right.

17
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:57.840
Loneliness is actually an epidemic and has health consequences.

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.520
And so health plans are more motivated than ever to bring on these Papa pals

19
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.100
to take time, to be with their patients,

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.640
to be with their members because it improves their health outcomes because it

21
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:13.620
actually helps bring more sort of data and feedback into the whole

22
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:15.540
conversation because they actually can say like, Oh,

23
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.790
you need to go to the doctor. Like, let me, let me drive you to the doctor.

24
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:19.410
Let me go help you pick up your medicine like that.

25
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.300
That solves a problem that we're not,

26
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.440
I personally don't think we're ever going to have empathetic,

27
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.900
like truly empathetic robots. Um,

28
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.660
Elan begs to differ on that one.

29
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:35.610
But for the time being there are still these jobs that are the domain of humans

30
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:38.610
and should always be, uh, that are variable.

31
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.340
<v 1>We're going to have, we have to delve into this alikes as humanity, as medicine,</v>

32
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.140
humanity, as elder care,

33
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:49.190
like that's staggeringly simple and

34
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:53.690
profound and important at the same time. Uh, like I, I want to hear more.

35
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:55.160
It's called pop-up APA.

36
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.860
<v 0>Yay. Um, and join papa.com is the website. Um, but what the CEO,</v>

37
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.810
so what Andrew realized was this didn't exist as a

38
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:09.830
type of work because it's not, these are not medical professionals.

39
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:13.910
These are not home healthcare AIDS who are doing drug administration and stuff.

40
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.910
These are just empathetic kind people.

41
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:18.740
And they go through diligence screening process.

42
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.930
A lot of them are actually sort of college age students

43
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:26.900
who are in or learning medical professions.

44
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.480
So if you are in nursing school,

45
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.450
you want to make some good money on the side.

46
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.630
Instead of say working that retail job at comp USA,

47
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.560
you're a Papa pal because it's actually helping you develop the skills that are

48
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:40.700
valuable for your career.

49
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.540
That only a human can go and it's work where you come home every day,

50
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:46.160
feeling amazing. Like I also,

51
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.370
I also worked at a pizza hut for a number of years as a cook and a waiter.

52
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.230
Like if I could have been a Papa pal instead of a pizza hut,

53
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:58.610
cook, I, sorry, pizza. I would have taken that 10 times over.

54
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.970
Like I have to smell like pizza every day. At the end of work,

55
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.710
I could smell like lavender or whatever the folks is home smell like

56
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.970
and actually feel really good about the work I did and make, make good money.

57
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.260
I think, you know, his instinct and it's only this,

58
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.550
company's only a couple of years old.

59
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.030
It's made great progress so far tracking very well.

60
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.820
And I think it is only a matter of time or in the next five years,

61
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.890
this will be a career option because the market will have properly valued this

62
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:27.550
time.

63
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.350
And the experts we're great at it that you can make a living as a Papa

64
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.430
pal. Like this will be a profession and it will be something that like,

65
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.980
as a society will already value because my God,

66
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.980
we don't do enough to support our seniors. So like it's easy.

67
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.480
Society is all very quick to be like, that's a good idea. And,

68
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.650
and then once the dollars follow that where, you know, off far too often,

69
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.570
we have a lot of these jobs where everyone agrees.

70
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:54.790
It's a great idea and really important, but the dollars aren't there,

71
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.950
he's going to make the dollars get there.

72
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.840
And an entirely new class of people who, you know,

73
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:06.040
are growing up and we can talk about higher education.

74
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.640
Maybe they decide that higher ed and the costs of incurring that,

75
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:13.000
assuming that doesn't change the debt that they would take on, isn't worth it.

76
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.810
And really what they want to do is just help people and help the elderly.

77
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.620
And this is a path to actually make a great living. Awesome.

78
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.270
<v 1>Everyone knows that there, that we have an aging population and like you said,</v>

79
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.720
like 10,000 people a day. Um, and, um, in,

80
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:32.280
in some idyllic vision that, uh, many of these older Americans are in pleasant,

81
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:34.950
community, retirement facilities and homes,

82
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:37.500
and they have grandkids that visit them on the regular and all this stuff.

83
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.830
But now when COVID, uh, even if you had grandkids who wanted to visit you,

84
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:45.660
they're not going to, uh, so then the need for companionship,

85
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.620
um, and help and, uh, you know, human company and contact, uh,

86
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:54.120
agree that it has a very, um, crucial health benefits.

87
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:55.560
So even on that level, you'd be like, well,

88
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.350
there's probably going to help maintain this. Person's, um,

89
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.410
like functionality for extra X number of years.

90
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.070
So under the Papa model who is paying.

91
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.270
<v 0>So you can do direct. So I like your,</v>

92
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:12.360
I could sign up and just do sort of the direct to consumer. It's like, Hey,

93
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:16.620
come, come visit my grandpa every week. And it's just build no problem.

94
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.970
Um, but where the real growth is, is actually from health plans.

95
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.420
So health plans, and these are folks who are very,

96
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:29.190
very motivated to keep their patients well. Right.

97
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.830
And, and it turns out for them,

98
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.870
it's invaluable because the more of this companionship they can create the more

99
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:40.830
of this assistance they create the healthier, the outcomes are, right.

100
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:45.060
We're only starting to scratch the surface on loneliness as an epidemic,

101
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.330
but the papers are getting published. There's a real health cost.

102
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.220
There's a loneliness. Yeah, for sure. I think now we all got a dose of it,

103
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.050
right? During COVID and the lockdowns,

104
00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.500
there are a lot of folks who are really way more empathetic with the

105
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.610
idea of an isolated senior than they've ever been myself included. Right.

106
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.700
<v 1>And so it sounds like the Papa pal is meant to visit them in person. Um,</v>

107
00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:13.750
so is there a ratio where it's like 80% digital, like a, you know,

108
00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:16.330
one visit a week? Like, what does that activity set look like?

109
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.380
<v 0>So this is an example, every, okay.</v>

110
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.330
If you ever a good question to ask every company next year and venture

111
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:27.730
investors are already asking this question, which is,

112
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:31.210
how did COVID affect your business and what was the,

113
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.420
like the there's going to be a very,

114
00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:37.000
just like that case shaped recovery in the economy broadly,

115
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.890
there are really it's at the extremes businesses either

116
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.020
had five years of what was going to be steady growth and adoption

117
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:51.190
compressed into five months of rapid growth or the opposite.

118
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.980
Papa ended up being one of the former.

119
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.080
They had virtual companionship as a small part of their business starting

120
00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:04.000
out, and COVID only accelerated the adoption.

121
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.190
So now they're, they're majority virtual.

122
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:09.880
So it started out a couple of years ago building the software so that like,

123
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:14.470
as a Papa pal, I could open my phone, have my appointments scheduled,

124
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.700
to hit a button. And like,

125
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.220
I'd see on the map where I drive to go visit their home. And that was a very,

126
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.560
you know, physical in person set up,

127
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.490
but COVID accelerated the adoption of virtual companionship.

128
00:07:27.491 --> 00:07:30.490
And so that is the dominant one now. And, you know,

129
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.240
for a generation of boomers in particular, they're all,

130
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:36.850
everyone's arms with a smartphone now. Um, you know,

131
00:07:36.851 --> 00:07:40.960
the last 10 years in particular have brought adoption to a level where yeah,

132
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:45.880
you know, a lot of folks are very comfortable with zoom and

133
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.380
FaceTime that we never would have expected, um, a lot faster. Um,

134
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.900
thanks to this sort of necessity of this and, and,

135
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.360
and pop has been a great beneficiary of it. And yeah,

136
00:07:55.361 --> 00:08:00.310
it turns out even the virtual companionship has the same outcomes

137
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.540
for patients. Um, things like I,

138
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.080
this is something I can't, and this is another one where you,

139
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:10.510
I think I take for granted having founded Reddit,

140
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.220
but I can't unsee how real

141
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.610
relationships are, even when they are digital,

142
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.680
even when they are total strangers,

143
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.020
even when you don't even know what the person looks like,

144
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.400
because I've seen that happen for 15 years on a platform where all you know is a

145
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:29.740
username and the text they write.

146
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.360
So if that exists and it's very strong and in some cases stronger, I mean,

147
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:35.080
there are,

148
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.820
there are people on the internet who don't know anything about fluffy bunny, 16,

149
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.770
other than that's their username.

150
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:45.580
And yet they have a closer relationship with them than the people they see at

151
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:47.620
the office or normally would see at the office every day.

152
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.650
<v 1>Well, I hope it's been established that you can build very,</v>

153
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:54.880
very strong relationships, uh, online, digitally, uh,

154
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:59.850
in different ways. I mean, heck there's that movie, her with Joaquin Phoenix,

155
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:01.350
like falling in love with his phone,

156
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:04.380
which I did not find to be that implausible.

157
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.930
It was like he had it like, you know, uh, and, and so,

158
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.030
so to use, uh, the consumer facing, um,

159
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.010
model as an example, let's say that I'm a very busy parent. Um,

160
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.770
I'll use myself screw it personally. So like, let's say I'm a very busy parent.

161
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:26.490
I've got parents who are aging. I can just sign up. Uh, I can be like, Hey,

162
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:31.470
great news. Uh, I've got some Papa pal, like for you, and then you like pick,

163
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.120
pick them up so you can get it as like a gift for your aging relatives.

164
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:40.470
And then they would just have someone who could minister to their, um,

165
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.510
tech questions. And cause I will say as a, an adult, um,

166
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.700
I get tech questions randomly from my parents.

167
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.540
<v 0>It's not the response from my step-mom about which Mac book she should buy.</v>

168
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.980
And yeah, no, I, and it's, it's tough too. Cause like I want to be,

169
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.850
I want to be a good kid, but I'm also like just Google it. You don't know.

170
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.950
<v 1>[Inaudible] real top of bell unit to get in there.</v>

171
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.990
<v 0>That helped out help us pop a pal that like that. And, and you know,</v>

172
00:10:14.991 --> 00:10:17.480
another interesting thing that I wouldn't have expected, I gave,

173
00:10:17.481 --> 00:10:21.740
I gave Andrew a hard time because he had a one 800 number on his website back.

174
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.530
It was just starting out and we were leading that round and I was like really a

175
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:26.360
one 800 number. And he's like, you don't understand,

176
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:30.380
like this is the way to do it. Yeah. You can sign up through the website,

177
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.840
but you put the one in a hundred number, trust me,

178
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.750
because it's going to help so much with, with, um,

179
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.500
onboarding and he's been absolutely right. Um, so yeah,

180
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.280
if you wanted to schedule the one 800, the Papa Valley,

181
00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:45.170
you could do it online or download the app or you could also just call one 800

182
00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:47.630
number because for a lot of their customers,

183
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:51.410
that's the most comfortable way to do it. And it's that,

184
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.590
that little thing like my,

185
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.970
my naivete slash arrogance in that moment of like really a one 800 number,

186
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:04.160
that is why I love entrepreneurship because the founder,

187
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.791
the CEO,

188
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:09.680
he knew he had to be humble enough to

189
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.660
go to where his users were or to build something that people actually wanted.

190
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.730
And you know,

191
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:20.150
the founders who are successful are the ones who can break out of their own bias

192
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:23.030
and actually empathize. And like, so in that moment as an investor,

193
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:27.350
I was clearly not empathizing well, but, but that's one of the things that is,

194
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.420
um, I think so needed right now because we have so many big problems to

195
00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:36.620
solve so many and the private sector can't do all of it. Let me also say,

196
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:38.360
I don't think the private sector can do all of it,

197
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.610
but there are areas where we need entire industries to be invented.

198
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:48.400
We need career like being a Papa pal to be invented. And,

199
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:53.380
and there's countless more because we need alternatives for

200
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:54.280
those jobs.

201
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 1>That are going to get largely automated. And, and I'm,</v>

202
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.640
I know this is not the entire solution, but it's a big part of it. And,

203
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.680
and that's really the impetus behind why I do what I do now,

204
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.570
because I need to help. As many of those things get started as possible. To me,

205
00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:13.570
the ideal vision Alexis is that, uh,

206
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.750
the government helps create incentives for the creation of these jobs and

207
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:17.950
industries. You know what I mean?

208
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.010
Cause like right now you look at it and you can find, uh,

209
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.720
an opportunity like Papa pal,

210
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:26.200
where there there's enough money currently heading into it where you can

211
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:28.180
actually build a business around it. Uh,

212
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:31.810
but there are other things where you look and say, Ooh, that should exist. Um,

213
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.380
but there aren't the monetary incentives in place right now. Uh,

214
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.220
and th this is where a lot of the no, um,

215
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.930
sustainability efforts go. It's like, well,

216
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:44.980
we all can see that we should be investing in a sustainable energy

217
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.700
products, but sometimes the money's not there because Hey, guess what?

218
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.320
Fossil fuels are really cheap right now and the rest of it.

219
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:54.430
And so like the ideal situation is the government actually helps create the

220
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.970
incentives so that people like you can invest in the innovators and

221
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:02.110
entrepreneurs who want to try and build these things. Um, even Papa pal.

222
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:05.800
When I think about, uh, why I was pressing on the, the, uh,

223
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.470
business model and the revenues were to me,

224
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:12.520
the social need for Papa pals, uh,

225
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.470
is sky high. And then the question is whether, uh,

226
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.270
the folks that need a Papa pal have a healthcare health plan provider,

227
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:24.130
that's smart enough to buy it,

228
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.970
have relatives that are smart enough to buy it and have the resources to do so.

229
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.120
Uh, you know, you can imagine a world where the government was like,

230
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.070
you know what, like, I'm not saying Papa pals the way, but like,

231
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.230
we're going to have like a, you know,

232
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:42.580
some stipend for anti loneliness measures and you can do whatever you want with

233
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:45.160
them. You can, you know, talk to friends, family,

234
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:48.430
you can like use a subscription service like this. I mean,

235
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.120
there is a world where we can actually start throwing, uh,

236
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.400
higher levels of resources at some of these problems,

237
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.060
but I couldn't agree with you more that it's innovators and entrepreneurs that

238
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:01.600
hopefully will, um, will give rise to the jobs we need.

239
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.120
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
