WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.550
<v 0>So I I'd love for you to,</v>

2
00:00:01.551 --> 00:00:06.450
to go back when you first decided to elevate everyone's salary to

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:09.930
70,000, which gained you national fame and accolades,

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.460
and you took a pay cut personally in order to make this

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.610
$70,000 salary floor possible.

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.071
<v 1>Yeah, well,</v>

7
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:23.150
I had been indoctrinated and all the things that you're saying that we both been

8
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:27.140
talking about in terms of kind of the system and how other companies think about

9
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:30.080
things, the supremacy of shareholders, all those things,

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.130
but it was going against what I was actually seeing with my own eyes.

11
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.470
And so in 2011,

12
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:40.340
I was really inspired by an employee who was telling me she wasn't making

13
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:43.670
enough. And she had to take a second job at McDonald's to afford,

14
00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:47.210
to be able to work at my company. And I'm like, yeah. And I'm like, you're like,

15
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.620
you're one of our best employees. Like if you can't afford to live your life,

16
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.810
what does that say about me? And so in 2011, at the end of the year,

17
00:00:56.811 --> 00:01:00.830
we set a goal to average, 15% raises in 2012.

18
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.450
And then that we thought would decrease the profit.

19
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.110
We were looking to rebalance the pie and make it more fair because that's what

20
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.350
we thought would happen based on everything that's set out there.

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.400
But our profit actually went up. So we decided, well, we'll do it one more time.

22
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.110
Only in 2013. And we did it again. We exceeded the goal, our profit went up,

23
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:22.820
so that was happening every year.

24
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:26.900
And we thought this is the way to run a business. And in 2015,

25
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:29.120
we did a survey across our whole company.

26
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.450
And people were generally pretty pleased with how we were structured,

27
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.950
but I went on a hike with my friend, Valerie, who was in the army for 11 years.

28
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.340
And she's such a hard worker and such an amazing person.

29
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.260
And she was explaining to me how a $200 rent increase was throwing her entire

30
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:48.470
life upside down. And I was like, that doesn't make any sense.

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.120
You're one of the best people I know,

32
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:53.870
like how is this possible that you're not being compensated fairly?

33
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.690
And then I learned something very inconvenient,

34
00:01:56.691 --> 00:02:00.410
which was a third of my employees were making less than what Valerie was making

35
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:01.244
at that time.

36
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.570
She was making about 40 K and our lowest employees were like 30 or

37
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:08.540
35. And it was just,

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.420
it was just heartbreaking for me.

39
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.490
And I seen like the Daniel Conaman Angus Deaton study about how like,

40
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.420
you know, wellness increases with income until it doesn't.

41
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:25.310
And I'd read all these things, but ironically, and I'm not proud of this.

42
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.710
It took almost like emotional purse,

43
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.390
personal experience where this person that I genuinely like love and care about

44
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:37.370
and respect so much was not being taken care of by our economy

45
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.350
where I realized I was, I had built a company where I can make decisions,

46
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.320
and yet I was just following what everyone else was doing.

47
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:49.700
What was hurting her rather than doing what I think any five-year-old would know

48
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.700
would be the right thing in that situation. Well.

49
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.650
<v 0>Channeling your inner five-year-old Dan,</v>

50
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:59.150
because you then became a national hero in some circles, my circles,

51
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.690
uh, when you said, you know what,

52
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.550
we're gonna make sure that everyone who works for this company gets paid $70,000

53
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:10.090
minimum, which happens to track with about the income level,

54
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.280
where money no longer affects happiness,

55
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.420
because you would have now have enough to meet your everyday needs.

56
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.350
<v 1>Yeah. And I would also say that, like, I, I appreciate you saying that.</v>

57
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:22.830
I think,

58
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.270
I think ideally we would have a world where I don't get so much credit for doing

59
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:31.770
this and I think I get way too much credit. And it was shocking to me, you know,

60
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.490
somebody that grew up in Idaho and like getting on the local Idaho news would be

61
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:37.920
like being a celebrity in my world. Like let alone,

62
00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:42.300
like the New York times and all these other places I'm talking to you. And I,

63
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.330
it, it caused me to reflect and be like, why is this happening?

64
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:49.290
And I don't think it's happening because I'm such a great person.

65
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.153
I think it's just.

66
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.900
<v 0>Cause everyone else is so.</v>

67
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.340
<v 1>It's an indictment on the system. I mean, it is, it is funny,</v>

68
00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:00.450
but it's true.

69
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:04.050
It's an indictment on the system that somebody that just does something very

70
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:08.460
logical, like says, Hey, all of us built this together. Shouldn't all of us,

71
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.500
at least be able to enough to live like a normal life that that is so radical

72
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:17.160
and noteworthy, um, is really shocking to me. And I think, uh,

73
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.880
we should be somewhat ashamed as a society that that's where we're at right now.

74
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.280
<v 0>There are certain organizations where I completely think they</v>

75
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.800
could have done what you've done like a while ago.

76
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.630
So some of these organizations that are now incredibly wealthy and

77
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:37.980
valuable, and oftentimes the leader ends up hoovering up.

78
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.180
The lion's share of that value in these situations. Uh,

79
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.200
I can relate to a lot of your story Dan, in that. Uh,

80
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:50.250
but this is one thing I will suggest is that your business,

81
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.580
it was in a situation where if you invested more in your people,

82
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.650
then it spurred more growth, better oppor, better morale,

83
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.120
better retention, uh, more creativity. Um,

84
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.600
I ran an organization that was in a similar boat where if you're a growth

85
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:10.350
company and you invest in your people, then you end up growing more.

86
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.450
It's like this magical relationship. And, and I'm proud to say that,

87
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.910
uh, no, I, uh,

88
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.440
was following some of your playbook during that time where I would pay people,

89
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.910
uh, more, there was always like a level where you kind of sensed cause you know,

90
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.580
you're the CEO of a small business. Like you kind of get it. It's like,

91
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.000
I know I can get you for this much, but I don't,

92
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.880
I'm going to pay you a little more than that because I think you're going to be

93
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:40.800
just happier, like better, more productive, less stressed out, more content.

94
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.370
Like I also was always like, whatever. I think I can get them for. Like,

95
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:47.070
I'm going to like go a little bit above that and it's good.

96
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.580
<v 1>For us, right? If we're like engaging with them and they're a little happier,</v>

97
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:53.010
a little less stressed out than we're happier and less stressed out.

98
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.710
<v 0>That's true. I wired the same way you are, which is like,</v>

99
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.410
I want the people around me to be happy.

100
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.700
You don't want them not to be stressed out about it. $200 rent increase. Like I,

101
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:06.200
you know, like I think that would just be better for us all. And in my case too,

102
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:08.390
I did some things where, uh,

103
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.210
and this is one of the joys of being a small business owner where I was like,

104
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.810
you know what? Like, we should all go to the beach. I'm going to rent a house.

105
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.860
It's gotta be a big house to accommodate everybody. And that'd be like,

106
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:23.660
everyone bus us to the beach or I want to take everyone skiing or whatever the

107
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:28.370
heck it was. Uh, those were the days. I mean, I I'm still missing them.

108
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.170
Like, uh, my, my now wife and I were dating during this time.

109
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.970
And she also was like, Oh, I miss those days because like this and,

110
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.670
uh, you know, you're positive. You want to look out for people.

111
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.680
I will say I'm sympathetic to folks who run certain types of

112
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:50.000
operations and other industries where frankly like that relationship might not

113
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.240
apply. Where if like you invest more in your people,

114
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.040
like maybe you're in like a no growth, uh, environment

115
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.120
that then you're like kind of managing now that that's,

116
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.890
I think most businesses are in situations where they would benefit from treating

117
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.220
people better, higher morale, like higher contentment, lower turnover,

118
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.360
like the vast majority of business, I believe fall in this camp. Uh, and I'm,

119
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.520
I'm happy to say that. Uh,

120
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.870
I think that you and I had similar kinds of experiences as the heads of small

121
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:21.704
companies.

122
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.930
<v 1>I'll say though, in our industry, if you look at our competitors,</v>

123
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.650
they have done massive numbers of layoffs.

124
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.900
They've increased the fees that they charge to small businesses in opaque ways

125
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:38.110
that those businesses can't understand or can't see right away.

126
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:40.540
So they can't be held accountable very quickly.

127
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.080
And then there are some companies that are doing a lot of great innovation,

128
00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:47.710
but those companies are telling their shareholders that they're going to turn

129
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:52.480
around and flip the switch at some point and start to charge those customers a

130
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:56.290
lot more or like start to figure out how to control costs in the ways that

131
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.130
you're describing.

132
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.960
And I feel like I did get kind of something wrong in terms of my

133
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:06.160
expectations over the past six years. And that is, I thought, you know,

134
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:08.740
with all the hubbub and how, you know,

135
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.570
kind of how much attention we were getting,

136
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.270
if we came out and prove that this could work,

137
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.930
that we would have a lot of people following suit. And we have had, you know,

138
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:21.220
dozens of companies follow suit and maybe some, some others in big ways,

139
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:24.400
but like generally the problems gotten worse. And just,

140
00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:27.850
if I can get up on my soap box for two minutes and highlight some of the success

141
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:32.590
we've had, I mean, we've tripled as a company in the past five and a half years,

142
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.850
we have 10 X, the number of babies being born at the company per year,

143
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.100
like we've had 50 or 60 babies.

144
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.090
<v 0>Oh, you have that as a measurement. It's like people are feeling reproductive.</v>

145
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.710
<v 1>10 X. The number of first-time homeowners, uh,</v>

146
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:50.470
70% of the people at the company have gotten out of debt.

147
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:52.960
30% say they've gotten completely out of debt,

148
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:57.480
but 70% have paid down debt and people have between doubled and tripled their

149
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:58.800
savings for retirement.

150
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.780
And I think there's real implications here for UBI because the raise that they

151
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:08.160
got is about the same raise that a thousand dollars times two adults in a home

152
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.130
would get. And most of the people that work at gravity there are,

153
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.240
they are two adult homes. So I think there's implications there. So I thought,

154
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:15.481
you know,

155
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:19.980
we prove all of that and you would see this general macro economic trend of

156
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.690
people thinking in this direction.

157
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.390
But I think we've actually proven the opposite.

158
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.820
And I think just the fact that the story is still big.

159
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.030
I think we've proven that people aren't going to do it voluntarily more than

160
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:34.410
anything else, because we've shown it can work. We've shown where like,

161
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.770
you know, we're still, we're still here. Like we're, I'm not poor.

162
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:42.270
Like I'm out surfing and playing music and you seem very happy and healthy,

163
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.990
yeah. Have a great life. And yet still nobody's doing it.

164
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.850
And so it's really actually emboldened my perspective on what you're

165
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:55.800
doing because I've realized I'm not the answer. I mean,

166
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:56.790
maybe I'm the answer in that.

167
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.420
I can be a part of the story and encouraging people and sharing what I've

168
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:01.860
learned, sharing what I know,

169
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.750
but we need to all come together behind these types of systemic

170
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:11.370
solutions. And we can't keep glorifying individual. One-offs like me.

171
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.450
<v 0>Freaking, man, I want to give you a hug.</v>

172
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.130
<v 1>I would love a yang hug right now. This guy gives the best hugs for everybody.</v>

173
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.250
<v 0>Wow. That's so kind of you, you do, uh,</v>

174
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.580
because what you just said is so important where there,

175
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:29.030
there was like a period and I spent, uh, you know,

176
00:10:29.031 --> 00:10:33.200
seven years or so trying to make something positive happen with venture for

177
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.080
America and entrepreneurship. And I thought something similar. I was like,

178
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:40.760
if I could just show people that helping these small businesses grow is just a

179
00:10:40.761 --> 00:10:44.750
better path than heading to the

180
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.550
billion dollar bank or the, you know, consulting company or whatever the heck.

181
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.620
Then we could really start to fix things and incredibly proud of

182
00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:57.080
everything that venture for America continues to do.

183
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.390
But I started realizing that the black holes gravity field at

184
00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:06.320
this point is way, way too strong and that, uh,

185
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.750
the software of

186
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.550
our economy that so many people have internalized that, you know,

187
00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:18.320
we're all economic inputs and that if you're a company you have to try and like,

188
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.350
get it down to the very last penny,

189
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.050
you can get away with that as soon as you can.

190
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.870
And as soon as you can throw someone over board,

191
00:11:26.871 --> 00:11:30.560
you definitely should throw them over where like all of these things are so

192
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:32.600
deeply entrenched, uh,

193
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.590
not just in the operations of these companies,

194
00:11:36.591 --> 00:11:40.400
but in our society and people's minds. Um,

195
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:45.410
then I realized that we actually need to rewrite the rules of the economy, um,

196
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.900
both from the ground up and the top down simultaneously,

197
00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:51.500
but the top down component required control of the government.

198
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.920
And then I was like, well, how do you get of the government?

199
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.850
And then it's like run for president and wind and have the movement or the

200
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:02.650
revolution it's like, and that most people watching this know, uh,

201
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.390
would have been a highly irrational ambition circa 2018. When, you know,

202
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.310
Andrew Yang was a, an anonymous, um, entrepreneur.

203
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.750
Um, but it it's born of the same kind of arc that you went through Dan,

204
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:19.660
because you think, okay, if I can demonstrate this works,

205
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.990
then everyone will be like, well, it works. Let's all treat our people better.

206
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.050
Then when you're like, Oh,

207
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.970
people really won't treat their employees better unless they get dragged to it,

208
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:32.170
kicking and screaming.

209
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.040
And the only way to drag them to a kicking and screaming would be to actually

210
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:37.330
get ahold of government and change them.

211
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.280
<v 2>The rules. Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation.</v>
