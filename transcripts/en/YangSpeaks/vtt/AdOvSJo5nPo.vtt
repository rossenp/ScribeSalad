00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>My parents raised me or my stepmom was the daughter of the American revolution.</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.760
And my father, who is an immigrant from Alexandria Egypt.

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:13.560
And I'd spent a lot of my summers in Alexandria with my grandmother who never

4
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.350
got to go to school despite being one of the wisest people I've ever met.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.270
And she made a habit of reminding me that there was nothing special about me.

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.150
There was only something special about my opportunities.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.170
She pointed out one cousin and be like, you know,

8
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:28.120
that was smarter than you point out to another one. She said that one's is,

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.470
is better looking than you pointed out to a third one that was taller than you.

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.850
And her point was that you owe your opportunities a responsibility.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.420
And I think that that's one of the best things about being the child of

12
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:44.400
immigrants is that I know exactly what opportunities I had because I saw the

13
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.180
contrapositive. And so the crazy thing is that on those trips to Egypt,

14
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:53.070
I would travel about 15 hours and travel about 10 years

15
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:54.330
difference in life expectancy.

16
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.200
And I could travel the same tenure life expectancy gap in 25 minutes.

17
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.430
If I were to leave my suburban Detroit home and drive to any neighborhood in

18
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:06.330
Detroit, and that always framed why I became a doctor in the first place,

19
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:07.770
the work that I wanted to do.

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.670
<v 1>One of the things in your story that impressed me the most.</v>

21
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.590
And there are a lot of very impressive things,

22
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.640
but so you're married in New York,

23
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.890
you're a professor at Columbia,

24
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.610
and then you wound up dropping everything to go back to Detroit,

25
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.500
to run the department of health.

26
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.430
That at that point was really poorly resourced. You know,

27
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:30.170
you had to like go and, uh,

28
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.860
you had to be a apart from your wife.

29
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.870
That to me is in many ways the biggest Testament to

30
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:43.310
your spirit of service because you and I

31
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:47.180
know a lot of people who came through the meritocracy and had like the

32
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:50.450
opportunity to teach it at Ivy league universities and whatnot,

33
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.970
and not many of them do what you did.

34
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.930
<v 0>Well, I, I appreciate you saying that. I, um, you know, for me,</v>

35
00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:00.950
that was just that that's the responsibility I owed the opportunities that I was

36
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:04.370
given. And so it's easy to get too complex about your,

37
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.950
your personal calculations, right? Should I do this? Should I do that?

38
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.520
But for me that the simple litmus test is what would my Tate, I think, right?

39
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:15.290
What would she say about what I chose to do and whether or not it was worthy

40
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:18.950
of the very unique opportunities that I got. And so that's why I did it.

41
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.350
I hope that that focus remains always for me,

42
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:23.780
that sense of dignifying your opportunity,

43
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.310
because you do something you talk about quite a bit in, in your work, Andrew,

44
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.610
and something I really admired about the clarity of your run is that at the end

45
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:36.050
of the day, you, your privilege is always creating privilege somewhere.

46
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.170
You're either increasing privilege for people who already have it,

47
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.130
or you're providing a modicum for people who don't and like, that's the choice.

48
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.430
So, you know, you, you work up the meritocracy, you, you get,

49
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.820
you get knighted by all these institutions who put their seal of approval on

50
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:54.470
you. And the question you have to ask yourself is, well, is what you're doing.

51
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.040
You know, what the was that for exactly? What was the point? Well.

52
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 1>We'll see, here's the thing. If, if I say to someone, Hey, Abdul,</v>

53
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.520
or doctor twice over Abdul,

54
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.990
El-Sayed goes home to Detroit to run the department of health. People say, okay,

55
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.170
that sounds very like important and official,

56
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.870
but I know what the reality is. Just like,

57
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.780
you know what the reality is where you like show up in Detroit,

58
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.670
you have this skeleton crew in the back of the parking office,

59
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.410
like the hospital that used to house,

60
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:31.150
it is shuttered your first task as like the person trying to increase people's

61
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.800
life expectancy is to deal with a Vagrant dog problem because the freaking dogs

62
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.230
are like roaming the streets of Detroit.

63
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.080
And I spent a lot of time in Detroit and even, I didn't know that one,

64
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:44.380
I was like, what? Like you had a freaking, uh, you know, it's like,

65
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.450
there's like the official storybook version.

66
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:47.890
And then there's like the real life version.

67
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.960
And I know what the real life version looked like.

68
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:52.330
Having spent enough time in that city.

69
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.880
<v 0>I was working,</v>

70
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.810
I was working probably 110,

71
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.030
120 hour weeks.

72
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.310
I got a little studio in downtown and I'd be in the

73
00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:09.420
office by eight. I'd leave the office by nine or 10.

74
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.810
And I would do that six to seven days a week.

75
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.910
And like the only time that I wasn't there,

76
00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:19.650
I was in New York where I would generally be with Saraj. But like,

77
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.520
if she was a, she was a resident physician. And so she had weekend hours and,

78
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.791
you know,

79
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:26.990
I would need to get out and just keep working because things kept going.

80
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.570
There were a lot of days where I was like, what are we doing here? Um,

81
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.170
that's just impossible. You're right. Like, you know, you walk in a,

82
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:36.240
and you've got five city employees,

83
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.660
85 contractors in the back of the building where people go to pay parking

84
00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:43.770
tickets in the poorest city in America. I I'll be honest. I, you know,

85
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:45.450
I've done a number of things since,

86
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:50.070
but I don't know that I'll ever be as fulfilled in a job as I

87
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.220
was in those moments, uh, at the health department,

88
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:56.910
because it was the thrill of doing something unique for people who really,

89
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:58.290
really needed it.

90
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.700
And rarely is work that unencumbered morally.

91
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.280
<v 1>Yeah, it'd be so pure. You're literally, it's like, Hey,</v>

92
00:05:05.281 --> 00:05:10.170
I'm just here to try and make your kids life longer and healthier.

93
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.770
Uh, and, and one of the stories I loved in your book is like,

94
00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:16.170
you just sort of show up at people's doorsteps on like Friday afternoons being

95
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:20.970
like, Hey, like what's going on? Like, what's going wrong in your neighborhood.

96
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.130
One of the things that broke my heart was the fact that you identified that

97
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.540
demolishing buildings in Detroit actually contributed to an increased risk of

98
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:33.870
lead poisoning for the kids who are near the demolished houses,

99
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.880
because so Detroit peak population, 1.7 million,

100
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.480
right. Current population, approximately 680,000, that's right.

101
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.530
Something along those lines. So the thing is almost two thirds empty.

102
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.330
So you'll look around and the way Detroit's laid out is that it's a fairly large

103
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.440
area. It's not like ILO Manhattan is like super densely populated.

104
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:58.010
It's like fairly spread out. It's huge. You could fit all.

105
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.760
<v 0>Of Boston, Manhattan and San Francisco and Detroit and still have room leftover.</v>

106
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.490
Yeah.

107
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.980
<v 1>Yeah. So it it's kind of spread out and it's almost two thirds empty.</v>

108
00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:10.720
So you have all these buildings that are derelict, uh,

109
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.520
hazardous bladed. So the fact that they were trying to demolish them,

110
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.470
I was for the fact that unfortunately the building materials have had

111
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.420
lead paint on them, such that if you demolish them, lead dust goes up and, uh,

112
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.430
probably ends up increasing health risks for people for blocks around

113
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:32.950
particularly vulnerable kids. I was like, Oh no,

114
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:36.580
I got like real sinking feeling. And the fact that you identified that,

115
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.601
you know, to me,

116
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:42.370
was so profound because I know the people in charge

117
00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.740
were very excited about demolishing some buildings.

118
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.740
<v 0>And that's the thing that the demolitions, weren't the problem. When you,</v>

119
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.090
when you demolish at that scale,

120
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.020
it's almost impossible to hold all of the contractors who are actually doing the

121
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:55.300
demolishing accountable. And so, you know,

122
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.120
of course they're going to cut corners and they're going to cheat.

123
00:06:58.121 --> 00:07:02.110
And when they do that means that the lead that was, you know,

124
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.220
packed away in the inside of those homes gets out and, you know,

125
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.730
you've got a kid playing outside or a kid opening the window and trying to study

126
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:12.910
in the room, that's going to get in their lungs. And that has consequences.

127
00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:15.910
And unfortunately, when we analyzed it, that's what we found.

128
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:18.400
And so it was really frustrating, right? Because you know,

129
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:22.900
this is a high profile program, a program that has a lot of money going into it,

130
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.760
and nobody wants to hear bad news,

131
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.520
but this sort of gets to the beginning of the conversation that we had, Andrew,

132
00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:29.050
which is in public health.

133
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.980
The hard part about public health is that if you're allowed and you ring the

134
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:37.630
alarm bells, right. People are like, yeah, this is, this is not a big deal.

135
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.500
Right. It's going to be just fine. And if you're quiet, then bad things happen.

136
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.140
And so you're constantly fighting a losing battle.

137
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:47.080
And here we are in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic,

138
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.330
that really is the same story, Alex Azar,

139
00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:51.520
for all of the things I disagree with him on, right.

140
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.400
Tried to ring the alarm bells about this pandemic. Well,

141
00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:58.620
before it became a global pandemic and they shouted him down, right. They, they,

142
00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:02.170
they shushed him up and here we are. And so, you know, I know that experience,

143
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:02.321
right.

144
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:05.890
I literally got called Cassandra by the higher ups in the office because every

145
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:08.140
time I'd come in, I'd be like, look, I've got bad news for you.

146
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.600
And let me tell you how this is gonna hurt kids. And they'd be like, Oh, well,

147
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:10.900
you know,
