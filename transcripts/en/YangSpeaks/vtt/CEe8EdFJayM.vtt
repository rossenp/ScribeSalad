WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>So the democratic party to me,</v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:06.600
and this is one of the things that it's fascinating about your story.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.010
So you are one of the most prominent progressives in the state of Kentucky. Uh,

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.280
you've identified the real issues that people care about.

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.690
People will listen to you because they sense that you're a different voice

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.530
and the Democrats not being complete morons. We're like, Hey,

7
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:24.570
we should try and recruit him. Like, wait,

8
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:26.340
we should recruit this guy to run for office.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.940
And you get asked about it every single cycle, which makes sense,

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.110
because you would be one of the most successful prospects that they could

11
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.870
possibly field. And you went so far as to attend, uh, uh,

12
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.790
one of those congressional candidate, uh, training camps. Um,

13
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.640
and after you went through that, you said, you know what,

14
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:48.840
I'm not sure I'm going to run, run that cycle. I think it was 16, uh,

15
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.610
when they were talking to you. Uh,

16
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:55.590
so tell us about why you took a hard look

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.570
and what your experience was.

18
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.700
<v 1>Well, so I do a radio show every day and I would argue,</v>

19
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:06.650
I am probably one of the only people in the country who is a progressive and an

20
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.310
outspoken progressive that speaks to a conservative audience every day,

21
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.130
70% of 75% of my audience are Trump voters.

22
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.540
And that's because that's the sports audience in Kentucky and they know I'm a

23
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:19.850
progressive, but they're okay with me because they think,

24
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.620
I think they think my heart is in the right place. So in 2016,

25
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.370
they called me up to consider running against Andy BARR in the congressional

26
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:32.540
district that represents Lexington, Kentucky, and long story short.

27
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.260
They asked me to come to this congressional boot camp where they teach people

28
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:37.130
how to run.

29
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.050
And I went there and I was with the 50 to 60 candidates that were in the swing

30
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:44.960
districts that you had to win the sort of purple districts.

31
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
And it included a lot of names of people that you would know.

32
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.770
And they basically did a three-day camp on how you win.

33
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.690
And it was the most depressing thing I have ever been a part of because my

34
00:01:56.691 --> 00:02:00.440
theory, my thought was, okay, they're going to teach you how to campaign,

35
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.950
how to talk about issues. They're going to talk about, you know, what would you,

36
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.550
what's a good policy to have on this or that? None of that was a conversation.

37
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.650
No one Andrew even asked me what I believed on anything ever.

38
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.780
I mean, they just thought, well, you could win. So you should come and run.

39
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.220
I could have believed any, anything in the world and they wouldn't have known,

40
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.120
they didn't care. They just thought I could win. And at the bootcamp,

41
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.870
all they taught you, literally all they taught you was how to raise money.

42
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.790
The whole thing was about money.

43
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.500
A very prominent congressperson stood up and said, let me tell you what,

44
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:40.820
doesn't matter. Meeting with voters, doesn't matter. Your policies don't matter.

45
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.803
What matters,

46
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.620
what matters is how much money can you raise and how do you utilize it?

47
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.920
And when I heard her say that I knew I wasn't gonna run. Cause I was like,

48
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:49.760
I'm not going to do this.

49
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:54.110
This is such a terrible part of potentially being in office.

50
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:56.000
And in Congress, especially in the house,

51
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.250
you have such little power that they just see you as a number to get to a

52
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:04.090
majority. And I came home and I almost said,

53
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.760
you know what I'm done with politics, period. It was that depressing.

54
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.180
Now I didn't do that, but it really showed me.

55
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:12.130
And I'm sure the Republicans have the same thing.

56
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.360
It really showed me that at least at that level, it's not about issues.

57
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.140
It's not about anything except raising money and getting the vote to get the

58
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.500
majority. I'm the numbers guy.

59
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.360
<v 0>Mad. And they probably told you this at the bootcamp. Um,</v>

60
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.650
but the average successful congressional candidate raises and spends

61
00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:35.640
$1.6 million, uh, on their campaign.

62
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.860
So you have to ask yourself, okay,

63
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.150
who the heck can raise $1.6 million for a congressional campaign.

64
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.270
But that's the reason they think the way they do. They're just like, well,

65
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:48.660
let's say you're a great human being. You have great vision. Uh, you know,

66
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:53.160
people really connect with you, but can you get $1.6 million? Uh,

67
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.770
and if not, then none of your personal qualities will care. They,

68
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.790
they become very, uh, very mechanical.

69
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.810
<v 1>So, I mean, do you believe that? Cause I don't. Do you believe that?</v>

70
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.363
Do I believe.

71
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.881
<v 0>Leave that,</v>

72
00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:12.450
that the average congressional candidate candidate that's exceeds raises 1.6

73
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.283
billion?

74
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.310
<v 1>Let's let's talk about what happened here in Kentucky during the Senate primary,</v>

75
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.630
I got named Charles Booker, who I endorsed and really liked a lot,

76
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.710
nearly pulled off one of the most shocking primary upsets ever against Amy

77
00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:26.130
McGrath,

78
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.150
Amy McGrath raised she's raised like $50 million for the Senate campaign.

79
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.141
At one point,

80
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:35.880
Charles Booker had like $30 in the bank and Booker got the

81
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.430
spark, mostly via social media.

82
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.060
And the money came after and I'm sort of, of the belief.

83
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.110
Now you need a base money or at least a base presence or a social media,

84
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.590
something, but the money for Charles he would have had,

85
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.970
if he had gotten the nomination,

86
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:54.570
he'd had all the money he needed against Mitch McConnell. Anybody. Heck yes.

87
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.900
Yeah, but he basically just,

88
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:01.950
once he got the spark and people knew who he was, he raised a lot of money.

89
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:04.590
And if he had had one more week left in the election,

90
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:06.750
he would have been the nominee and done very well.

91
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.300
I think against McConnell may not have beaten him, but he'd been closed.

92
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.400
I don't agree that it should be about who can have the most money.

93
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:18.720
Because I think Steve Bannon, who I think is a contempt contemptible person,

94
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.790
but he said, one thing I think is right,

95
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.350
which is actually think arguing art weirdly money almost matters less now

96
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.760
because there are so many ways to get it. And when you get to big races,

97
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:33.180
you'll get it anyway because people will want you to win.

98
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.910
So I don't know that I totally agree with that,

99
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:39.360
that like you gotta have that 1.6 million or why even do it.

100
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.110
<v 0>I agree with your disagreeing. Uh, and Charles is a great example.</v>

101
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.940
Candidates matter, candidates matter a great deal. You know, it's, it's,

102
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.340
it's one of the things that, uh, prompted me to run was I thought,

103
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:54.320
you know what? Like, I,

104
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:57.560
I think that this message needs to get out there and I think people will with it

105
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.840
and I believe I'll get the resources I need.

106
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.840
And I could've lived with myself if I hadn't, you know what I mean? It's not,

107
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.620
it's not like you could look at it and say, you can't know.

108
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.720
That's one of the things about these races too.

109
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:10.680
And you hit the nail on the head with Charles. Like,

110
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.060
like if Charles puts himself out there,

111
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.970
then he has a chance to get the resources he needs. You know, it's like,

112
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:21.020
can you know that someone ahead of time is going to get the resources? Sure.

113
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:24.110
In some cases, if they're just sitting on a giant pile of money, uh,

114
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:27.410
but the vast majority of candidates are going to have to put themselves out

115
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:29.060
there and hope that they catch that spark.

116
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.900
And then when they do catch that spark, then magical things can happen.

117
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.860
And those are the things that make the DC establishment, uh,

118
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.770
look up and be like, Oh, I did not see that coming. Um,

119
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.210
what's happening in the Senate race too. And I'd love to hear what your take is.

120
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.610
Uh, so Amy McGrath,

121
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.330
I believe had tens of millions of dollars for the primary.

122
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:52.820
She was already spending money on TV ads and the rest of it.

123
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.360
No one expected Charles to, um, challenge her seriously.

124
00:06:56.361 --> 00:07:00.530
And then it became very serious where he almost took the, uh,

125
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.640
nomination and she squeaked it out. And then now Charles,

126
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.610
and everyone's behind her because you got to try and beat Mitch. Um,

127
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.500
but it seems like she is not as close as you'd hope. Uh,

128
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.990
last thing I saw, I had her down like nine or 10 points.

129
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.330
So why is it that people in Kentucky are not excited about Amy and I, you know,

130
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:23.000
I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth, but you know, like,

131
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.270
I don't know if you agree with the fact that people aren't excited. I mean.

132
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.390
<v 1>I don't want to be negative towards Amy because I think she is a good person,</v>

133
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.550
but I she's going to lose by 20.

134
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.140
I really believe that 15 to 20 in Mitch,

135
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:43.000
please I wrote about, I actually was thinking about that race seriously.

136
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:47.350
I mean, not just kind of thinking about it. I went into it, I did polling.

137
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.350
I put my own personal money into looking at it and I detailed

138
00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:53.920
pretty, you know,

139
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.760
specifically how it is that candidates end up not running.

140
00:07:57.761 --> 00:08:01.480
And this is no offense to Amy McGrath, but my race is an example.

141
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.670
So I was considering running and Chuck Schumer and the DSCC decided Amy

142
00:08:06.671 --> 00:08:07.870
McGrath is going to be our candidate.

143
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.090
And what that was meaning was I could not even get people,

144
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.350
Andrew to work for me. There are nine polling, uh,

145
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.090
democratic polling sources.

146
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:23.800
And none of them would take me because the DSCC told them, if you work for him,

147
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.050
you can't work for any of our candidates.

148
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.440
I couldn't find anyone to even help me.

149
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.550
The only people that would help me were these sort of rogue progressives who

150
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:34.510
were very nice,

151
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:37.090
but also didn't want me to tell anybody they were working for me because they

152
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:39.910
were worried that Schumer and those people would get mad at him.

153
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.200
Schumer basically put a, if you help him and not, when I say Schumer,

154
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:48.970
it was the DSCC. As he see specifically, if you work for him,

155
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.500
you can't do anything for us.

156
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.550
So there was a major democratic party donor here in Kentucky.

157
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:56.730
And one of the biggest national donors who lied,

158
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.900
who thought I was the best candidate and basically went to Schumer and said,

159
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.990
look, you got to give this guy a chance. And only because of that,

160
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:05.100
did he agree to meet with me?

161
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.490
And I've talked specifically about what happened in that meeting.

162
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.060
It was a fine meeting. He brought me up, I spent a couple hours with him.

163
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.980
He agreed to finally like take his hand off the button and let me recruit

164
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:19.380
people. But he told me flat out,

165
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.700
I don't think anybody can beat Mitch McConnell were for Amy McGrath.

166
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.300
Cause we know she can raise money and it will keep Mitch distracted.

167
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.290
That's he told me that flat out and I said, I think you're wrong.

168
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:34.590
Someone can beat him. And he said, well, if you want to try and go for it.

169
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.360
But their whole thing was just to get someone who could raise money.

170
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:42.000
And they knew that Amy McGrath was a money raising machine.

171
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.220
They just gave up on Kentucky before it even started. And it was infuriating.

172
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.740
I ended up not doing it, but I'd have to tell you, Andrew,

173
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:52.440
I almost did it just to, just to prove them wrong, you know,

174
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.930
but Charles is a perfect example,

175
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:58.680
Charles and there's polling private polling that suggests this Charles would

176
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.240
have made this a much closer race,

177
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.300
but Chuck Schumer didn't care about it being a close race.

178
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.300
He cared about the money being raised. And that's the problem.

179
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.310
<v 0>That is very tough to hear because there are so many missed</v>

180
00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:17.630
opportunities, really, uh, Amy's background.

181
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.830
Um,

182
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.000
I mean she obviously is a very impressive personal and a military background.

183
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.920
Then she'd raised a ton of money in an earlier race. Um, so what were those,

184
00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:32.420
the reasons why Chuck looked up or the DSCC looked up and said, okay, um,

185
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.040
we're going to get behind Amy because she'd like,

186
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:38.720
how much did you raise in our previous race?

187
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.300
<v 1>Well, on paper, she's a perfect candidate, military veteran,</v>

188
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.700
very smart, engaging, et cetera. But races are not run on paper.

189
00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:54.320
She raised a lot of money in 2018 in a midterm partially

190
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:57.290
because she put out one of the best television commercials you'll ever see,

191
00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:00.890
which was her first commercial, which went viral and she raised a ton of money,

192
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.560
but I think this is important. She lost.

193
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.100
And she lost when the polls said that she was going to win,

194
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.960
she way underperformed expectations, but it was like nobody even cared.

195
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.500
They just sort of moved past that and said, well, you know,

196
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.940
still she's the best candidate.

197
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.410
I think what you get is when you have people from Washington DC

198
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.460
saying what they believe people in Kentucky will like,

199
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.470
they're going to screw it up. I mean, what do they know?

200
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.160
They're not in Kentucky. If you had been here in 2018.

201
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.640
And I say this with no offense to Amy McGrath, who I think is, you know,

202
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.630
a good person and, and, and uh, military hero.

203
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.240
But if you had been here in 2018,

204
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.850
you would know that she could not beat Mitch McConnell.

205
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.120
And that putting her in the race in Kentucky was a terrible mistake.

206
00:11:47.121 --> 00:11:48.140
You would just know that,

207
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.000
but I don't think anybody in Kentucky was ever even consulted the question

208
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.970
just who did, who did Chuck Schumer want? And when Chuck Schumer wanted them,

209
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.690
they win.

210
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.260
And I think there are other examples around the country that it is very

211
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:06.580
difficult in a primary to beat the establishment pick. So,

212
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:10.540
and then the field gets weighted because she raised so much money.

213
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:15.130
She raised like $8 million her first two weeks in the campaign, Andrew,

214
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.450
how am I supposed to compete in a primary against somebody has $8 million when

215
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.540
we're, and then when they tell big donors, don't give him money.

216
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.360
Where am I supposed to get any money? No, Charles Booker,

217
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:28.570
if it was not for the black lives matter protest,

218
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.480
he may have never even gotten sort of noticed,

219
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.590
but he did because he was such a great leader during that time period.

220
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.510
But before that, she just had so much money. It was impossible.

221
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:44.650
And that was all done by the national party. And this is a missed opportunity.

222
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.690
I'm not gonna lie. It would have been hard to beat.

223
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.070
Mitch McConnell would not have been easy.

224
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:52.030
You would have had to run a perfect race, especially with Trump on the ballot.

225
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.710
If he wasn't on the ballot, it's different.

226
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.560
<v 0>But it was possible. Thank you for listening in.</v>
