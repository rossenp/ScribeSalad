00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>So Michael, let's start with you and mayors for a guaranteed income.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.680
How the heck did this come about? I know a little bit of the backstory, um,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.370
but we'd love to hear from you exactly how you got started.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.320
<v 1>And a lot of it came as you, partly from watching. Just how,</v>

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.870
when you made the decision to run for president,

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.080
primarily on this idea of a guaranteed or a universal basic income,

7
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:25.850
how much momentum from the eyes, the idea attractive and seeing how.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.150
<v 0>You're giving me too much credit, Michael, you giving me too much credit.</v>

9
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.210
You were on this stuff before I arrived on the scene.

10
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.340
<v 1>Um, but it was, it, it, it, it made it very clear how it was a national.</v>

11
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:41.930
It was in the nation was more ready for it than than many people anticipated.

12
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.510
Um, so then during the COVID-19,

13
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:47.930
and sort of seeing how for the folks in the Stockton pilot,

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.750
which we launched in February, 2019,

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.300
so many of them were persisting because of this $500 that they were

16
00:00:56.301 --> 00:01:00.830
lucky to get and how it allowed one lady who was COVID positive to take two

17
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.580
weeks off of work that allowed another person who didn't get access to the other

18
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.570
planet benefits,

19
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.020
a stable source of income for three months while they wait to get onto

20
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.020
employment roles. And then the George Floyd protests,

21
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.350
which we know it's not just about police brutality,

22
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:18.380
but about the vines of poverty. The vines of lack of opportunity,

23
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.440
I think really had me go back to Dr. King,

24
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:24.560
who was talking about the guarantee come during a similar time.

25
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:29.390
This nation's history when there was 253 riots across the nation of people who

26
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.370
are protesting and saying enough is enough.

27
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.780
<v 0>Michael and I were on a panel. What was it two years ago now, I guess the,</v>

28
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.850
your trial was just getting started three years ago.

29
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.830
<v 1>Three. It was 2017. No, it was October, 2017.</v>

30
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.920
<v 0>I guess. I believe you, man. Time has flown. Uh,</v>

31
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:49.580
so we're in a panel about basic income. And then you said to me,

32
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:51.770
after the panel, you said, Andrew, you can say,

33
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.450
I could never get away with saying,

34
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.470
and I really took that to heart.

35
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.170
Michael is one of the things that came through to meet her.

36
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.180
And the campaign was that like,

37
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:05.330
we each have a message and unfortunately,

38
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.170
or fortunately like the message and the messenger really get tied up together,

39
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.720
uh, today in America, you know, it's like,

40
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.900
like we could all be saying the same thing and it would be interpreted very,

41
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:18.470
very differently based upon who we are.

42
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.790
