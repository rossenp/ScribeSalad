1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>Election night is, uh, is about the presidential race first and foremost.</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.930
Um, but now that I have been endorsing all of these down-ballot candidates,

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.730
some of whom are hardcore gang gang, some of whom are for cash relief. Um,

4
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.220
there's virtually no one on the list. That's not one of those two things.

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.140
Like if, if you're, uh, really, I mean, we endorsed you,

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.190
you're normally for cash relief. Uh,

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.390
so I'm going to be very,

8
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:32.040
very intent on seeing what happens to a lot of these candidates.

9
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.620
Particularly a lot of the, um,

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.840
challengers to incumbents beating an incumbent member of Congress is so

11
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.120
hard under ordinary circumstances.

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.360
It's one reason why you notice anytime it does happen because it just never

13
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.410
happens. Um, but I think there's going to be a time for it to happen.

14
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.440
It's going to be this time. So for context,

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.210
the historical reelection rate for an incumbent member of Congress is 94%

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.920
that's sky high.

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.220
That's better than the golden state warriors and their record year kind of high,

18
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.840
uh, good analogy. So if, uh,

19
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.470
this time it's going to be lower though, because you have a lot of, um,

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.180
a lot of incumbents who are vulnerable or in a contested race,

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.910
and you were seeing record levels of turnout.

22
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.690
The real challenge if Andrew Yang is correct, uh,

23
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.020
and also our processes hold up, not a given, um,

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.400
and that votes are counted and there's an orderly transfer of power. Uh,

25
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.550
and Joe gets worn in January 21st,

26
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.210
really to me that then the work begins, uh, you know, you need to work, work,

27
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:40.260
work to win this election.

28
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.640
I'm working very hard to try and grow the number of

29
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.390
members of Congress that are for cash relief. And so, you know, like we're,

30
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:49.890
we're working, uh,

31
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.360
but then the real work begins after you're in

32
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.460
power, whether you actually make enough big changes.

33
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.930
So that the problems that got Trump elected, don't just fester and grow.

34
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.250
Uh, and there's been a consistent narrative from a number of people that I find

35
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.760
very, very interesting. And we're going to find out one way or another. Um,

36
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.610
and here's the narrative you all heard it? I think, uh,

37
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.630
that Trump for all of his problems, uh,

38
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.580
is not as competent or fascist as you

39
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:28.050
can imagine, uh, arising from a truly disintegrating,

40
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.080
um, civilization where if we don't solve the problems that got Trump elected,

41
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.580
uh, something else comes out of the same, um,

42
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.120
set of ideas and impulses and people, uh,

43
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.040
and that person could be worse than Trump. That person could be, uh,

44
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.790
competent and malignant as well as narcissistic. Uh, you know,

45
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:53.100
that that person could, um,

46
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.930
really put much more

47
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.550
design into some of the darker tendencies that Trump

48
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.510
represented. Whereas Trump was kind of a bull in a China shop like that.

49
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.390
That was his five and approach. Um,

50
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.430
and I think that's one concern that I find by the way,

51
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:19.660
totally legitimate nature, abhors, a vacuum, and the rest of it, uh, you know,

52
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.060
like does the post-presidency Trump remain Trump,

53
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:26.080
are there like other versions that kind of spin out in various ways? You know,

54
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.400
there's this massive level of energy around, uh,

55
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.420
some of these ideas and conspiracy theories and impulses from the fact that Q

56
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.740
Anon is become an actual political movement, despite just starting out as,

57
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.660
um, internet conspiracy theories. And I mean, that, that's pretty wild, right?

58
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.610
So, uh,

59
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.040
so the challenges are going to begin almost after

60
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.230
election day and you're sworn in, uh, the,

61
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:59.470
the thing that Philip Howard said really stuck with me. He said,

62
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.450
the parties have been playing you lose, I lose you lose.

63
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:06.310
I lose all the time while we have been losing ourselves or like the people have

64
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.144
been losing.

65
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.430
And the temptation for Joe and the Dems is going

66
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:16.090
to be, we won, we beat Trump, everything's back to normal.

67
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.680
We can just do our thing.

68
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.200
And because we're saying and rational and well-intended, um, uh,

69
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:26.280
all should be well. And, uh, you should believe in us. Uh,

70
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:29.800
and a lot of Americans don't believe because, uh,

71
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.180
they just don't think that our government is working for them, uh,

72
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.970
and actually solving the problems they see around them. Um,

73
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.650
the fact that we don't have a stimulus relief bill, by the way, is exhibit, uh,

74
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.720
378 and their list of like, why I don't believe in government,

75
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.560
it's an awfully big exhibit. It's like a bigger exhibit than some of the others.

76
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.390
Uh, so the challenge, uh,

77
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.460
is going to be manifold,

78
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.380
but it's strengthening the connection between government and the reality on the

79
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:06.250
ground for many Americans. Uh, if we don't build up that connection,

80
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.400
we don't build up the trust. The mistrust is just going to grow.

81
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.810
The institutional deterioration is just going to grow. Uh,

82
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.580
and the danger is that we become, uh,

83
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.480
increasingly ungovernable and unable to solve meaningful problems over time.

84
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.040
I think this is the real danger. I think we're going to win this election. Uh,

85
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.550
and then the question is whether we go big enough and whether we rebuild in a

86
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:32.530
way that's robust enough.

87
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.310
<v 1>And I know this, if, and let's say, when we win, um,</v>

88
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.830
there are people like you, people like AOC people,

89
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:44.790
like a lot of the candidates we've endorsed that will not let this

90
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:48.210
administration, and we'll be allies to them as much as we can,

91
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:50.700
but we'll not let them be complacent as if things are normal.

92
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.330
Like you are step one on a long road to recovery is.

93
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.950
<v 0>I want to go through all the humanity forward candidates and what happened with</v>

94
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:02.270
their races. I now am so passionate about so many of these candidates,

95
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.250
I'm going to be pumped when they win and very sad if they don't win.

96
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.640
Cause I feel like they all deserve to win. Some of them have very tough races.

97
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.130
Um, but if you're listening to this and you can help in any of the humanity Ford

98
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.260
races, please check it out,

99
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.250
go to move humanity forward.com who knows it could be the person running in your

100
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:26.870
district. Uh, and then you can go vote for them. Uh, but let's help them win.

101
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.790
That's going to be, to me a massive, uh,

102
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.590
like emotional high or low, what happens with those candidates? Um,

103
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.450
because having been a candidate myself,

104
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.440
I see what they put on the line and if they win some of them,

105
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:45.470
if they win that it's going to be historic. Uh,

106
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.710
cause some of them are awesome candidates and human beings,

107
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.460
but running in districts where no one gave them a shot in the beginning,

108
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.930
but now some of them do have a shot.

109
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.220
<v 1>Yeah. I,</v>

110
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.960
the best thing we can do to broaden what you stand for Andrew is actually

111
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:02.920
empowering the people we've, we've tasked with carrying the torch, you know,

112
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:06.700
we've given up who are carrying the torch, so that's moving forward.

113
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:08.620
You can actually donate to all of them.

114
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.120
Like if you only have five bucks to donate,

115
00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:12.700
you can give a little fraction to all of them, which is, you know,

116
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.070
that'd be pennies, I guess. So please get more than that if you're doing that.

117
00:07:15.071 --> 00:07:18.310
But uh, like you can give, you can see them all. Um,

118
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.350
and they need like Joe Biden, like, um, they're good on money.

119
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.640
I think down the stretch here,

120
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.470
they're good. Like, you know, um,

121
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.480
but so he's smaller Candace really kid and like, you know,

122
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.480
a hundred bucks or whatever you can give actually would go a decent way.

123
00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:37.390
But because they're doing a lot of Facebook ads or flyer printing and get out

124
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:38.590
the vote efforts day of,

125
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.740
and that's that actually carries some weight in some of the smaller towns too.

126
00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:42.250
So.

127
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.140
<v 0>I've, I've donated to our candidates. Uh, it's just so fun. You can't resist.</v>

128
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.620
Um, and then after you donate, there's a magical connection that is forged.

129
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.090
Some of you have that connection with me.

130
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.950
So if you want to root even harder for candidate election night,

131
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.980
just make a donation, 10, 20 bucks to them.

132
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:01.000
And then all of a sudden you'll be like,

133
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:05.230
that's my guy or that's my gal and that's my candidate. Um,

134
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:09.010
so I'd encourage you to do so. It really is magical that connection.

135
00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:13.900
It's one reason why I think those organic campaigns like ours and end up

136
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:18.280
being so much stronger, uh, because you feel like you own it, uh,

137
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.110
you be through your support and like it or not,

138
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.470
uh, that, that includes financial support. Um,

139
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.480
there's something very direct and powerful about it.

140
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.100
<v 1>You know, what's cool, Andrew,</v>

141
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:34.630
that we actually don't talk about enough is that you interview every

142
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:38.170
candidate we endorse or about to endorse, um,

143
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.990
and no offense to Barack Obama. He makes a lot of endorsements.

144
00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:43.000
I highly doubt he's doing that. Um,

145
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.660
like you get to know them personally and there have been times, um,

146
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:49.900
where you're like, I, you know, I don't know if this is, you know, you'll, you,

147
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:52.660
you want to get to know them on a personal level to make sure they, um,

148
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.980
that frankly the yang gang or anyone's donating to them. Um, yeah.

149
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.450
<v 0>I personally interview them and, uh, personally donate to them, uh, if,</v>

150
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.540
if we decide to go forward and I've definitely talked to someone and been like,

151
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:07.710
I dunno if this is the way, or this is the fit, because I'd feel terrible,

152
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.790
endorsing someone, if I didn't have that direct experience with them,

153
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.910
even if it is a half an hour zoom or phone call, uh,

154
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.360
and you can go a long way with a half an hour zoom or phone call and getting

155
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.270
into someone's head and seeing what makes them tick.

156
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.330
And now I love those candidates. I'll tell you, like,

157
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.910
if I had endorsed them and I hadn't had that conversation with them,

158
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:31.530
would I feel as strongly as I do? Heck no, maybe a phony. Yeah,

159
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.750
but now I'm so into it. I'm so into each and every one of them.

160
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.230
They're awesome. I don't want to name names. It's like having, you know,

161
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:42.810
but like Donna, David, Kim,

162
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.330
Kara Eastman in Nebraska in that district,

163
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.930
you're talking about the folks who are at yank speaks last week. Uh, Pam,

164
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.340
Keith Allen Cohn, uh, you know, the list just goes on and on.

165
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:58.230
I love them all Sri, you call it Carney, like Lula psychically. Anyway,

166
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.810
uh, dude do check them out and move humanity forward.com.

167
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.650
Let's help them win.

168
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.880
That's going to be a roller coaster for me on election night because I can

169
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:10.440
already see, some of them are going to win.

170
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:12.420
I'm sure some of them are not going to win because many of them have very

171
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:16.710
challenging races, but I'm going to be like, yes, yes. Oh no.

172
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.820
Oh no. And then I'll be, you know, somebody won't know,

173
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.250
I'll be texting them too. I'll be all like,

174
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.100
so excited or like you did great anyway. Um, yeah. Anyway,

175
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.710
so, uh, election night, it's going to be a huge night.

176
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.210
Let's make it even better. Make sure in boat, you can still make a difference.

177
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.730
You can still donate. You can still volunteer.

178
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:41.910
You can still do all sorts of things. Thank you for listening in.
