WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>Uh, so do you have, uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.320
principles or things that people can keep in mind to try to improve their

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.050
ability to communicate digitally right now? Yeah.

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.910
<v 1>Yeah. I do. This relates a little bit to you. So you said, you know,</v>

5
00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:17.210
I got into presidential race because I'm looking around me and there's a lot of

6
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:20.090
huge problems. And I feel like I should try to fix some of these problems.

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.900
It's an exaggeration to say I got into communications training for the same

8
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:26.960
reason, but it's kind of like that. In other words,

9
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.320
there is a lot of really terrible coaching out there that people get.

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.350
And what I mean by that is not like that. They go take a class somewhere.

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.770
There's a lot of received ideas about how you should be better as a

12
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:39.320
communicator. And it tends to fall into two things.

13
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:43.970
One is something called thought suppression and number two is tremendously

14
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:47.360
reductive coaching. So FOBTs oppression sounds like this.

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.170
Don't be nervous, Andrew, just be yourself. Okay.

16
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:53.840
So that's thought suppression coaching. You're welcome for that, by the way.

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.550
That's great. I know number two is like when you speak,

18
00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:02.630
make sure you speak in the lower third of your voice and make broad commanding

19
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:04.790
gestures to emphasize key points.

20
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.400
<v 0>Where were these instructions? When I needed them? Like,</v>

21
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.390
don't be nervous and speak low and gesture big. it.

22
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.270
I could have been president if you had just clued me in.

23
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.860
<v 1>Writing it, that kind of feedback happens at the highest levels too.</v>

24
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.030
It absolutely does.

25
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.930
And it's part of why you see people making the same gesture over and over again,

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.680
or speaking in this very reductive manner all the time to try to emphasize key

27
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:32.960
points, no matter what they're talking about.

28
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.470
So people get this really reductive coaching and the thoughts oppression is even

29
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:39.500
worse actually, because the thoughts of prejudice, like just as I told you,

30
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.990
don't be nervous. As soon as I say that your brain goes right to thoughts,

31
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.900
suppression, which is like, don't do this thing,

32
00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:48.380
your brains obligated to look at the thing, because it's looking at that thing.

33
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:52.670
Now it's thinking about that thing and how bad you are at not doing that thing.

34
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.160
And of course, people get kind of paralyzed in that.

35
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.810
So my goal is always to try to get them out of thought suppression and reductive

36
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:01.580
coaching and try to unlock what they do really,

37
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:04.550
really well when they are back to that point. Other focused,

38
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:08.660
as opposed to totally self-focused people think about like their presentation or

39
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.570
their presence as being something is all about them.

40
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.150
And so they think like when I'm comfortable, I come across well.

41
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.830
And when I'm uncomfortable, I don't.

42
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.490
And the funny thing is that for almost everyone,

43
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.630
you come across the best when you're actually trying to communicate something to

44
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:27.530
someone else, I mean, legitimately other focused. So as an example,

45
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:30.350
like let's say a friend comes to you and the friend is in a crisis and you start

46
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:33.650
talking to the friend and you hear what's happening to them.

47
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:37.490
I promise you like right away, your eye contact improves right away.

48
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.150
You begin to speak in very technical language. If that's needed or very,

49
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:44.990
very colloquial and casual language, if that's needed right away,

50
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.140
you slow down your rate of speech. If the person's having a hard time,

51
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:50.720
digesting what you're sharing, you do all that automatically.

52
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.870
And you never think about like my presentation skills.

53
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:57.350
You just do it because you're using all of yourself to try to reach the other

54
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:02.260
person. Now what happens this format is that, I mean, for a bunch of reasons,

55
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.370
one of which is you have a little floating box of your video, right? That,

56
00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:08.080
that you're staring at part of the time of like, what are my hands doing?

57
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:09.280
What is my face doing?

58
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.780
It's very hard not to feel self conscious the entire time and be thinking about

59
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.070
my communication skills.

60
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.490
But what you want to do is unlock what people do when they're actually very

61
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.180
focused on the other person. And the strange thing is right now,

62
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.160
even as weird as that camera feels,

63
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.320
this is the vehicle that people have to reach. Everybody, friends, family,

64
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.810
and employer, anyone. This is the vehicle we have.

65
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.190
So helping people unlock that idea of other focus, even when they can't help,

66
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:38.830
but be a little bit self-focus is really important.

67
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.021
<v 0>Oh,</v>

68
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:44.970
so it's caring about what the other person is getting as opposed to what you

69
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:47.370
are doing at any moment in time.

70
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.420
So we have a couple of things that are out there in the world that are not great

71
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.600
piece of advice for folks. So what's the goods.

72
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.830
<v 1>So like if you're asking about principals, a couple of things, immediately, one,</v>

73
00:03:58.831 --> 00:03:59.910
you alluded to this,

74
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:04.650
which is that people totally underestimate how deeply physical spoken

75
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:08.490
communications are. So people think like if I've done my homework,

76
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:11.250
if I've prepared my PowerPoint slides, if I've prepped for the interview,

77
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.400
if I've gone over the questions I might get asked, I'm going to do great.

78
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:16.500
And it's not true. I mean, think about how many,

79
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:18.930
like scientists or subject matter experts there are,

80
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.480
who are phenomenal in terms of what they know,

81
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:24.480
but they can't actually communicate it very well at all.

82
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.290
So the point is that when you put words into language,

83
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.790
this remarkable coordination happens where your diaphragm drops down your lungs,

84
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:36.750
fill with air, that air then flows over your vocal chords. They vibrate.

85
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.880
They actually move in space. They make some sound,

86
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.360
the sound amplifies throughout your whole body and then your mouth and your

87
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:43.830
tongue and your lips and your throat, your jaw,

88
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.120
they all work together to shape that raw sound into words that can be

89
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.040
understood. So it's much,

90
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:54.060
much closer to a sport than it is any kind of mental exercise.

91
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:56.400
It's part of the reason why we would always warm up.

92
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.180
We put so much focus on the campaign of like getting yourself physically and

93
00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:01.740
vocally prime to communicate.

94
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.430
So the biggest principle that people mess up all the time is they think it's all

95
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:06.540
about what's up here.

96
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.040
And so much of it has to do with what's happening down here and you can actually

97
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:11.874
prepare that.

98
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.810
And the reason that's so liberating is because that you can actually control

99
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.660
you. Can't control what question you're going to get from the interviewer.

100
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.523
You can't,

101
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.880
but you can control how you've prepared yourself physically and vocally to take

102
00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:25.920
that question and hopefully hit out of the park.

103
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.950
<v 0>So what would those preparation activities look like for someone</v>

104
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:33.060
pre job interview?

105
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.350
<v 1>Yeah. So that's another big thing to apply it to, which is this.</v>

106
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.070
People are good at something whoever's listening to this right now.

107
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.200
You're good at something you're an expert in something.

108
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.880
And oftentimes there's some sort of a ritual or regimen you go through with that

109
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:51.930
thing that helps you do that thing. Well, so for instance, if you're an athlete,

110
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.140
warm-up physically like an athlete before you begin speaking,

111
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:58.100
if you're a dancer, same thing, if a same thing,

112
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.990
but even if you like to do something much more cerebral, like board games,

113
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.880
there are still principles that can be applied to speaking that apply one to one

114
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.210
from that sort of discipline. So one thing I often tell people is like,

115
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.370
choose something. You're already very expert in,

116
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.210
figure out what the principles are of that and apply it to communication.

117
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.470
That's kind of vague, but I can get much more specific if you want, please.

118
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.513
Yeah, sure.

119
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.320
<v 0>I'm imagining I'm a person, I'm a viewer. And let's say,</v>

120
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:30.100
I'm listening to this and I have a job interview tomorrow. And so then I'm like,

121
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:32.950
okay, now, thanks to Michael.

122
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:36.490
Like I'm going to approach this like a little bit more of a physical activity.

123
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.980
Um, and then instead of cramming notes into my head, right before the interview,

124
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:43.870
I'm going to do this instead.

125
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.311
<v 1>Well,</v>

126
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:49.420
what you would do this instead is you would get physically and vocally warmed

127
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:52.630
up. You can do tongue twisters or you can do stretches.

128
00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:54.880
You can get your body and your breath ready to go.

129
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.910
There's a bunch of stuff we can share with your viewers and listeners,

130
00:06:57.911 --> 00:06:58.451
if you want to,

131
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.930
in terms of resources and access and stuff like that we can get to.

132
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.250
But that's the principle of the idea then as opposed to thinking about

133
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:07.240
everything on the page,

134
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.710
grab a cell phone and talk into it and give yourself rhetorical questions.

135
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.830
If I were to get asked this question, what would I say?

136
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.350
And start recording it if you want to, if you want to listen back,

137
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.370
if you don't want to,

138
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.810
even the practice of just saying the stuff out loud helps actually get your body

139
00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:26.470
physically ready to go and begins to take those talking points from a bunch of

140
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:30.370
stuff in your head and actually puts it into the real world by speaking it out

141
00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:33.790
loud. So one warm up to, yeah, go ahead.

142
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.510
<v 0>No, no, no, you, you, you go ahead. You're just warming up actually.</v>

143
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.050
<v 1>Yeah. Warm up actually. Ah, but um,</v>

144
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.190
warm up practice actually saying this stuff out loud and do it so that you're

145
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.960
priming yourself with a question.

146
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.740
Meaning if I were to put this in the form of a story, it might be,

147
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.220
or if I get this question and what I might say is,

148
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.040
so you're actually practicing saying things out loud.

149
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.340
<v 0>So you know, those TV characters where before the big interview,</v>

150
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:02.260
they always are practicing,

151
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.710
talking into a mirror to like pump themselves up before they go to the

152
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.040
interviews. You're saying that actually is wise. Like it,

153
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:14.020
it's not just like a on TV that you see characters doing that that's actually a

154
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:15.100
good idea. Yeah.

155
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.960
<v 1>Yeah. Well, with a caveat,</v>

156
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.500
sometimes being in the mirror makes people a bit more self-conscious.

157
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.200
So you may want to have that visual feedback. You may not,

158
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.850
but putting sound into words is absolutely essential. I mean,

159
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:29.890
a different way to look at the same thing is like,

160
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.150
is your 10:30 AM phone call better than your 9:00 AM phone call?

161
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.330
And for a lot of people, the answer is, yeah,

162
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.350
what they've done is they use the interview that was at nine and nine,

163
00:08:41.351 --> 00:08:45.520
15 and nine 30 and 10:00 AM as warmups to get to the 10 30.

164
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.560
So my point is start early.

165
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.560
It put the warm up by yourself early in the day before that.

166
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.190
And then actually your body will be physically and vocally primed and ready to

167
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:56.880
go to communicate. Wow.

168
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.490
<v 0>That makes a world of sense to just about everyone listening to this,</v>

169
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.940
just try and make every call, your 10 30 calls so to speak.

170
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.350
<v 1>Yeah, but by getting physically and vocally primed.</v>

171
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.850
<v 0>By doing an hour and a half of something at a time, so you're not cold.</v>

172
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.370
<v 1>Well, you know, it's cool though. You don't need an hour and a half,</v>

173
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.660
like really five minutes will do the trick. 10 minutes is even better.

174
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.920
And there's time and warmups and tongue twisters and exercises you can do.

175
00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:25.130
And of course we'll make that available to anybody on this and listen to you,

176
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:26.540
but you can also just Google stuff,

177
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.650
but we have a whole series of video warmups that we give to clients that can

178
00:09:30.651 --> 00:09:33.740
follow along because it is a little bit different than a sport.

179
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.520
And that when you're speaking, it's all about this channel right here.

180
00:09:37.521 --> 00:09:41.420
So your mouth, your lungs, your windpipe here, and your torso. Now,

181
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:42.800
if you're going to play baseball, of course,

182
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:44.930
it's a lot about your risks and things like that.

183
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.940
Communication is a little bit different that way.

184
00:09:46.941 --> 00:09:51.080
So there are specialized warmups that you can do that are about how you walk and

185
00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:51.914
talk.

186
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.850
<v 0>I love the mind body connection aspect.</v>

187
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.380
<v 1>Yeah. You know, that's like,</v>

188
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:01.820
I think a bit of an unexplored frontier with this whole thing, which is,

189
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.520
there's this really powerful thing that unlocks when you get people

190
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:08.720
communicating better is they feel better and it's not just because they feel

191
00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:12.200
better because they have said smart stuff when you're communicating well,

192
00:10:12.201 --> 00:10:13.130
in order to do that,

193
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.090
you actually have to stand up a little bit more to have room for your diaphragm

194
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:18.890
to drop down and your lungs to fill with air.

195
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.730
And you actually have to open your mouth a bit more for the sound to come out

196
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.170
and you actually have to use your body in a more dynamic way.

197
00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:29.330
So on a really granular level,

198
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.620
you're actually using yourself more like an athlete and it begins to unlock

199
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.500
actually feeling better. You have to breathe more.

200
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.910
That oxygen actually helps your life.

201
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:42.110
So people are so focused right now on how sitting is bad and it is sitting as

202
00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:44.540
much as we do for, you know, remote existence right now.

203
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.050
<v 0>Well, is that what you standing? Is that something you'd recommend for folks?</v>

204
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.550
<v 1>Yeah. Well, two things. So I have a stool too,</v>

205
00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:53.870
that I can sit on at times,

206
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.160
because it's not realistic to think that you can stand for eight hours a day,

207
00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:00.980
you know, and you want to be able to go back and forth, but yeah,

208
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.120
people should stand for a significant amount of time during the day they should,

209
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.013
if they can.

210
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.920
<v 0>So if someone has, let's call it a 20 minute job interview sitting or standing.</v>

211
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.470
<v 1>Um, I would say standing.</v>

212
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.760
<v 0>Well, that's a very, very concrete piece of advice.</v>

213
00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:20.630
And I have to say that I'm imagining you being interviewed. Uh,

214
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.830
and it seems like you would be more effective standing because you seem more

215
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:29.420
comfortable and energetic. I know when I was a candidate,

216
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.460
if I had a choice between sitting or standing,

217
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:34.190
I always stood because you were just more energetic.

218
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.530
So you described that you have your own space, uh, and it's obviously, I mean,

219
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:41.180
in your case, you're doing this all day long.

220
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.920
How do you create a good first impression digitally in terms of having a

221
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:48.800
backdrop that seems professional without going overboard?

222
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.000
<v 1>Sure. Well, people have probably at this point heard a bunch of the basic,</v>

223
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.410
you want a light source from the front, so your face can be seen.

224
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.470
You want to present background. So you have a bit of a depth of field.

225
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.850
Mine is actually probably busier than you want for an interview or things like

226
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:04.150
that.

227
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.710
I do it again because I'm trying to keep folks awake and engaged and they're

228
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:11.470
like, I referenced things like Fox and socks.

229
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:13.210
If I want them to do tongue twist or something.

230
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.610
<v 0>It has changed my life. Uh, I don't know if you have one of these,</v>

231
00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:22.050
I'll see if I can show everybody. Um, it's one of these circle lights,

232
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.460
uh, uh, that know, like those things. Yeah.

233
00:12:26.461 --> 00:12:28.710
Like I'll show you all what it looks like. I mean, you can,

234
00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:32.430
it looks like a UFO now. Um, but right. Uh,

235
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.060
like this thing is definitely changed everything for me in terms of zooming

236
00:12:36.061 --> 00:12:41.010
because you stick it there and then there's always a light on your face. Uh,

237
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:45.810
I think it might've cost, I don't know. 30 bucks.

238
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.800
40 bucks.

239
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.620
<v 1>Yeah. And then you want to have the camera roughly at eye level,</v>

240
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:51.750
which you're doing a great job by the way right now,

241
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.480
now that sounds like a few things to remember, right? You're like, huh.

242
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.600
Three things. Okay. What should I do? Exactly. It's really simple.

243
00:12:57.601 --> 00:13:01.290
Just think of it this way. If you were setting a friend up for a good photo,

244
00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:03.240
when you're traveling, you would do the same things.

245
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.790
You would not put the sun like right behind their head.

246
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.960
You would not make the background, the least attractive part of the scenery.

247
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.960
And you would also not shoot them from an unflattering angle,

248
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:14.790
like up their nose or something like that.

249
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.190
So just to the same exact three principles,

250
00:13:17.191 --> 00:13:20.310
when you're setting yourself up visually for success,

251
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.670
we should talk about what to do with interruptions on zoom.

252
00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:24.840
Let's do that for a second.

253
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.320
<v 0>We've all had those zoom interruptions. So what are the best practices?</v>

254
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.280
<v 1>Oftentimes the strongest thing you can do when things go wrong,</v>

255
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.460
because they will, they're going to go wrong. It's not like an, if it's a win,

256
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.200
the strongest thing you can do is actually be transparent in some way. And so,

257
00:13:40.201 --> 00:13:42.780
because people get interrupted, there's dogs, there's pets,

258
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:46.290
there's tech challenges. People can actually embrace that.

259
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.640
And especially if you're talking about hiring someone that is going to

260
00:13:50.641 --> 00:13:55.140
demonstrate a level of in the moment, resiliency in the mono moment,

261
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:59.160
calm spontaneity. That is actually a good thing.

262
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.790
So when mistakes happen, people can actually just be transparent about it.

263
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.980
<v 0>No, I was trying to make a Marco Rubio joke like that out, whatever it is.</v>

264
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.980
<v 1>But you know, it's funny though. So just now you're taking a drink of water.</v>

265
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.690
That's transparent. Right?

266
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.330
You trying to hide the fact that you're taking a drink of water,

267
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.080
not so transparent. So that's a perfect example of what we're talking about.

268
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.130
<v 0>Certainly if you do get interrupted during an interview,</v>

269
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.450
as long as you seem confident and have the right spirit, uh, then people will,

270
00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:31.980
I think, completely accepted.

271
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:37.080
Like I've had my kids running all sorts of times and then sometimes

272
00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:38.090
we'd be like, Oh, that's cute.

273
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.270
<v 1>Yeah. I teach, uh, teach three apps for this. It's a little bit like, you know,</v>

274
00:14:42.271 --> 00:14:45.390
sticky because it's alliterative, but people remember stuff.

275
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.130
Cause it's literative so it helps people out.

276
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.740
So we teach the idea of fake it or feature it or fix it. And so fake,

277
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:56.660
it means like if the kid runs in, but no one knows if the kid's like right here,

278
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:59.780
like, hi daddy. And there's just doing that thing. You don't have to say like,

279
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.930
Hey, I call my kids standing right here. You can just fake it. Great.

280
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.770
But if the kid steals the attention of the whole thing,

281
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:10.970
you can either feature it or fix it and feature. It means just what you did.

282
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:12.830
Like man, my kids here say hello.

283
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.380
<v 2>So I feel like people will be on their way based upon these principles</v>

284
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:22.000
alone. Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation.
