WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>You and I have been, uh, through a lot together,</v>

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.650
I guess we could use this as an opportunity for us, uh,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.990
collegial therapy about, uh,

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.760
the presidential campaign and then our time afterwards.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.050
Uh, but you and I bonded over the fact that it's,

6
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:22.650
it seems like the media was more interested in presenting some

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.720
figment of their imagination

8
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.290
than the actual individuals that, that we were. Um,

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.450
and certainly I felt like that was true in your case where you had this breakout

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.730
debate performance on one of the first two debates and you were one of those

11
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.520
Google people for everyone, uh,

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.730
everyone was really excited about you and they saw what I'd seen already,

13
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.690
which is that you were speaking the truth and connecting with folks in a really

14
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:55.140
important way. And then it was almost like, uh,

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.570
like this strange, uh,

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.950
shark attack where it seemed like everywhere you looked there was some kind of

17
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:04.620
negative media treatment. Like it's like, Oh no, no,

18
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.430
like you can't be excited about this person. Uh, and that,

19
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:11.850
that was the way it seemed from my perspective.

20
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.260
But certainly from your perspective, I'm sure it was much more, uh, visceral.

21
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.470
<v 1>Well, it didn't just seem that way. It was that way. Clearly someone said,</v>

22
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:24.440
get that woman off the stage. That was very clear.

23
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.860
And I saw it in some of their eyes backstage after the debate,

24
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.100
when we were in the spin room, I saw some people whose eyes said, lady,

25
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:32.810
you're dead. You will not be coming back,

26
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.670
but I underestimated the viciousness, the,

27
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.200
the strategy, the obvious talking points. She's dangerous. She's crazy.

28
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.120
She's she's uh,

29
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.010
anti-science she's anti-vax she's you think I was well, whatever.

30
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.300
And so, yeah, it came, it was ubiquitously wasn't it?

31
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.650
That I had told eight patients not to take their medicine,

32
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:59.360
which was particularly ridiculous,

33
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:03.140
given my history with aid patients and the fact that at that time there was no

34
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:08.060
medicine. I mean, the most vile and vicious things actually. Um,

35
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.460
and I thought in terms of you,

36
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.760
it was particularly interesting because I thought that the, the massage,

37
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.840
Annie was very clear. You did things Andrew that I thought were adorable,

38
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.960
like when you put whipped cream in your volunteers mouth,

39
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:24.680
and when you crowd surfed and you know, all that, if I had done those things,

40
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.880
so yeah, it was, uh, quite something.

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.921
<v 0>Well,</v>

42
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:35.600
certainly you can't live in America and not know that gender plays an enormous

43
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.660
role, uh, in treatment of really anyone,

44
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.070
but my political and presidential candidates at a much higher level. Um,

45
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.010
and I agree with you that some of the things that happened on my campaign would

46
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:53.510
have seemed very, very different, uh, if, if it had come from another candidate.

47
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.170
<v 1>And also you didn't have any previous political experience,</v>

48
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.830
so why did they make that such a big deal in my case, but not in yours so.

49
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.920
<v 0>Well, they mean they made it a big deal to buy the case too.</v>

50
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.480
<v 1>Not the same way. You know, it's not the same way you were.</v>

51
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.340
<v 0>No. Well, I mean, the,</v>

52
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.380
the media treatment of the two of us was different for sure. Uh,

53
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.870
and like the,

54
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.940
the caricature as they painted were different and that it was painful for me

55
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.940
watching what people were writing about you,

56
00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:31.020
given that you and I had connected. So like I knew you for months before these,

57
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.140
this, these debates occurred. Uh, and,

58
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:37.410
and if you speak to someone individually,

59
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.360
you can tell that they're thoughtful patriotic, uh,

60
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.220
sincere. Uh, and then when you see various things being written about them,

61
00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:50.310
you're like, well, where the heck did that come from? And I agree with you,

62
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:53.850
like, I'd underestimated the, uh,

63
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.550
the capacity of the media to write a story that suited

64
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:02.790
their needs rather than something that they were actually interacting with in,

65
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:03.624
in real life.

66
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.570
<v 1>Yeah. And the lack of journalistic ethics,</v>

67
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.570
the using anonymous tweets as a source, a lie,

68
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.970
a false narrative is repeated,

69
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:15.480
and then they just repeated again and repeated again. Um,

70
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.160
the interesting thing,

71
00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:20.850
and the sad thing for me was that when I actually spoke to audiences,

72
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.650
people knew who I was,

73
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.820
but what that smear did was convinced so many people that they didn't want to

74
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:28.530
come hear me. Um,

75
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.970
but I don't leave the experience. Uh,

76
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.200
just with those memories.

77
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:39.120
I leave the experience with very inspiring and motivating and,

78
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.890
um, encouraging and loving memories. Because as you know,

79
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.170
because you were there doing the same thing,

80
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.820
the people that we were talking to the voters were fantastic.

81
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.050
Now there's the voters. And then there's the political media industrial complex.

82
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.730
Uh, you fared better by the media, uh, political, uh,

83
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.170
machine than I did,

84
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.580
but we had the same experience of the voters and it was wonderful.

85
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.280
And, um, that, that gap between those two,

86
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.740
uh, I find tragic because what you represented, what I represented,

87
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:20.580
what Bernie represented in our own different ways was a different conversation

88
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.660
and no conversation, one that did not adhere to the same old,

89
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:28.320
same old formulations. And what I experienced as do you did too,

90
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.830
is that the people are ready for that. The problem is not with the decency,

91
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.840
the dignity, or even the regenerative interest of the American people. Um,

92
00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:40.140
and that's where our democracy is broken. And I hope, uh,

93
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.720
as the months and years unfold,

94
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.630
that that rupture can be healed.

95
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.930
<v 0>Wherever I went. People loved you. And I had the same experience that you did,</v>

96
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:56.640
where when you have conversations with actual voters or

97
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.050
families, just trying to, to improve their lives,

98
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.420
it was essentially a completely different conversation than what was being had,

99
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.890
uh, in the media.

100
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.780
And that connection was for me profound.

101
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:15.290
I think you had one experience having that connection with people then,

102
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.450
because you've been, um,

103
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.970
a spiritual leader for so long. Did you watch the,

104
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.430
I watched both the DNC and the RNC.

105
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.960
<v 1>I thought you were great by the way, I thought you were wonderful. Um, yeah,</v>

106
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.990
so I watched all of the democratic and all of the Republican.

107
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.940
<v 0>Me too. And, uh, you know, like it, it was,</v>

108
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.260
it was a fascinating parallel universe.

109
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.820
Like I felt myself dropped into a really it, to some extent, both of them,

110
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:50.770
honestly. Um, but, uh, but I recognized more of one than the other, uh,

111
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.060
and the, and, uh, the RNC I joked, uh, that it,

112
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.020
it felt like, uh, like the movie Starship troopers to me,

113
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:00.040
I don't know if you remember that movie.

114
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.560
<v 1>And I saw your tweet about it and I looked it up. Yeah. I.</v>

115
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.350
<v 0>It, a satire, but authoritarianism is what the movie was.</v>

116
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.550
<v 1>Well, I didn't think it was satire at all. It was the very real thing.</v>

117
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.540
I thought that the Republican convention was evil genius.

118
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.180
I thought it was brilliant in its Maleficent,

119
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.410
maleficence, Maleficent. Yeah. It was malevolent in,

120
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.350
in a brilliant way. Um, I,

121
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.110
the way they took genuine moments,

122
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.200
genuinely human authenticity,

123
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.970
and they wrapped it around big lies. Uh,

124
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.010
I thought it was brilliant in a very evil way.

125
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.400
And also the thing that I felt was the saddest.

126
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.310
And as someone who wants Joe Biden to win very badly,

127
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.020
they prosecuted a case against Joe Biden.

128
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.580
Why didn't the democratic convention prosecute a case against Donald Trump,

129
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.170
if ever there was a prosecutable criminal in the white house, here it is.

130
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.350
They didn't prosecute a case. Kamala Harris is a famous prosecutor.

131
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.030
Why don't you prosecute a case? And the other thing is the Republican party,

132
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.500
even though the vast majority of it was lies, bragged about policies.

133
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.190
We did this most of the time, it was a lie. We're going to do that.

134
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.070
Most of the time, it's probably a lie, the democratic convention,

135
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.200
where was the policy?

136
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.970
So I hope that something was learned, uh,

137
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.560
by the strategists in the, uh, Biden campaign.

138
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.850
And I hope they come out swinging, uh, much harder, uh,

139
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.260
in the weeks that we have left.

140
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.570
<v 0>What you say about the RNC.</v>

141
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.950
It's true that they would take real human stories,

142
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.140
human sentiment, individuals,

143
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.440
and then they would wrap them in this other set of ideas or values or

144
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.520
propositions. Uh, and you would see it and the wild thing,

145
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:05.580
even for me where I'd be like, well, that part of it,

146
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.150
I appreciate and value and agree with,

147
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.970
but they've taken it someplace else that, you know,

148
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.700
I don't agree with or appreciate or value at all.

149
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.150
And that was like a repetitive theme, but you're right. It was very well done.

150
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.390
<v 1>It was so they will take some story that is so touching</v>

151
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.060
and so real that if you didn't know the facts,

152
00:09:26.061 --> 00:09:29.150
if you didn't know the larger context, you think, wow, these people really care.

153
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.170
It was like a purse thief saying, look over there, look over there.

154
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.290
So they had you look over here so that you weren't looking over there,

155
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.440
where at what was really happening and that had to do with race.

156
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:44.030
It had to do with the economy it had to do with everything. Um,

157
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.480
they're playing a very tough game. Uh,

158
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.410
one of the things I said repeatedly on the campaign trail was that the only way

159
00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:55.280
to beat outrageous lies is with some outrageous truth.

160
00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.680
And I hope we're going to see some more hard hitting outrageous truths. Um,

161
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.310
over the next few weeks for the Democrats now on the campaign trail,

162
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.990
there were to be honest,

163
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.440
only three of us really laying down some outrageous jurors.

164
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:12.140
And that was you and me and Bernie and Tulsi to some extent.

165
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.570
So I hope a more radical level of
