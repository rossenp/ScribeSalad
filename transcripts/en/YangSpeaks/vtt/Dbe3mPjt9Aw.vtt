1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>So I have to, to comment on your t-shirt. I think it says immigrants feed,</v>

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.950
uh, America, which I could not agree more with. Uh,

3
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:12.150
and you have such an incredible personal narrative yourself. Uh,

4
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:17.130
you came to this country with next to nothing. Uh, you worked in a restaurant.

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.830
I know you've been back and forth to Spain and the U S but you,

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.460
your work, uh,

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.440
just kept on drawing more and more fans and support and, uh,

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.990
everywhere you went, people, um, wanted to,

9
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:36.540
to taste your food, really like, you know, is so much of it. Uh,

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.340
and I feel like your immigrant story is the story that so many

11
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.980
people came to this country to, uh,

12
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.640
have a chance at themselves just to try and create a better life for themselves

13
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:52.560
and their families. Uh, and I, you know, I'm the son of immigrants, myself, uh,

14
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.640
and you know, I know you've had your run-ins with, uh, our current president,

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.690
hopefully outgoing president over the fact that you were supposed to have a

16
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.740
restaurant in one of his establishment. And then you said, you know what?

17
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:08.400
I don't think I want to have a restaurant in this establishment and, uh,

18
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.950
and ended up, um, like, uh,

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.190
on the other side of the president there,

20
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.770
which I commended your,

21
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.090
or like I like many Americans thought that you were awfully, uh,

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.390
principled and courageous to make that stand. Um,

23
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.890
but I'm sure there were some negative effects, uh, uh,

24
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.580
as well that you had to deal with. Well.

25
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.900
<v 1>Let me tell you, in my end of the day, I wake up and,</v>

26
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.970
uh,

27
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.950
the president of United States is suing my company and myself personally.

28
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.380
And actually, because I was the right thing to do, I saw him back. Uh,

29
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.880
how many times do you have a president of the United States that is in a suit

30
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:54.170
with a citizen? I think it's the first. Um,

31
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.730
but they needed, because I,

32
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.350
I sincerely believe that that his comments on

33
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.560
Mexicans were you, uh,

34
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.570
not the right thing to be listening from a leader. Um,

35
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.330
um, and that the right thing to do was to stand up. Um,

36
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.090
many people told me you knew he will be compressed.

37
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.360
And will you do the same as a hundred times over? Yes.

38
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.870
I remember speaking with him, uh,

39
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.770
in the early days of his comments and he told me, don't worry if it's,

40
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:32.060
everything will be fine, Jose, we are winning. We're winning. Say,

41
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.170
Mr. Trump, I'm trying to open a restaurant.

42
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
I'm not running in your ticket. Uh, I'm not supporting your ticket.

43
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.530
I only want to have a successful restaurant. And I believe that we, the people,

44
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.970
uh, means that we should be respecting each other. I, it doesn't seem,

45
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.610
you're a person that respect others,

46
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.680
and I hope that you will change. I'll rephrase, uh, your comments.

47
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.940
I thought he was going to do.

48
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.430
I was so naive that I thought that I cook like me an immigrant,

49
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.140
like me could make a person again,

50
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.610
maybe to sound apologetic. I don't know.

51
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.150
<v 0>I think that was naive at all. Jose. I like, like,</v>

52
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.860
it was quite reasonable of you to think that.

53
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.320
<v 1>He doubled down two weeks later and he is a mom. And, uh, so for me,</v>

54
00:03:19.321 --> 00:03:22.860
obviously you mentioned about my shirt, immigrants, immigration reform,

55
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.210
listen as an immigrant and as a Spanish American,

56
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.460
I'm very thankful about the amazing opportunity I gain by being

57
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:36.870
invited to join this country and by becoming American,

58
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.010
uh, you'll gain a lot of, um, uh,

59
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.570
I love things that these new country of ours gives us, but we've,

60
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.650
we've, we've becoming American.

61
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.260
Also you gain responsibilities to be a good citizen,

62
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.270
to give back to respect others and to give back as much as we received

63
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:59.790
from the country that welcomed us. Um,

64
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.350
but also we need to be aware of the big lie that we have on immigration

65
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:07.140
reform that we need to be also pragmatic.

66
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.950
We had chances with the democratic party that we didn't take on

67
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.250
on is, uh, everybody needs to be involved in passing immigration reform.

68
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.350
Dreamers is the first step.

69
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.250
How are we supposed to whether we have almost a million, uh, Americans,

70
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.800
because they may not have a passport, but to me,

71
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.480
sometimes you don't belong to a place because they give you a paper.

72
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.650
You belong a place because you were hard to be long. Those reamers,

73
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.210
they are earned our respect by becoming young citizens,

74
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.220
almost a million strong.

75
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.260
Do you know how long it takes to train a workforce of a

76
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:49.770
million people? This is a NASAD for America.

77
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.660
I always said that the immigration reform is not a problem for America to

78
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:58.470
solve. It's an opportunity for America to cease.

79
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.610
Dreamers should be part of the American dream today,

80
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.840
but who people think is being feeding

81
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.760
America through this pandemic, the people that are,

82
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.070
that we can afford to be playing golf.

83
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.530
Who do you think is taking care of those golf courses?

84
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.320
Who do you think is refilling the shelves?

85
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.790
Who do you think is working the farms every day from sunrise to

86
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.550
sunset sometimes, uh,

87
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.480
badly paid badly treated without any, uh,

88
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.490
PPE to make them safe.

89
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.720
Who do you think is the people that they'd been

90
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.190
putting America forward through this entire pandemic?

91
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.380
Many Americans in the,

92
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.940
in the middle lower class that they've been working day in and day out to

93
00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:51.510
provide for the families, but indirectly to keep America moving,

94
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.490
but 11 million undocumented Americans I'm telling you,

95
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.080
they'd been in every corner of America through this pandemic,

96
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.640
moving America forward. Those men and women, they showed the value to America.

97
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.720
They show that they belong to America is about time that once,

98
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:12.050
and for all we pass comprehensive immigration reform.

99
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.060
America will win Republicans and Democrats will win because we all know an

100
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.060
undocumented. They are part of our lives. Our,

101
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:22.850
our communities is about time. We do this,

102
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:27.710
and I hope this pandemic towards 2021 will give the opportunity one day soon

103
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.410
enough to pass immigration reform,

104
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:33.920
to allow dreamers to belong and become American cities in some way,

105
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:37.520
not to give the opportunity to undocumented immigrants,

106
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:39.590
to have a legal status in this country.

107
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.680
<v 0>Uh, it's heartbreaking that we have missed the opportunities we've had Jose,</v>

108
00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:48.160
you know, that there were windows when, uh,

109
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.010
bipartisan legislators came forward and said,

110
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:54.400
we need a comprehensive approach to immigration. And everyone knows it.

111
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.840
Unfortunately,

112
00:06:55.841 --> 00:07:00.490
many politicians now feel like it's more advantageous to them to have

113
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:04.300
something, to make people upset, uh, than it is to,

114
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.650
to reach across the Island hammer out like, uh,

115
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.370
some kind of compromise or bi-partisan approach. Uh,

116
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.520
and we're seeing that in an, on multiple fronts,

117
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:19.180
unfortunately now with the pandemic, but immigration to me has to be very,

118
00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:23.920
very high on that list of things that Americans know that we

119
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.050
need needed years ago to have a more rational approach,

120
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.610
a humane approach,

121
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.260
a more clear eyed approach for the reality of the fact that so many of our

122
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:39.190
communities rely upon immigrants every single day. Uh,

123
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:41.890
and so your t-shirt is very apt. Um,

124
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.260
it's so inspiring to me to see someone like you who's come here

125
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.700
made so much of yourself,

126
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.710
but then also throwing yourself into multiple important causes right now,

127
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.640
fighting for restaurant tours, uh, for immigrant rights,

128
00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:02.320
but also you've led many humanitarian efforts around food and food

129
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:03.820
scarcity and food relief.

130
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.230
<v 1>We need a white house that recognizes the problem we're facing.</v>

131
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.640
And when you have a leader,

132
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.590
that seems not even to recognize we have a pandemic and

133
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:19.420
seems not to recognize how many businesses are suffering and

134
00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:24.220
who instead of coming up with the smart ideas and bills to invest into

135
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:27.010
solutions seems is throwing money at the problem.

136
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.270
We mean pain farmers across America, the big farmers,

137
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.580
because very bad policy in the white house fight with

138
00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:40.990
China, where actually now we are not better off. Uh,

139
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.390
maybe the precedent is showing, uh, uh,

140
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.410
everybody how strong he is against China by rhino with, uh,

141
00:08:47.411 --> 00:08:51.040
spending more money, paying subsidies to our farmers,

142
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:54.430
that they are not even producing food because the war with China,

143
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.420
we've spent four or five times, uh,

144
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.590
in those subsidies to farmers that we spend when we had the

145
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.420
automobile crisis and is not great in jobs is

146
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:09.330
only throwing money at the problem. The president Luke's good,

147
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:12.240
but he's really writing checks to farmers in the process.

148
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.510
We are not feeding America. This is to me insane.

149
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.640
That's why we need policies that they don't look that they are good.

150
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:23.190
So you can get boats on election day,

151
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.230
but policies that empower Americans to do well all

152
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:29.064
across.

153
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.180
We need the white house that recognizes the pandemic until we don't have that

154
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:34.380
leadership in place.

155
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.970
Everything is going to be hard because we require a very big

156
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.520
approach idea to have a big investment to regrow

157
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:47.670
the economy towards 2021, 2022.

158
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.720
And right now I don't see that leadership in the white house or in the Senate.

159
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.001
<v 0>Well, you know,</v>

160
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:57.290
I'm on board Jose that we need a different set of leaders in the white house.

161
00:09:57.291 --> 00:10:01.790
And hopefully we can turn the page for our country on November 3rd or

162
00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:06.140
thereabouts. Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation.
