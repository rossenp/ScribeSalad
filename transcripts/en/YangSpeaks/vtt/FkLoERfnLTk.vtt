1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>When we were talking you and I about politics a little, a little while ago,</v>

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.440
you said something that I thought was very interesting,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.280
which was that generally speaking, like the, um,

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.940
the funnier candidate will prevail when you're talking about something like

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.120
whatever theories, uh,

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.200
and then you suggested something really interesting to me, which was like, well,

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.830
you, which was like, you were thinking, maybe we should try. And, uh,

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.620
now the dynamic of this particular election is now completely changed.

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.160
Like in my opinion, Joe, you know, is, uh,

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.220
heavily favored in the polls now and we're in the midst of a crisis.

11
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.850
And so like the humor test, like at this point, everyone's like, screw that.

12
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.390
Like I'd rather just like a return to sanity. Um, but there was a,

13
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.400
uh, but I, there was a suggestion you had that I thought was really interesting.

14
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:47.671
You were like,

15
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:50.880
maybe we should get some comedy writers together to like write some, um,

16
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.770
some good scripts or lines for, uh, whoever the democratic nominee,

17
00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:00.090
like a, you know, like, uh, like, uh, may end up being an, I mean,

18
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:01.680
obviously we're in a different moment now,

19
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:05.490
but I thought that there was something really powerful to like your, uh,

20
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:09.600
your general thinking on it. Um, which is that at this point,

21
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.930
politicians are communicators. Um,

22
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.110
and there's like certain language that they use to communicate, uh, you know,

23
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.710
that, uh, is hitting with certain groups of Americans,

24
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:24.330
like maybe less so for others, but I was part of these debates, uh,

25
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.150
Judd. And it was clear to me that,

26
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:28.770
that some of the candidates definitely had jokes that they'd rehearsed,

27
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.740
that they, they, they, they certainly had stuff that they'd like practiced.

28
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.660
And we do have these debates upcoming between Joe and Donald Trump.

29
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.430
That may be one of the only, uh,

30
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.990
set of events that could potentially even change the dynamic of the race.

31
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:46.824
Meaningfully.

32
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.100
<v 1>I think that, you know, in America,</v>

33
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.510
unfortunately,

34
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.820
so much of it is entertainment and people are taken in by

35
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.660
charisma sense of humor, attractiveness,

36
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.860
and a lot of the presidents from the past that maybe had, you know,

37
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.210
we're not appealing to look at or listen to, but who happened to be brilliant.

38
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.450
Uh, maybe some of those people would not be elected today. You know,

39
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:18.050
there are a lot of people who are incredible at their jobs who are really, uh,

40
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.030
not, uh, pleasant to talk to or, or, or look at. They're not funny,

41
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.740
but maybe they're just amazing at making the correct

42
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:32.500
choices or thoughtful, difficult choices. And if you look back,

43
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.880
I, I joke about this, but I do think it's true.

44
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:39.560
You tend to see that the slightly more entertaining or warmer candidate

45
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.420
often wins. I mean, when Al Gore lost,

46
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.130
I remember being pretty shocked because when you watch the debates,

47
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.450
you know, George Bush was terrible in those, in those debates,

48
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.920
but he did have a certain charm about him and the country was doing great at

49
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:00.970
that moment, the economy strong.

50
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 0>Beer with competition. I remember that.</v>

51
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.290
<v 1>And, and it was almost like the, the country had a Clinton fatigue,</v>

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.730
a scandal fatigue,

53
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.700
and they weren't factoring in the fact that the country was operating in,

54
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.700
in, and, you know, for our country pretty well,

55
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.020
the economy was doing very well. It wasn't a moment to toss out the Democrats,

56
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.750
but a board country is seeking

57
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.160
entertainment and a friend. And, and, and,

58
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.070
and I think that that has happened many times in our,

59
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:38.320
in our history where we're attracted to that.

60
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:40.390
And I think you might say the same thing about Donald Trump,

61
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.290
where he's more of an aggressive insult comic, um,

62
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.520
and people didn't pay attention to the fact that he had ripped off a lot of

63
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.150
students that he didn't pay his bills, that he was, uh, you know,

64
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.460
awful to women. Uh, you know,

65
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.500
there were so many very clear signals to us that he was corrupt

66
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.980
and not empathetic and a dangerous person,

67
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.300
but people bought into his bravado,

68
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:11.080
his entertainment factor, and he had no record.

69
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:12.550
So it was easy for him to say,

70
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.410
Hillary Clinton is corrupt because he hadn't held any elective office.

71
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.450
He didn't have to come through on any of his promises.

72
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.870
I think if you look at what, what happened,

73
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.330
he really didn't accomplish any of the things that he was talking about. Yeah.

74
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.210
<v 0>W what you're saying is spot on Judd,</v>

75
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:34.170
and this is one of the great dynamics that I'm scratching my head about it to

76
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:36.390
some level with concern, um,

77
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.080
which is that it seems like politics and entertainment have, uh,

78
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.140
have merged and at least in some respects.

79
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.200
And then if you have some larger than life, uh,

80
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.320
figure that millions of Americans in the case of Donald Trump felt like they

81
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:53.550
knew from the apprentice and other things. And then like, he like overrode,

82
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.540
um, a lot of other, like the rest of the Republican field.

83
00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:59.100
And then it was him against Hillary.

84
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:02.610
He seemed somehow more entertaining and appealing and like quote unquote,

85
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:06.960
authentic, uh, and the democratic field too. There was something that happened.

86
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.600
And I was the beneficiary of this. So it's not, not a knock, but like,

87
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.910
let's say you have folks like Steve Bullock,

88
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.060
governor of Montana who makes a late entrance into the race,

89
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.520
or Michael Bennett Senator from Colorado,

90
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:22.200
who like people didn't find particularly exciting or whatnot that, uh,

91
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:26.940
that they got, uh, ignored and blown off more or less. Um,

92
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.690
and then if you have like the magical Asian man who wants to give everyone money

93
00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:32.730
and like, who came from the internet, then, like,

94
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:37.380
I became more of like a figure in part, because like, I was more interesting.

95
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.320
Um, now this is not something I'm,

96
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.030
I think is necessarily like a super positive in a

97
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.730
American like politics, you know,

98
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:51.390
like I happen to think boasty Bullock and Michael Bennett, um, uh,

99
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.720
deserved more attention than they got, um, from voters or from in, you know,

100
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.910
um, folks in, in, uh, the know, um,

101
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.250
and it's one reason why you have people suggesting completely seriously

102
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.330
that, you know,

103
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.660
the rock should run for president or like someone that we all know.

104
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.323
<v 1>Kanye.</v>

105
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.170
<v 0>Tucker Carlson, like, you know, on like on the Republican side,</v>

106
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.990
who is like a commentator entertainer,

107
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:24.770
but at this point that things have kind of merged where if you have like a very

108
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:29.570
prominent public persona, then that actually is like a massive,

109
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.110
um, value add in terms of your political currency.

110
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.060
<v 1>Absolutely. And it's scary. I mean,</v>

111
00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:41.560
we don't quite understand the Kanye West motivations. You know,

112
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:45.280
there are some people who would read, uh,

113
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.690
something into it about him wanting to split the vote. Uh, uh,

114
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.340
and then other people who think like, no,

115
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:56.140
the whole thing is just a manic episode and there is no logic behind it

116
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.950
or, or, or vision. He's just having a meltdown.

117
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.420
But regardless they say in certain States, when they did some quick polling,

118
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.190
maybe already had 2% or 4%. And that's,

119
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:14.080
what's scary about the idea of unqualified people jumping

120
00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:18.490
in because clearly our country has not been discerning enough

121
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.170
to say,

122
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.870
I don't think being on the apprentice is enough to run the

123
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.060
country. I don't,

124
00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:31.990
I don't think having those bankruptcies and running hotels make sense for

125
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.550
some qualified.

126
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.660
And so we are scared when we hear Trump's kids are gonna run one day or Tucker

127
00:07:37.661 --> 00:07:42.100
Carlson or, or, or, you know, or the rock where you, you think, Oh,

128
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:45.790
no, I want somebody who really understands how government works.

129
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.980
I want somebody who,

130
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.520
who has a vision that I agree with.

131
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.460
I don't want to just be somebody who's popular. No,

132
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:58.840
it's not impossible that a famous person can turn out to be,

133
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.150
uh, a wise thoughtful, good president it's. But man, it's, that's, uh,

134
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.830
the percentages of that are probably still pretty scary, pretty low.

135
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:10.330
And we see it with Donald Trump. Now,

136
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.470
his lack of experience means he doesn't really understand how to work

137
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.920
government. He doesn't know how to get masks made.

138
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:22.360
He doesn't know how to get enough test tubes so that you could do the testing

139
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.830
and he doesn't want to,

140
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.120
he literally doesn't even want to find out how to do it because he is lazy.

141
00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:31.600
He clearly has educational issues. He doesn't think well. And so he says,

142
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:36.460
let the governors handle it because he can't manage a gigantic

143
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.480
bureaucracy. And we need people that know how to do that.

144
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.110
<v 0>You know, what's tough. Judd is. And I, I generally agree with, uh,</v>

145
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:45.970
with a lot of what you just said. Um,

146
00:08:45.971 --> 00:08:48.220
just so many Americans have looked up and been like, man,

147
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:49.510
this stuff's not been working for us.

148
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:52.810
And even when you and I talked about like the good times of when Al Gore was

149
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:56.070
running in 2000 and you made the caveat, which was right, is like,

150
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.540
like relatively speaking things were, were good. Um, at that point,

151
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.840
even though now, yeah. To now,

152
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.110
but we also recognize that like, uh, that there's been a lot,

153
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.260
there've been a lot of people left behind even like the relatively good times,

154
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:14.850
bad times are showing just how exposed many American families are, where,

155
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:17.970
you know, like that, like, there's like, uh, uh,

156
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.000
just financial insecurity everywhere. And like, uh,

157
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.730
and many Americans have felt excluded from, uh,

158
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.190
even the gains that have been made. Uh,

159
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.800
and there are so many Americans that just look up and be like, man,

160
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:33.780
like even under the Democrats, like, you know, my factory was closing,

161
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:36.400
my main street stores were closing because the Amazon, like, they,

162
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.690
they look up and they're like, not sure, uh, in my opinion, that's what,

163
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:44.370
one of the things that fuels like our interest in these folks from

164
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.650
outside government, because like, like the, the,

165
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.900
because people have lost faith in a lot of things in our society. Um, but,

166
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.280
but like one of the things they've lost faith in is that if they get, uh,

167
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.330
like the other party into power in DC,

168
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:03.810
that things will make meaningfully change where like in their school or on their

169
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:06.720
street, or like, you know, these things now, all of that said,

170
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:09.630
I'm obviously very pro Biden have endorsed him.

171
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:11.970
I've been doing everything I can to help. Um,

172
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.770
and I get the sense from what you've just said,

173
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:16.830
that you are also pulling for a team, Joe,

174
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.050
that's the fall. I don't think that's like much of a stretch. Um,

175
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.880
so we'd love to hear like, uh, what you're seeing.

176
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.690
And also if there are particular races that you're, um,

177
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.670
like focused on outside of the big kahuna race between Joe and Donald Trump,

178
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.270
where the, there are some political candidates that have caught your eye. Um,

179
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.270
certainly on our side, there are, you know, um,

180
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.610
a number of candidates that I'm trying to help an elevate,

181
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.650
like at the local levels. Um, and was wondering if, if there were, uh,

182
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.510
people that you were working with on that side?

183
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.930
<v 1>Well, I think that, um, you know, it's very important that, uh,</v>

184
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.930
Democrats will win the Senate because

185
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.420
I think, you know, if you were to envision what the next four years would be,

186
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:07.790
if, if Joe Biden was the president,

187
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.250
we're going to be in the midst of the pandemic into next year,

188
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.150
maybe beyond into 22,

189
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.740
it also might be something that is around in some form chronically

190
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.720
where it's like the flu in the sense that we're getting shots every year.

191
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.490
And what if the shot only works 50% of the time? I mean, the flu shot,

192
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.290
we all get it. And some years we're like, Oh,

193
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:35.180
they didn't get the right one this year.

194
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.230
So we don't know how many years we're going to be dealing with this where it's

195
00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:42.320
very serious. Hopefully there'll be some sort of, you know,

196
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.070
medicines that help us, even if we do get it where it's not as dangerous,

197
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.580
we don't know yet, but that could play out over years. Yes.

198
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.520
So we have to also assume that that the

199
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:59.440
country will be very impatient for solutions from the

200
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:03.430
next president economic solutions for the disaster.

201
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:07.620
That's clearly coming from all of this and also the,

202
00:12:07.621 --> 00:12:08.890
the medical issues.

203
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.080
And if something really meaningful does not happen,

204
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.740
then Joe Biden will be a one-term president. I there's a chance.

205
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:20.770
He's a one term president anyway. Uh,

206
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.610
maybe another Democrat will run after four years.

207
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.280
And so without the Senate, um,

208
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.460
I don't think he'll be able to make large scale meaningful change

209
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.630
in the country and be able to fix a lot of what we've learned about how badly

210
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.790
our institutions work. I mean,

211
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:43.600
we're basically finding out on a daily basis that on almost any issue,

212
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.370
you could take it to the Supreme court.

213
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.230
It takes years and you don't actually get solutions. Uh,

214
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.530
you can't even find out if you're allowed to,

215
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.940
if the Congress has lets us subpoena people to speak to committees,

216
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.050
right? We're,

217
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.790
we're still not sure if they're allowed to force people to answer questions,

218
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:08.020
to be held accountable for their work for the country. Uh,

219
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:13.090
and you could kick the can down the street on almost anything

220
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:17.860
in the courts, right? So the justice system is, is, is a complete mess.

221
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.480
The courts are a complete mess.

222
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.950
And my concern is that

223
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.210
if things don't turn around and it goes right back to the Republicans in four

224
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:32.740
years, and what it will be is a smarter Donald Trump,

225
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.690
a less demented Donald Trump with the same

226
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.720
long-term vision. I mean, Donald Trump is not a very efficient person.

227
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.620
You don't know what we don't even know how much of these choices he makes are

228
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:52.240
his are just the people around him who are able to get ideas through

229
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.720
this strange man. You know, when I hear that, like,

230
00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:57.150
they're not going to let they, they,

231
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.010
they try to not let students stay in the country.

232
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.040
If their college switches to zoom classes.

233
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.480
I don't think Donald Trump was in a room and thought that up, you know, that's.

234
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.950
<v 0>That is the thing that many people are concerned about. Judd is like, uh,</v>

235
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.540
imagine competent and malevolent, uh, you know, as opposed to yeah.

236
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.140
<v 1>You know, you know, there's all these people, uh, that are truly dangerous,</v>

237
00:14:22.141 --> 00:14:25.320
that it could swing back to them very quickly.

238
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.170
If the country is still struggling in a few years and you know,

239
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.750
what the country will be struggling. And, and so what,

240
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:36.690
what kind of president who controls the Congress and the Senate do in terms of,

241
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:41.850
of healthcare in terms of, you know, larger changes.

242
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.260
