1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>So, uh, it's great to reconnect.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.990
I got to meet you and your beautiful family in the magical town of yellow

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:07.351
Springs,

4
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:12.120
Ohio this summer as part of freaking

5
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:16.830
camp Chappelle, it was amazing. I've got a t-shirt,

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.300
uh, I've got memories.

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.040
<v 1>They really, it was like a summer camp.</v>

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.770
<v 2>I ended up, I ended up going pretty crazy there. I bought them,</v>

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.650
I bought a scooter and then three other motorcycles.

10
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.280
And so somebody had an accident on my moped.

11
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.340
Like they on my motorcycle and they hurt themselves pretty badly,

12
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:36.110
like their crack, their shoulder and stuff.

13
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.101
<v 0>Wait, so that,</v>

14
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:41.000
that happened before I got on Michelle's moped and was like running around.

15
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.230
So everybody was looking at you like, Oh,

16
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.900
that's why everyone was scared shitless, because I was like, guys,

17
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.710
I'm an adult male. Like this isn't like a, you know,

18
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.620
freaking Harley or something like it's right.

19
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.490
<v 2>I think next thing you know,</v>

20
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.960
parking parking a scooter can fracture to your shoulders. I still to this day,

21
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:07.310
don't know how he did it, but you know, I'm glad he's okay, Matthew, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.320
I love you. I hope you're well, yeah.

23
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.260
<v 0>Shout out to you, Matthew. Hope your shoulders are all right.</v>

24
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.520
I'm so glad that at least some people were documenting parts of the camp

25
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:17.810
experience. Cause I, you know,

26
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.380
I know that that someone was working on a project for it. Uh,

27
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.610
and I can see exactly how you got addicted to buying two wheeled vehicles there.

28
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.320
Cause it's summer, it's beautiful. You're just roaming around. Uh,

29
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.480
and so I see why he didn't stop at the moped.

30
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.320
I defend you Mo I defend you and your three motorcycles, uh, on top of it.

31
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.940
<v 2>I appreciate it. I needed that. You know,</v>

32
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.040
I was going really smart cause I was like, yeah,

33
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.290
I haven't written motorcycles at least 12 years.

34
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.580
So let's get like a 120 CC little scoot situation,

35
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.400
put a boom box. It's almost bigger than the tires,

36
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.350
scooter itself on the back of it. Enjoy these, you know, cinematic.

37
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.070
<v 0>Beautiful, gorgeous. You go there. Like, you know,</v>

38
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:00.890
you just look out it's like Americana,

39
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.960
Corrine feels like such a, it was gorgeous.

40
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.980
<v 2>Pretend like I'm an American pickers. I would constantly like stop.</v>

41
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:13.220
And she's like, Oh, what does this item is? Santiq from the forties.

42
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.480
It was very nice. Like stop at a rusted filled farm or something like,

43
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.830
and I would attempt to buy some of their junk that's in the yard.

44
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:25.790
That's like one of my favorite past times when I was just trying to decompress,

45
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.800
it was so much fun. It was so much fun.

46
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.070
<v 0>So how did your wife feel about the purchases?</v>

47
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.160
<v 2>This is a common question. More common,</v>

48
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.970
more common than I ever thought it would be. Yeah. It's just like, I don't,

49
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:38.630
I didn't really tell.

50
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.463
<v 1>Her.</v>

51
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.630
<v 2>I just did it. I was very smart about it though.</v>

52
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.460
It was like a traditional Arab trader. I was like, I don't know. You know,

53
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.950
I was really like checking out the market. One of the.

54
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.070
<v 0>Honey, I bought the death machine smart.</v>

55
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.590
I was a savvy death machine buyer.

56
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.950
<v 2>She divorced me. You know, that's how, that's how this all works. You know?</v>

57
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 0>Uh, it's a very clear progression. Uh, you know that, that's why they have that,</v>

58
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.550
uh, divorce lawyer office attached to the motorcycle dealer.

59
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.790
<v 1>I bet there's a few of them, dude. This is.</v>

60
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.930
<v 0>A billion dollar business idea. That's why, uh,</v>

61
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.840
I'm the entrepreneur, I've got a vision. I,

62
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.340
you can attach all sorts of midlife crises services to the

63
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.610
motorcycle dealership. It's like what? You're here buying a bike.

64
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.890
<v 2>You like these brand new overprice sunglasses that make you look 30 years</v>

65
00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:39.780
younger. That's how I justified my purchases. And like sunglasses. I have a,

66
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:40.051
you know,

67
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:43.530
you can't just buy regular sunglasses where else you just destroy them,

68
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.060
throw them out. You won't respect them.

69
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.950
You have to buy something of value that you have to care for them.

70
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.770
Especially if they have like resale value as well. Like, Oh no,

71
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:57.030
I can't lose these. Where are these? It makes you way more conscious of them.

72
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.830
<v 0>I think to me, there's like a threshold where something becomes real and uh,</v>

73
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.310
it's reality often is commensurate to whatever you paid for it. You know,

74
00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.950
it's like, if you buy like $5 sunglasses, they're not real.

75
00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:11.160
You can like lose them, sit on them. Like no one cares.

76
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.840
But then as soon as you break through a certain investment threshold, uh,

77
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.980
then all of a sudden it's like, okay,

78
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:20.040
this is an actual item of mine that I associate with myself.

79
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.750
And it says something about me and I take pride in or whatever it is.

80
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.470
What is that threshold for me? When does something become real?

81
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.160
When does it become.

82
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.993
<v 1>Come real?</v>

83
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.670
<v 2>It doesn't exist. Otherwise it's garbage. So.</v>

84
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.190
<v 0>So I'm in Atlanta, Georgia. I don't know, like I'm,</v>

85
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:42.990
I'm campaigning for the special Senate candidate that's and I was

86
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.660
getting some food, my family's on those curbside pickup things.

87
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:50.130
And so I stopped to park the car. There's an automated reader. Uh,

88
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.100
and I was like, I don't know how long it's gonna take me to pick up this food.

89
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.640
So I stick the credit card in the reader and I'm just jamming in like add time,

90
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.800
add time, add time. Because like, I was like, I don't,

91
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.880
I don't want to calculate.

92
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.820
<v 1>Like, like, like that.</v>

93
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.190
<v 0>Twenty-five set per eight minute threshold.</v>

94
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.070
I don't want to like cut it that close. Cause like you,

95
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:12.270
who knows how long that like some of these, these places take. So like that,

96
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:15.870
that parking experience was like below my reality threshold. I was just like,

97
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.500
like let's just make it so that, um,

98
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:19.200
I'm not going to have to deal with this for a minute.

99
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.620
It's one reason I became so passionate about universal basic income. I mean,

100
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:24.880
there are a lot of reasons, but uh, just like,

101
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:29.460
w we're we're now such a society of folks who are making that time, money,

102
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.140
trade off all of the time. Uh, and I still do it obviously. Um,

103
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.680
though now the threshold has to be higher for me to say like, okay,

104
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:40.890
it's going to be worth my cycles to try and save that quarter or whatever it is

105
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.100
when I was a kid growing up, the child of immigrants in this country,

106
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:48.990
like a quarter was precious and I would go to the arcade and then play it and

107
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:51.000
then just try and win for as long as possible.

108
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:54.090
It's like you had to like stretch the value of that quarter to a point where,

109
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.640
uh, you know, like you could entertain yourself all day.

110
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.930
<v 2>Ideally that street fighter game at the Cornerstore before high school or after</v>

111
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.170
high school was like the one, you know, that's, that's the game.

112
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.920
If you can just make that quarter, keep that. And that was it. That.

113
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.960
<v 0>Was like our test of value as like a teenager. It's like,</v>

114
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.860
if you can win and then it became, not only can you win,

115
00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:20.770
but can you win with an obscure character? It's like,

116
00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:25.210
it's not enough to be good at view or guile and defend your quarter.

117
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.210
But then eventually when you're like, I'm just going to screw around.

118
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.350
I'm just going to choose blocks.

119
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.510
<v 2>[Inaudible] Oh my God never knew how to play with that guy.</v>

120
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.920
And then there'd be like this.

121
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.360
<v 0>From like the people being like, used to like blog it's like,</v>

122
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.840
it was like a real expression of, of like confidence or cockiness.

123
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.800
The ultimate cockiness was the Holocene, which is now that I reflect on it,

124
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.290
a somewhat racist portrayal of like a Hindu warrior.

125
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.240
<v 2>[Inaudible] it just like sat there for a second. Now that I think about it,</v>

126
00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:06.190
just like maybe it was a racist, just seeing this kid,

127
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:09.430
like I saw the kid in you, like, now that I think about it, maybe,

128
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.930
maybe I shouldn't have played with that care.

129
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.400
<v 0>Awful as a character, you know, like he was like the shirt,</v>

130
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.290
the closest thing to a sure loss.

131
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.990
<v 2>It was if you played with that guy.</v>

132
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.110
<v 0>Uh, it could be that Mo and I are somewhat dating ourselves.</v>

133
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.180
It seems like you and I came of age around the same time,

134
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.700
but I feel like even the kids know, street fighter, I hope it's a turtle.

135
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:28.720
I hope it's one of those things.

136
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.120
<v 2>He was playing a street fighter and mortal combat just over Thanksgiving. Nice.</v>

137
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.510
Yes. But it was like, wow. Oh,

138
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:39.540
this is the mortal Kombat y'all are growing up with,

139
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.170
is it much better than ours so much better?

140
00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:47.740
The graphics are INSEAD arguable? No, it depends.

141
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:51.340
I actually liked the classic. I mean, just seeing what they're dealing with.

142
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.840
I mean, seeing the graphics, I kind of miss the dodgy graphics and uh,

143
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.360
you know, and, and seeing the pit of death, you know,

144
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.190
like it's a little bit different than a little bit more group,

145
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.230
like really gruesome. Actually.

146
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.520
<v 0>I am definitely old enough now where I look back on certain things as like the</v>

147
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.720
standard or the golden years, you know what I mean? Like that, like, um,

148
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.180
nineties video games, uh, eighties and nineties music, like it comes on,

149
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:18.550
I'm like, Oh, it doesn't make no, they don't make this. Like they used to.

150
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.350
<v 2>You reminded me of a joke, uh, uh, an amazing comedian, uh,</v>

151
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.640
Jack Mayberry. He's about to give a ride around, uh, uh, with somebody old.

152
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.790
They're always tell you where things didn't use to be, you know,

153
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.040
you just be sitting there going okay, that there,

154
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.370
it wasn't there all the way from there all the way to over there that wasn't

155
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:38.080
there either. Hey, look at that, that wasn't there.

156
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.260
That wasn't there from all the way from there and all the way into it.

157
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:44.410
Wasn't there. Hell it was hell, it was just dark. It's not an out here,

158
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.600
you know, it's just so fast what you reminded me of right now.

159
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.120
<v 0>And that's actually a reasonable summation of what's gone wrong with the</v>

160
00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:52.750
country, which is that it really is a, Hey,

161
00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:57.180
we need to change things versus no stay the same, uh,

162
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.600
like have the same rules for ever. Uh,

163
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.060
and then we don't really have the capacity to actually change some of these

164
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:07.650
institutions, explain that for a lot of people are upset over the fact that, uh,

165
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.390
the electoral college and the popular vote aren't lining up terribly well. Um,

166
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.980
so you have folks who want to get rid of the electoral college.

167
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.320
Uh, but in order to get rid of the electoral college,

168
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:21.720
you need a super majority of States to get on board with that.

169
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:25.110
And like there's zero chance that Kansas and Nebraska are going to be like,

170
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:27.360
you're right. Like we shouldn't have this much say.

171
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.760
<v 2>So it's one of those things.</v>

172
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.610
<v 0>Where you look at and be like, look, this is not changing in the way that, uh,</v>

173
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.220
some people are arguing in any realistic fashion,

174
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:37.870
as long as you have that standard. There,

175
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.590
there are a lot of things that right now we're having a trouble we're having

176
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:45.180
trouble shifting because there's really no consensus or no

177
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.500
governing majority. Uh, and it's something that makes me very sad.

178
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:52.560
It's why I'm in Georgia honestly, is that, uh,

179
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:57.180
I hoped that we would have a government that could actually

180
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.750
address some of the big problems coming into 2021,

181
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.300
cause we've got major problems. Uh,

182
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.740
and instead it looks like we're going to struggle with a degree of

183
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.030
gridlock and dysfunction for the foreseeable. Uh, and,

184
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.320
and so you have this framework that set up that that says what you can do

185
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.790
and you can't change it unless you had let's, let's call it a super majority.

186
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.470
Let's call it 60 senators or whatever it is in the current rules. Uh, and,

187
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.710
and so the frustration is setting in on both sides.

188
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.790
We're having increasingly incoherent conversations about it. Uh,

189
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.850
and it makes me very sad. It makes me very sad too. Like I,

190
00:10:36.851 --> 00:10:39.810
I told you in the beginning of this conversation, I mean,

191
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:40.820
you were the first campaign.

192
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.830
<v 2>Than I ever vote. I mean, like, not only did I want to vote for you,</v>

193
00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:50.660
but I contributed too. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for listening in.

194
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:54.950
