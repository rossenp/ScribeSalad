WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>Welcoming to yang speaks a man after my own heart entrepreneur</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.490
congressional candidate in Florida's third district, which is,

3
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:11.610
I want to say Gainesville, Adam Kristin saying welcome Adam.

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.510
<v 1>Hey, Hey, how are you.</v>

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.210
<v 0>Adam? I love your story because you are a true startup guy. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.350
you started a company moved across the country for it. Uh,

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.920
and then you looked up at your congressional representatives and were like,

8
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.650
you know what, like I think I might be able to,

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.450
to offer something and contribute. And then you shocked, uh,

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.150
expectations. You became the democratic nominee.

11
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:42.170
I think you may be the youngest congressional candidate in the country right

12
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:43.070
now. Is that right?

13
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.060
<v 1>At least democratic. Yeah. Although I turned 27 a couple of days ago,</v>

14
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:51.350
so I'm going to have to check again, not sure at this point. Okay.

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.250
<v 0>Well, you're up there in terms of, uh, youthful</v>

16
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.850
youthful candidates, uh, and your opponent is, uh,

17
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.030
someone who I think she,

18
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:07.130
she worked for the former rep who kind of made a name for himself

19
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.510
by being a. It's not like he was like,

20
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.050
it's funny how these lines intersect, but, uh,

21
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:17.360
you can go ahead and share this story about, uh,

22
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.120
I guess both the incumbent right now. Who's,

23
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.520
who's getting out of the way and then your opponent.

24
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.770
<v 1>Yeah. So, um, Ted yo ho kind of, you know, kind of gave us a gift.</v>

25
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.040
He actually put this race on the map. Uh, he's the one that, uh,

26
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.730
verbally assaulted, uh, AOC on the Capitol steps. Um,

27
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.210
he's also one of the four people who voted against making lynching a federal

28
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:41.990
crime. Uh, and he also didn't like the survivor's bill of rights.

29
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.740
The era didn't think the, uh, what was it? The, um, Oh, shoot.

30
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:47.630
The voting rights act was constitutional.

31
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.440
That's something that he didn't think so is like all of these things he'd been

32
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:52.340
doing for years,

33
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.000
but nobody really saw exactly who he was until the AOC incident,

34
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.840
at which point people started to even realize that a Gainesville existed.

35
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.820
And so that was a, you know, that's kinda,

36
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.990
that was really where our campaign really, it was a jumping off point, honestly,

37
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.690
it was a bunch of people that kind of realized that, you know,

38
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.970
this is the guy who's been here for a long time. Uh,

39
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.900
and we basically need to tear down his infrastructure, uh,

40
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.660
with progressive ideas and preferably with young people.

41
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.340
And it really just shot off from there.

42
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.390
<v 0>Yeah. So tell us a little bit more about the Genesis of your campaign.</v>

43
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:26.120
I'm sure when you were first talking about running, people were like,

44
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:30.560
what you know, or, or thought that that was a lot to bite off,

45
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.480
but you ended up inspiring a lot of young people in a college town, uh,

46
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.630
getting a ton of energy and then growing from there.

47
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:42.920
Can you tell us about how you got started and really why you decided to get into

48
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:43.754
this race?

49
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.970
<v 1>Yeah. Um, you know, one of the biggest things for me, I mean,</v>

50
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:51.080
I always enjoyed politics. Like I just enjoyed it and like, I'd always thought,

51
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:54.320
you know, someday, maybe I might try to run for something,

52
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.130
but I never really had any actual idea about it. Uh, and then, you know,

53
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:00.430
tried to grow as, you know,

54
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:04.330
the startup stage where effectively you get so big and at a certain point you

55
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.790
have to start offering benefits to be able to keep growing.

56
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.730
And a lot of startups just cannot get over that hurdle.

57
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.780
And so that was one of the main reasons that caused me to jump into this was,

58
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.081
you know,

59
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.530
I had two companies and they both got to that hurdle and I saw a bunch of other

60
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.310
small ones that got to that hurdle and they either sold to bigger people or they

61
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:25.690
just petered out or, or they tried to get out of it. Uh, and so for me,

62
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.750
that's when I kind of realized, you know, that, you know,

63
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.870
somebody needed to change that. And at the same time I was,

64
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.270
I had looked and saw that Ted Johan was going to retire.

65
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.450
And so I looked and saw who the democratic people were that were running.

66
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.070
And I just, I wasn't really impressed.

67
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.100
And I was kind of complaining and somebody was like, well, you know what?

68
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.070
You don't really get to complain if you're not going to do something about it.

69
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.360
And so my response to that was okay, well, how would you get on the ballot?

70
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.310
And so then I took the puppy out.

71
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.700
We went out and tried to get as many petitions as we could in the farmer's

72
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.121
market.

73
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.510
And within about two weeks we had almost 600 different petitions that have been

74
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.770
signed. And then I basically started talking to people, um,

75
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:04.210
and I sat down at a coffee shop with, uh,

76
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.570
the person who became my campaign manager, his name's Anton Kernaghan,

77
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:12.160
he just turned 21. He was an environmental activist. And I talked to him,

78
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.610
basically. I was like, look like, this is what I care about. And he was like,

79
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:17.110
this is what I care about. And I was like, well,

80
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.600
what if we give both of those things, a bigger platform?

81
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:22.930
And we actually try to run and do something here. And he's like, you know what,

82
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.570
that's great. And so it started with one person.

83
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.310
And then within the next couple of days,

84
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:30.160
we had about four and then the next week we had 10.

85
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.120
And then eventually we got up to 50 were all under the age of 23.

86
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.860
And basically we were running because we believed that things could actually

87
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:43.510
change and get better and nobody else was going to do it. And so we had to,

88
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.670
and that's really what we did and what we've continued to do.

89
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.520
And I don't know, you know, that we've inspired people.

90
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:54.730
I just know that we're doing what we believe is right,

91
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.340
and what we believe somebody needs to do.

92
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.820
And we're seeing a lot of support of people that believe exactly what we

93
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:01.091
believe.

94
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.790
And I have just been waiting for somebody to come out and say it because they

95
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:04.870
believed it for so long,

96
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:09.100
but nobody has been willing to speak truth to power and actually come out and

97
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:13.030
say what they believe and fight for it. And so that's kind of,

98
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:14.920
what's propelled us so far, I think.

99
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.680
<v 0>Yeah. It's, uh, it's um, very relatable story on several levels.</v>

100
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:22.680
I agree with you that startups have been, uh,

101
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.630
hindered by the fact that we've just put so much on

102
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.220
small businesses in terms of, uh, benefits, health care, like, I mean,

103
00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:36.450
I've run companies and it's true when you make that transition where you are

104
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:41.280
providing full on benefits to folks and people are making multi-year commitments

105
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.810
to you. It's a lot of pressure as a company and right now we made it. So that,

106
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:49.140
that pressure of breaks a lot of startups to your point, uh,

107
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:52.260
what were the startups you were involved with? Uh, you know, I remember the one,

108
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:55.290
but I want you to speak to it a little bit. So people get a sense of, uh,

109
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.950
what brought you here. So the first one.

110
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.300
<v 1>That I started right out of college,</v>

111
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:03.920
I had about $3,000 in my pocket that I'd made from odd jobs working in the

112
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:07.670
summer on that, on the drive. Uh, and it was essentially,

113
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.040
it was catching international suppliers,

114
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.670
trying to screw over family owned businesses and American businesses here that

115
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:14.900
were selling natural products.

116
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:18.350
The second company really focused on kind of the hemp and CBD industries,

117
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.670
which are booming brand new industries, but have zero regulation.

118
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:25.760
Nobody's actually looking out for other people or trying to hold others

119
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:27.980
accountable. And so that was really what I was doing.

120
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.140
And I kind of feel like it's a good transition,

121
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.890
especially to politics because that's what congressional representatives are

122
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.840
supposed to do. They are supposed to hold people who try to take care of, uh,

123
00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:40.940
advantage of those in their community accountable and stop them.

124
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.550
<v 0>Yeah. Th there's, well, there's a lot of that going on, unfortunately,</v>

125
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.870
which brings us to your opponent who has like this backstory that a very,

126
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.180
I could be confused by. So it's like, okay,

127
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:56.130
I get Ted yo ho he's been there for a long time. He's like a, you know,

128
00:06:56.131 --> 00:07:00.100
a rich businessman, lawyer type. Um, and then, but your opponent is not Ted.

129
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.630
Your opponent is his former employee of some

130
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:09.520
kind who worked in like a communications, uh, capacity. Is that right?

131
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:10.354
It's a little fuzzy.

132
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.460
<v 1>It's very well here's the thing is it's very fuzzy because it keeps changing</v>

133
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.110
like every other day. Um, so here's what we know. We actually,

134
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.620
we went and looked into this person because you know,

135
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.200
in what I do is I essentially, you know,

136
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.070
try to look through marketing and BS and try to see what is real, what is not,

137
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.230
and be able to actually know. Um,

138
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.100
and so we started to looking into this person and the very first thing I saw,

139
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.650
the first commercial I ever saw her was she goes,

140
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:43.510
I grew up on a cattle ranch in Colorado and Obama bankrupted me and I was

141
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:46.870
homeless. And I was like, you know, that's an incredible story.

142
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.570
I wonder if any part of.

143
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.700
<v 0>Lit literally unbelievable.</v>

144
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.050
<v 1>Like you, I love like, I don't know who you are, but like, you got me, like,</v>

145
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.570
I'm ready for this story. Like I wouldn't know about it.

146
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.320
And so I looked into it and I couldn't find the cattle ranch.

147
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.880
Like the first,

148
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:06.790
most simple thing is I grew up on a cattle ranch and I couldn't find it

149
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.820
anywhere. No property records nothing. And so like,

150
00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:13.420
we spent weeks looking for this thing and then we finally threw it out on

151
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:15.190
Twitter and we're like, all right, internet,

152
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.310
go find this because we can't find it. And whatever you find,

153
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.840
you use the hashtag hashtag where's the cattle ranch and tell us what you find.

154
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.200
And they found so many things, but they couldn't find a cattle ranch.

155
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.393
It was it say.

156
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.620
And so we eventually found a piece of land that was apparently bought

157
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:36.190
by her mom at one point, but there were no buildings on it.

158
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.090
They never lived there. So it was not a cattle ranch on top of that,

159
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:42.880
they took seven different loans out over 12 years,

160
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:46.060
they had $350,000 in debt.

161
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.110
And eventually they were foreclosed on, but it was not because of Obama.

162
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.980
It was because she went on 108 day cruise.

163
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.640
They cost 30 grand across the world.

164
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.710
And she literally caused her family to lose their piece of land. On top of that,

165
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:04.080
it was right after she graduated from college.

166
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.700
And so she literally transitioned out of college housing to an apartment slash

167
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:12.150
hotel and then joined Ted yo-yo staff.

168
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.960
But she said that because she had lived in a hotel, she was quote homeless.

169
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.860
And she said the hotel was so bad that she called it, quote a crack house.

170
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.730
So literally everything about her was completely fake.

171
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.390
And this was before she even got into politics. And so right at that moment,

172
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.500
we knew that some,

173
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.490
like there had to be things that had happened and because this is not a story

174
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:36.810
that most people have ever experienced or seen. And so it was incredible for us.

175
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.680
Um, she was his chief of staff. Uh,

176
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.700
she was 24 years old and about a year in, she was fired by Ted Yohan,

177
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.720
but he refused to say why. And she was actually just,

178
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.710
she was demoted and shipped back to Gainesville, Florida when she got there,

179
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.690
the entire staff in Washington was purged and she set up a consulting firm

180
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.730
while still on his payroll and started receiving more money while

181
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:03.570
doing this.

182
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.530
Then she was as a chief of staff for a sitting congressional official and also

183
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:12.120
her husband's lawnmowing company starting to receive money as well. Um,

184
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.980
and he still refuses to endorse her.

185
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.210
So we realized something very shady and sketchy was going on. Uh,

186
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:22.500
and nobody still knew what the incident was that led to her being fired.

187
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.200
And so this is who we're running against somebody who's made up their entire

188
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:29.310
life story, everything about themselves. And it's just, it's insane.

189
00:10:29.311 --> 00:10:31.500
And nobody has ever looked into it.

190
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.853
<v 0>Well, you know,</v>

191
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.930
unfortunately a lot of local journalism has withered and died.

192
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.150
And so not that many people are digging in.

193
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.950
<v 1>Documents. They have it. They've just refused to actually look into it.</v>

194
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.190
<v 0>Yeah. It's, it's a tough time for, uh,</v>

195
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.740
congressional candidates who are trying to get a spotlight. I've,

196
00:10:51.741 --> 00:10:56.090
I've seen this with some of the humanity forward candidates, including you.

197
00:10:56.091 --> 00:10:57.170
And this is a,

198
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.360
a Republican leaning district that seems like it could flip. It's interesting.

199
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.920
Cause Ted's been there for a while. Um, his, uh, you know, your opponent,

200
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.480
um, I think many people just assume that she'd just sort of sleep walk into the

201
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:15.170
seat, uh, even though, as soon as you start scrutinizing it, any degree,

202
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:18.140
you're like, wait a minute, this person is like,

203
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.110
why is this price at like the brevity of favorite,

204
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:24.620
the Republican nominee to be a member of Congress. Uh,

205
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.190
and you are, uh, you know, to me like right on time,

206
00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:31.640
like if you can get the support and visibility you need, uh,

207
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.410
you would be such a fun, transformative figure in Congress. Uh,

208
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.850
we would have, it would be fun. Well, we see the,

209
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.520
I mean we see eye to eye on many issues. Um,

210
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.850
one of the things that I'm passionate about right now is championing casually

211
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.210
during this pandemic, uh, in universal basic income, longer term,

212
00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:54.460
but first things first, just cash relief. Like where are you on, um,

213
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.750
trying to get money into the hands of people after we get you into Congress,

214
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.100
January, 2021?

215
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.060
<v 1>Well, I, I think I've tweeted about this quite a few times,</v>

216
00:12:03.061 --> 00:12:06.330
but my first response is basically any stimulus baggage that anybody wants to

217
00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:06.691
put out.

218
00:12:06.691 --> 00:12:11.580
If it doesn't have cash relief at like a thousand or $2,000 for people

219
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.880
that it should be dead on arrival, it shouldn't even be taken seriously.

220
00:12:14.881 --> 00:12:18.360
And it should honestly be retroactive based on how much we should have been

221
00:12:18.361 --> 00:12:21.780
getting for the last seven, eight months. And so for me,

222
00:12:21.781 --> 00:12:24.570
unless it has those provisions, I'm sorry,

223
00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:26.850
but there's literally no reason to vote for it.

224
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:27.511
<v 0>Well,</v>

225
00:12:27.511 --> 00:12:32.400
hopefully we can get some energy and resources your direction to save

226
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:36.180
us from your opponent as, as a member of Congress. Uh,

227
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.560
and you as a member of Congress would, would be a blast. Uh,

228
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.950
where would people go to get behind you to support you,

229
00:12:43.951 --> 00:12:45.810
to find out more about you and your campaign?

230
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.760
<v 1>Biggest place obviously is our website, which would be for the many,</v>

231
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.990
not just me.com. Um, and that would be the best place.

232
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.460
Our Twitter and social media is AC for Congress, 2020. Uh,

233
00:12:59.461 --> 00:13:02.370
we also have an email list and different things, but, you know,

234
00:13:02.371 --> 00:13:04.530
we just dropped a jobs plan, uh,

235
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:07.830
that would essentially bring about 9,000 jobs to our district.

236
00:13:07.831 --> 00:13:09.660
And it takes all of our big ideas,

237
00:13:09.661 --> 00:13:14.130
like high speed rail and broadband internet and all of these different,

238
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.960
like small business incubators,

239
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.190
and actually makes it for our area because we have these big ideas.

240
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:24.270
But if we're not able to actually create a vision that people can get behind and

241
00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:25.980
actually see it in their daily lives,

242
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.270
then we're not doing anything that's going to be actually substantial.

243
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.020
And so that was a big thing for us is we created this there's even that we even

244
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.590
created a map where you could scroll in and see different locations and

245
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:41.370
different things that would be happening in our district if we were to get into

246
00:13:41.371 --> 00:13:43.950
elected to office. And so for me, that's what I'm focused on.

247
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:45.960
I'm not focusing on a 24 hour news cycle.

248
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:49.230
Like what's the most ridiculous thing that you can make up and like try to get

249
00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:53.010
people to care about it's about people and it's about what we can actually

250
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:56.520
accomplish and, you know, make our lives better.

251
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.650
<v 0>Let's make our lives better. Amen, Adam. Amen. I'm so,</v>

252
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.200
so pumped for your race. So pumped for you to become, uh, uh,

253
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.290
the newest member of Congress out of Florida's third district. Uh, Adam,

254
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.050
thank you for taking on this challenge. Thank you for running. Uh,

255
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:17.190
it's been a joy to support you and your campaign. Uh, yeah,

256
00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:18.120
let's just keep fighting,

257
00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:21.540
keep fighting in the gap between you and your opponent is very, very wide.

258
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.290
<v 1>You know, we've had a lot of, honestly,</v>

259
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:28.230
most people don't have fun when they run congressional campaigns.

260
00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:31.080
Like they get to a point and they're just, you know, it's just not fun anymore.

261
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.040
And we have had so much fun literally the last two days,

262
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.450
because my birthday was two days ago,

263
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.270
literally the last two days have just been phenomenal and like,

264
00:14:39.271 --> 00:14:43.860
I have not stopped laughing pretty much for Eddie point of them. And it's just,

265
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.150
you gotta have fun.

266
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.600
You gotta love what you're doing and you have to actually care about people.

267
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.040
And if you're grounded in that, you're going to do okay. We'll be with.

268
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.280
<v 2>You every step of the way, Adam. I'm really excited for you and your race.</v>

269
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.810
Thank you so much.

270
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.900
