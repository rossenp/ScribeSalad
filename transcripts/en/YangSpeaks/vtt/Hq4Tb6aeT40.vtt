00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.661
<v 0>Reading her book.</v>

2
00:00:00.661 --> 00:00:05.490
It was very effecting how you were in high school when nine 11

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:07.620
happened. And you just like were like, Oh my gosh,

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.600
like the entire perception of Muslim Americans has been changed

5
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:16.290
by this event now certainly they're different in many respects. I mean,

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.640
everything is different,

7
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:22.290
but I will say that the closest analog I can think of to

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.180
the fact that now Asian Americans are perceived as responsible for the virus

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.740
was in your own experience as a Muslim American post nine 11.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.240
<v 1>[Inaudible]. Yeah, no, I, I, um, it's</v>

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.240
, it is devastating to watch as people who are doing nothing, but trying to protect themselves and their families from what we're all trying to protect ourselves. And our families from are now being hit with the added burden of discrimination, simply as a function of what they look like and, and where their families come from. And yeah, I remember being a junior in high school when nine 11 happened. And I, you know, 

12
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.240
I, I remember it was the beginning of the school year. Right. So, um,

13
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.240
 you're still excited about, about school starting and you're just getting into your groove. And for, for me, you know, it was the first time that I went from being 

14
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.240
a

15
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.240
 Brown guy with a funny name, to being a very particular kind of Brown guy with a very particular kind of funny name. And then all of a sudden, right. Everybody 

16
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.240
sorta knew all of the epithets. They knew all of the stereotypes, you know

17
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.240
, for our family in particular, my little brother who's eight years younger than I am. His name is 

18
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.073
[inaudible].

19
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.981
<v 0>Oh my gosh. Wait,</v>

20
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:36.650
if you were a junior in high school that makes you like 16 years old,

21
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:40.160
he's like eight. He was eight. Yeah. Yeah, no,

22
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.860
that would have been brutal, brutal. I'm sure.

23
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:44.270
At some point he even thought about like,

24
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.530
maybe I should like go by another name. Did he like adopted another nickname.

25
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.880
<v 1>To his credit? My parents asked them, they said, you know, you,</v>

26
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.060
you can go by Sam, we'll just start calling you Sam. He said, no,

27
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:55.790
my name is Osama. That's what you named me. And that's my name?

28
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:57.920
And I'm proud of it. I, you know, it was just, it was a,

29
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.270
it was a sort of a moment of just being like, you know, that's, uh,

30
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.000
it takes a lot for an eight year old. Who's getting bullied left and right.

31
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.670
My brother is also kind of like your brother. He's just one of those really,

32
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:11.750
really good, nice people and his response when he'd get bullied for his name.

33
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:12.860
And of course it's still happens.

34
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.050
Wasn't to lash out wasn't to hit back his response almost always was just this

35
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:22.250
like extremely, emotionally mature response, which was, you know,

36
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:25.730
when you say that it really hurts my feelings and it just diffuses everything,

37
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.860
right. People are just that when they hear that, they're like, Oh, I'm,

38
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.380
I'm sorry, man. Like, I didn't, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

39
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.460
And it's just so, I mean, emotionally mature beyond, beyond his years, he said,

40
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.980
you know, I'm not, I'm not ashamed of who I am and what my name is.

41
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:40.760
And I'm proud of my name it in Arabic. It means lion hearted. And you know,

42
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.640
in fact my parents, uh, my name, my full name is Abdullah man.

43
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:45.650
It's 11 letters long and nobody can say it.

44
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:49.700
So I became Abdul before I started preschool. Uh, because that was, you know,

45
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.630
1989 and Paula Abdul was a thing and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was a thing.

46
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.700
And then eight years later they had my little brother and they're like,

47
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:57.650
you know, we've got to give them an easier name. So let's just do,

48
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:00.190
Sam was on the front and on the back. And so like,

49
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.940
my parents are over two on boys' names. Um, but yeah, it was,

50
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.950
it went from all of a sudden being different to being a very particular kind of

51
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:09.610
different.

52
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.790
And you knew exactly what the stereotypes were going to be and how it was going

53
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.140
to hit you. And so, you know,

54
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.430
my heart goes out to Asian American folks in our communities who have to bear

55
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.280
this, and I'm just deeply sorry. And I'll tell you this whenever.

56
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.590
And if ever I see it, I want to call it out.

57
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.860
And I think all of us should make that commitment to call it out because it's

58
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:29.470
wrong, it's dangerous and it's hurtful.

59
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.460
And it's something we need to always constantly be doing work to root out in our

60
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:34.294
societies.

61
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.840
<v 0>No. When I think about the people who are affected for whatever reason,</v>

62
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:42.780
I just keep thinking about this Chinese family.

63
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:46.620
I met in Iowa where they just ran like the local Chinese buffet.

64
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.990
And they were very, very sweet people.

65
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.590
And right now I'm sure every restaurant in that town is closed,

66
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.180
but I have this sinking feeling that even after restaurants reopen that,

67
00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:01.530
that family's business is going to be worse than it

68
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:06.030
was. And then that's going to play out across Chinatowns around the country,

69
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.660
around, uh, you know, those like ethnic food marts that I personally love.

70
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:13.440
Whenever I see like an Asian food market, you probably say way,

71
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:15.840
like probably like, what do you see? Like certain,

72
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.230
certain ethnic food markets we just run in and there's like, Ooh,

73
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.840
where did you get like four or five things from your childhood that remind you

74
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:23.090
of that effect? Like, I,

75
00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:28.020
I have this sinking feeling that all of those businesses are going to suffer

76
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.760
because people are just going to not want to go to that restaurant that

77
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.780
Chinatown, that community, that food market.

78
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.540
And I think it's going to persist.

79
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.850
Do you have any tips for folks who are like new to this?

80
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.600
<v 1>You know, I, um, you know, I think, I think certainly, um,</v>

81
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.900
people of color in our country have, have experienced this for a long time.

82
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:52.734
And also, you know,

83
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.790
it's important to call out that COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on

84
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.530
black Americans and native Americans.

85
00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:02.820
And so we're seeing structural racism play out, um, in a number of ways.

86
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.560
<v 0>Yeah. That's happening right in Michigan. Right.</v>

87
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:09.090
I think I just saw the stat where African-Americans are at 13% of the state of

88
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:10.800
Michigan, but 40% of the deaths so far.

89
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.230
<v 1>That's right. And so, you know, I don't know that,</v>

90
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.570
that I can share anything that other folks haven't already experienced or

91
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:18.090
thought through. But what I will say is, number one,

92
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.210
we all have a choice about where and how we spend our money.

93
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:26.070
And so if you've got an ethnic Rocher in your community who you think is going

94
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:29.010
to be in trouble because of the, I hate to say it,

95
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:31.860
the xenophobia and the discrimination, uh, in a community,

96
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.110
make sure you go spend your buck out there, right. That's,

97
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.920
that's a simple thing that all of us can do. Number two, I think, you know,

98
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:42.810
the impact of this is so much more disproportionate on young

99
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:47.400
people because it frames the way that they think about themselves.

100
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.360
And I think one of the most important things that we can do is make sure that

101
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:56.130
we're constantly empowering young people who face discrimination on a

102
00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:59.360
daily basis. And, um, reminding them that they're beautiful,

103
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.890
that they're meaningful,

104
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.000
that they matter that they have power and that we are proud of them, right.

105
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:09.050
Because that's where they get their own sense of their pride and their value and

106
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.510
their sense of belonging. And then number three,

107
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.070
that I am my life used to respond to a lot of this by, by hitting back.

108
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.870
And I found that just over time, that, that.

109
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.590
<v 0>Just so you know, I don't know people, I can see you Abdul right now,</v>

110
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.480
but a duel seems like a pugnacious type, uh, terms of like,

111
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.260
he, he like played football, I think, in high school and like, uh that's right.

112
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.280
Yeah. Generally like, certainly I can very easily see,

113
00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:36.430
like if someone gave you in high school, you'd be like, all right, let's see.

114
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.443
I hate to say.

115
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.950
<v 1>And it's sometimes my first reaction. Um, but it's never my best reaction.</v>

116
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.270
<v 0>Well, I think, I think part of it's just like where you are, you know,</v>

117
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:48.970
in terms of your maturation stage, like,

118
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.310
because I can imagine in high school you would just hit back immediately.

119
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.400
No college probably say the same, but I mean,

120
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:56.590
at this point you're like a dad,

121
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.780
like you been like the head of the department of health, the city of Detroit,

122
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.110
you, you pretty much have to learn to have a very thick skin. At some point.

123
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.090
<v 1>You start to appreciate is that people who engage in this form of behavior,</v>

124
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.520
oftentimes they do it because they've given themselves licensed to try and take

125
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:17.830
away your humanity. And I think, you know,

126
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:21.490
if I learned anything in my little brother, is that in that response,

127
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:25.660
when he would say, you know, that hurts my feelings, what he was doing was very,

128
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.160
very clearly asserting his humanity. People have feelings, right?

129
00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:33.010
And if you're able to, to look at somebody and say, you know what you said,

130
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:34.270
really hurt my feelings.

131
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.660
It forces a certain empathy because all of us have had our feelings hurt.

132
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.390
And I just think that there is a space to ask,

133
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:42.040
why are you saying what you're saying?

134
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.670
And how can I show you that what you're saying,

135
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.600
actually it defiles you just like it just like you think it defiles me.

136
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.220
And if we can grapple with forcing people to

137
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.900
come to terms with the mutual shared humanity

138
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.220
that all of us have in this moment, I think we're all the better for it. Right.

139
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:06.580
And then the other thing is one of the points that my mom used to always make is

140
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:11.080
that no, at some point you can only control you and you can ask yourself,

141
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:14.860
what did you do in that moment to bring out the best in someone?

142
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.490
And obviously when someone's being racist and discriminatory,

143
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.370
they're not their best. And you know, some would say, well, you know what?

144
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:23.920
I don't owe them anything. And that's true. You don't.

145
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.570
But I think there is always an opportunity to ask how do I bring my best in a

146
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:30.640
situation? And how do I pull out?

147
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.690
Even the shred of what's what's good in that person that's left. Like,

148
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:34.991
all right.

149
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:38.260
So I've got an opportunity to engage someone who's not being their best.

150
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.340
Can I bring my best to bring out their best? Because if you can do that, right,

151
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.270
that's the kind of person who truly changes things that constant ask.

152
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.870
It's a hard thing to do. And certainly if you don't, if you choose not to do it,

153
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.170
no harm, no foul. I don't blame you, but there is a real opportunity there.

154
00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:54.760
And that opportunity is worth taking, I think.
