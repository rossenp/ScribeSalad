3
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.720
When we were looking to give a million bucks away to the folks in the Bronx,

4
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:22.320
like I was like, we have to make it. So every dime goes to a human,

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.610
like I do not want to be like, again, not mad at nonprofits, like run one,

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.390
but we got to like find a thousand people and give them a thousand bucks. Um,

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.230
and we did it. I was very, very proud of that. We need more like that,

8
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.160
where we just got to get money into people's hands. And remember the Congress,

9
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.770
this is the only silver lining can we're in a deep dark hole.

10
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:42.360
It's a terrible catastrophic time,

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.420
but there's a huge appetite to do something differently. Again,

12
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.820
74% of Americans want cash relief.

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.540
Like we're going to get president Biden and then we're going to need a new,

14
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:52.351
new deal.

15
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:56.130
And it's going to be hopefully a chance to write some of the wrongs that have

16
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:58.710
been weighing our country down for generations.

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.370
Welcome back to yang speaks this week.

18
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.840
I sit down with Karen Hunter whose radio show I visited when I was running for

19
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.320
president. Really enjoyed this conversation. Hope you do too.

20
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.620
<v 1>We got Andrew Yang about to come in to talk with us.</v>

21
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.840
Maybe he'll be mayor of New York one day. I don't know,

22
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.920
but he's here today to talk about basic income and a host of other things that

23
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:43.400
he's working on. Let me welcome back to the show, our pal,

24
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.770
Mr. Andrew Yang. Uh.

25
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.640
<v 0>Hello, Karen. Thank you for having me. Uh,</v>

26
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.940
it's great to be here again. I feel like I'm coming home.

27
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.060
<v 1>Hey, you know what? Um,</v>

28
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.510
that just gave me chills and made me feel really good inside.

29
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.690
Thank you for that. You are home. So you are, um,

30
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.760
I've had your ma you you've been on my mind, uh, since well,

31
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.190
since the last time you were on, but the,

32
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.570
the 11 mayors throughout the country who signed this letter about basic income,

33
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.290
and then we're seeing another stimulus possibly come down the pike.

34
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.010
And I was like,

35
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.480
if they had just done the basic income thing that Andrew Yang was running on,

36
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.850
maybe this wouldn't be such a horrific time to, to be here in this country.

37
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.650
<v 0>You're a hundred percent right, Karen,</v>

38
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.330
where unfortunately now we're in like this pandemic fueled a recession that

39
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:38.840
could become a depression and we need to get money into people's hands.

40
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.290
So I've been doing my best to both make that case to members of Congress.

41
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.820
There's an emergency cash relief bill that literally 74% of Americans

42
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.020
support does getting money into our hands. Uh, can you think of something else,

43
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:53.770
74% of Americans support at this point? Like what do you,

44
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.820
what do you have to do to try and get that higher?

45
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.000
A majority of Republicans and Democrats.

46
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.850
So let's talk some sense into our legislators and get economic

47
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.020
relief into our hands.

48
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:09.340
I wish it didn't have to be like in this tragic and devastating a time,

49
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.300
but it's overdue.

50
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.690
<v 1>Well, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter just announced that he's, uh,</v>

51
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.950
donating $3 million to those mayors. Uh,

52
00:03:18.951 --> 00:03:22.680
I think the mayor California Stockton has been doing it

53
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.690
successfully. So he was one of the, the leading ones, chocolate Lumumba,

54
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.630
Keisha Lance bottoms is a bunch of mayors all over there.

55
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.480
<v 0>Veronica, you know, a bunch of people. Um,</v>

56
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.280
I was on a panel with mayor Tubbs of Stockton, uh, last year.

57
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.950
And he said something to me. I probably, probably not supposed to share,

58
00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:44.100
but I'll share it because you know, whatever we're here. Um, but he said to me,

59
00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:46.230
after the panel, he said like, Andrew, you can say.

60
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.110
I could never get away with saying, okay. And,

61
00:03:51.111 --> 00:03:54.540
and what he meant by that was that like, I was just up there being like, look,

62
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:56.360
we have to value people, intrinsically have to get,

63
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.060
give everyone a basic income and the rest of it. And last year he was like,

64
00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:03.360
if a young black mayor were to say that, like people would be like,

65
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.410
what the heck are you talking about? He's like, but now it's not just him.

66
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.860
It's Keisha Lance bottoms. It's Ross, Baraka and new work.

67
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.840
It's mayors around the country.

68
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:16.440
And they're going to be many more because if you're a mayor and you see what's

69
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:19.380
happening in your community, you're going to say like, wait a minute.

70
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:20.820
Like we need to do things differently.

71
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.610
<v 1>So, so tell me what the disconnect is. And I've watched it around welfare.</v>

72
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.511
I've watched it.

73
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:31.800
There's like this notion in this country that if we give somebody something that

74
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:36.600
somehow it takes something away from me. And so it is a weird thing,

75
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.940
but I literally watched the government print money,

76
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.620
trillions of dollars and give it to people and no one had a problem with it.

77
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.130
And I'm like, Oh, so we could just print money and just give it to people.

78
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.830
<v 0>We could have been doing it the whole time. Karen,</v>

79
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.820
I asked the brutal truth and Martin Luther King saw this in the sixties.

80
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.130
He was like, we should have a basic income today.

81
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.940
And he was killed while he was making that case.

82
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.800
And somehow we've been brainwashed into this nonsense myth that like, Oh,

83
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:08.820
we don't have enough to go around. It's been nonsense for a long time.

84
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.270
And this pandemic has demonstrated to all of us when push came to shove,

85
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:13.200
like you just said,

86
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.580
did we just print $4 trillion for wall street when they needed a bailout? Yes.

87
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:21.150
Did we just print $4 trillion for big companies?

88
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:25.890
And to some extent ourselves, like during this pandemic, yes, we can do it.

89
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.510
We just need enough members of Congress to get on board with the fact that they

90
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:33.090
work for us. They don't work for Amazon.

91
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.810
They don't work for the giant companies that have been laughing their way,

92
00:05:36.811 --> 00:05:40.350
all the way to the bank for the last number of years and decades.

93
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.870
<v 2>When, when you were talking about universal, basic income is, you know,</v>

94
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:48.720
during the election cycle, et cetera. Um,

95
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.940
I was always wondering like,

96
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.630
were there other places that actually made it work?

97
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.640
And you've given a couple of examples,

98
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.580
like even I saw recently that you had tweeted about South Africa

99
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.340
is on it. It's on its way to,

100
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.730
to creating a floor for universal income. Right?

101
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.600
Talk about where the rest of the world he is on days.

102
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.890
Because I think it's such a foreign concept to so many, uh,

103
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.890
so many Americans that they think it's not possible. Right.

104
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.680
But there are precedents for this,

105
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.160
like literally in places throughout the world.

106
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.861
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:30.010
South Africa just announced that they're going to make it happen for everyone.

108
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.180
Uh, India is actually implementing a version of it, uh,

109
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.170
to tens hundreds of millions of people, Canada.

110
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:42.280
They did it like a full on UBI trial and an entire town for years.

111
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.960
And in that town, you saw better health, mental health, more people,

112
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:51.190
starting businesses, more people going back to school. It was beautiful.

113
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.310
And when they found that data, they were like, this is,

114
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.730
this is exactly what we should have been doing this entire time. Like,

115
00:06:57.731 --> 00:06:59.590
the data is like Indiana Jones, you know,

116
00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:01.780
like rate as the lost Ark where like the data was like,

117
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:06.550
it's a freaking warehouse or filing cabinet where people were

118
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.700
trying to keep it from public eye. But then when they found it, they were like,

119
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.280
Oh my gosh. Like, so they're like you said,

120
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.400
there are examples of this happening around the world.

121
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.500
And the most compelling example,

122
00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:19.720
I think tens of millions of Americans just experiences.

123
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:23.590
Like everyone got 1200 bucks and everyone liked it, loved it.

124
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.590
Like it didn't make anyone, all of a sudden being like, Oh,

125
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:29.440
like work is for like losers or something.

126
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.090
<v 2>It shut down because you gave its citizens their money back, right?</v>

127
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.130
Like government didn't stop because we gave citizens some of their money back.

128
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.930
<v 0>Right? Yeah. And it helped the economy greatly. It,</v>

129
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.280
it like reduce the poverty rate,

130
00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:52.660
but it also went back right into local businesses to groceries, to fuel,

131
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:54.040
to rent. Uh,

132
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.510
and we are the citizens and the re the stakeholders of the richest society in

133
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:01.780
the history of the world, like $22 trillion pre crisis,

134
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.080
we can a hundred percent afford this. Dr. King knew it in the sixties.

135
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:07.720
He was like, we can afford this. Now he was right.

136
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.360
Then it's even more true today than it was. Then.

137
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.170
<v 1>It's just so baffling that there's so much resistance.</v>

138
00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:16.660
And it's always around this notion of laziness,

139
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.690
this myth of laziness that will somehow, you know,

140
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.470
lull people into not getting up and pulling herself themselves up by their

141
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.813
bootstraps.

142
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.470
<v 0>When you go online, they're watching who's. They unfortunately,</v>

143
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:38.170
a lot of people and you know, here on yang speaks,

144
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:42.790
we're big fans of our data being ours and of data rights and have data privacy.

145
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.690
We started the data dividend project to fight for your data rights.

146
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.590
But in the meantime,

147
00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:51.880
what can you do so that when you go online internet service providers,

148
00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:55.830
aren't keeping track of that data and then selling it. So what you do about it,

149
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.180
incognito mode, unfortunately, doesn't work quite as well as you hope it would.

150
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.260
So what you can do is what a lot of companies do for their employees.

151
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.840
You can use a virtual private network.

152
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.700
Now the one that we recommend your yang speaks is express VPN.

166
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.370
<v 1>We're talking with two Andrews, Andrew McCaskill, of course, Andrew Yang.</v>

167
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.920
You also are out talking about police reform and cash

168
00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:20.810
relief. Talk a little bit about what, what it is. You're proposing Andrew Yang.

169
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.190
<v 0>On the police reform style side of things.</v>

170
00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.320
I looked at the data because I'm a data guy, Karen,

171
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.420
and the data is shocking where you're seeing cities around the

172
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:36.920
country pound over a billion dollars a year in civil suits for police misconduct

173
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.750
and brutality, uh,

174
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.560
and the legal standard to successfully Sue a police officer is very high.

175
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.640
So if you were seeing successful suits at over a billion dollars a year,

176
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.870
you know that the magnitude of the problem is multiple billions of dollars.

177
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.790
And this is literally bankrupting,

178
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:56.720
some towns where some cop does something reprehensible,

179
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.350
and then the entire police department gets. And now at this point,

180
00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:01.370
you have to look at it and say,

181
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:04.910
this is a rampant problem in is like many of the problems we're talking about

182
00:11:04.911 --> 00:11:06.260
has been in place for years.

183
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.010
And when I talked to a black lives matter activist about this,

184
00:11:10.011 --> 00:11:12.560
he actually hit the nail on the head. He said, look,

185
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.410
local DA's cannot control cops in their area,

186
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.350
because if you're the da in that area,

187
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:20.660
you literally rely upon law enforcement every day,

188
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:22.310
just to do your job and make cases.

189
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:24.620
And then for you to turn around and being like, Hey, bad cops,

190
00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:25.700
like we're going to bust you all.

191
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.920
But like the local da is like Kamala Harris case at the same thing,

192
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:33.320
she was like, you know, you can't expect the locals to do this.

193
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.750
So what I proposed, uh,

194
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.670
was that you need a federal department of justice commission that ideally be

195
00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:44.510
named after George Floyd, that all their mission was,

196
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:49.220
was to investigate issues around police misconduct. And if you're a local da,

197
00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:54.100
you would celebrate because finally it would be something off your plate.

198
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.820
And you know that there are issues, you know, there are bad cops in your area,

199
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.830
but you can't do much about it. And then you can just say,

200
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:02.110
look like give it to the feds. And then the feds come in. Like,

201
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.980
it's the only way that you would actually be able to address this issue,

202
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:08.770
in my opinion, around the country in a real way,

203
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:10.780
that would actually stand up over time.

204
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.710
<v 1>Unfortunately, the feds right now, uh, is a Trump administration fed.</v>

205
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.650
And so there's no appetite there to actually do this with this current

206
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:23.484
administration.

207
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:28.200
<v 0>We've never had a department of justice interested in justice. Yeah.</v>

208
00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:30.030
They might want to rename them themselves.

209
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.860
You go with like a new one that actually gets after the people's work.

210
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.380
There are a lot of other things that we should do. I mean,

211
00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:40.800
a lot of the things in the Democrats bill were spot on around banning choke

212
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.000
holds and getting data. Like one, one problem is that if you have a bad cop,

213
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.230
that cop can just go three counties over and all of a sudden get hired again.

214
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.570
Uh, and, um, you know, you,

215
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.170
it's a situation where you actually aren't even sure of the magnitude of the

216
00:12:55.171 --> 00:12:55.680
problem.

217
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.350
That's one reason I went looking for the data because police departments don't

218
00:12:58.351 --> 00:13:01.890
actually report how many people die in contact with police officers every year,

219
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.950
even though they're legally required to do so, which, you know,

220
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.000
it's a terrible problem.

221
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.050
If like no one even knows how bad the problem is like that that's a terrible,

222
00:13:10.051 --> 00:13:12.990
terrible sign in just about any, any environment.

223
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.870
So there is also so much work to do on this side. Karen,

224
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.930
certainly I think cash relief is part of this too. When I said that,

225
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.590
would George Floyd have been there? Um, in that situation,

226
00:13:22.591 --> 00:13:25.380
if everyone was getting one to $2,000 a month, you know,

227
00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:27.840
I think that there was some issue around like, you know,

228
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:30.720
him needing to pay for something. And like people suspected the currency,

229
00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:31.411
et cetera, et cetera.

230
00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:34.890
Like let's just get real money in everyone's hands and then make it so that

231
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:39.240
fewer people of color are having run-ins with, uh, police, uh, for, for like,

232
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.360
you know, like everyday interactions or issues.

233
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.880
<v 1>As you sit home now and watch,</v>

234
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:49.770
as we trip into November, you're no longer running.

235
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.900
I, you endorsed Joe Biden, but I don't think it's a cakewalk.

236
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.610
I don't think it's going to be a runaway.

237
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.500
I think it's going to be a very difficult victory.

238
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.280
And I actually am nervous about whether or not he could pull us out.

239
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.380
Have you been having conversations with him about the person he selects his

240
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:07.981
vice-president,

241
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:11.190
which I think is going to be probably the most important vice-presidential pick

242
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:16.110
in our history. What's going to be your role in a Biden administration.

243
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.090
Cause there should be one and,

244
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:23.370
and give us something to hold onto Andrew Yang in terms of what you see

245
00:14:23.371 --> 00:14:25.350
happening in November regarding this election.

246
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.720
<v 0>I talked to Joe last week, uh, and I'm really very,</v>

247
00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:34.890
very positive on his chances of becoming our next president. And I, again,

248
00:14:34.891 --> 00:14:38.460
I'm the numbers guy where, you know, the polls let us down in 2016,

249
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.900
but the polls are pretty freaking uniform this time around.

250
00:14:42.901 --> 00:14:45.120
And they're even more extreme than they were last time.

251
00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:48.750
I think Hillary had a point in like the, like, uh, maybe a four point lead,

252
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.090
like Joe's lead is something like twice that,

253
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:56.030
and the lead holds up in places like Florida and Michigan,

254
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.390
like according to the polls, Texas is up for grabs. You know,

255
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.700
you got to look up and say like,

256
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:04.370
if you're the average American who voted for Donald Trump,

257
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.120
are you eager to sign up for four more years of this? You know, you're like,

258
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:12.680
you're seeing your economy shot to pieces. You're seeing people dying.

259
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.100
You're seeing him just like in, in flame, uh,

260
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.600
racial problems instead of trying to heal them. Like the,

261
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.300
even the average Trump voter has to look around and being like,

262
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:24.800
this is not good.

263
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.420
Like 72% of Americans said that this is the worst time in American history that

264
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:33.650
they can ever ever remember. Uh, so that's 72%, you know what I mean?

265
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:36.320
I don't know what the other 28% of people are. Maybe they're really old.

266
00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:40.730
And they remember something very, very, very awful. Uh,

267
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.150
but if 72% of Americans think you're in the worst time in American history and

268
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:47.120
their lifetimes, that's not like let's, re-elect like the current president,

269
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.420
like that's a very, very anti incumbent, uh, type atmosphere.

270
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:54.200
So I think Joe wins, uh, you know, but then after Joe wins,

271
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.040
the work begins. We have so much work to do.

272
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:02.330
We have to reinvent this economy so that it works for everyone listening to this

273
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:07.190
for families and towns that are being shattered right now. And I will,

274
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.940
uh, be part of the administration of Joe wants me to be, um,

275
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:15.560
one of the things that they have floated by me is to try and address our data

276
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:19.970
rights and, uh, technology issues, uh, things that the government frankly,

277
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:22.070
is way behind on. Uh,

278
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:26.840
and Joe has expressed some openness and enthusiasm for trying to build up

279
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.830
some kind of tech facing team. Uh, and I may be part of that team.

280
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.920
<v 2>As a, as it relates to that.</v>

281
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.600
When I think about how far as other parts of the world are in terms of

282
00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:41.050
protecting privacy individual, the privacy of individuals,

283
00:16:41.051 --> 00:16:45.790
particularly as it relates to our privacy from our tech providers

284
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.780
put into perspective what we,

285
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.420
what we sort of are giving the way without any modicum of regulation here

286
00:16:55.421 --> 00:16:59.560
or without legislators really understands technology.

287
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.630
<v 0>Yeah. We're giving away in dollar terms, hundreds of billions of dollars a year.</v>

288
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.130
Like if you look at Facebook and Google Facebook's revenue is 70 billion a year,

289
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.260
Google is 160 billion a year. Uh, that's almost a hundred percent advertising.

290
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.510
And so they're making all that money based on selling and reselling our data

291
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.770
to advertisers.

292
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:25.030
And we all had the experience where you leave Facebook and the ads follow you

293
00:17:25.031 --> 00:17:25.841
around. You know,

294
00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:29.320
you have some kind of Facebook conversation about a beach vacation,

295
00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:32.590
and all of a sudden like Aruba ads are being shown to you,

296
00:17:32.591 --> 00:17:36.610
like when you're on a totally different site. So, so that's, uh, so,

297
00:17:36.611 --> 00:17:39.850
so that's eerie and spooky. And number one is like,

298
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:40.930
we're not seeing a dime of that.

299
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.940
If our data's worth 200 billion a year plus like why are we not

300
00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:49.740
seeing a red cent? So that's messed up. Uh,

301
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:54.660
the fact that our preferences and opinions are subject to so much of this,

302
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.790
um, interference,

303
00:17:56.791 --> 00:18:01.380
some of it which may be corrupt or even foreign or, uh,

304
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.040
ideologically extreme, like that's a mess. Uh,

305
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:08.580
the fact that our mental health is actually diminishing particularly for young

306
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:11.280
people, particularly for young girls in part,

307
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:15.360
because of the way that social media incentives are set up where,

308
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:19.450
and I use social media a lot, you know, yang gang and all of that. But, uh, the,

309
00:18:19.451 --> 00:18:22.020
the fact is that if you're the social media company,

310
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.960
you get paid based upon trying to advertise to us.

311
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.730
And so everything you do is going to be designed to try and maximize engagement

312
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:33.660
and snap streaks and the rest of it. And so if you're a 14 year old girl and,

313
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.110
uh, you know, you're, you're getting cyber bullied or whatnot,

314
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.570
or being subject to various negative influences,

315
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:42.630
like there's no counterweight within that tech company, uh,

316
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.440
to try and look out for our kids. It's all about who, what the advertisers want,

317
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.640
like how they can make the most money. So it's bad for our, our, uh,

318
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.390
sense of self, our humanity, our pocket books and wallets,

319
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.600
our democracy and our mental health what's going on right now with our data.

320
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.370
And I would love to turn that around.

321
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:01.710
I'm working on things right now to try and turn that around.

322
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:04.860
But I think the Biden administration is going to move light years as fast.

323
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.690
<v 4>What do you do a fair bit of your life, ideally sleep?</v>

324
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.300
How do you do it on a mattress?

325
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.830
What do you need a mattress that you can sleep on?

326
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:32.870
And happily helix sleep offers just that it's a

327
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.990
high-end mattress and they send to you antibiotics.

328
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.190
You just busted out and then snuggle up on a pillow.

329
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:45.080
I think they drove a free pill and I do this action. Uh, and they've won awards.

330
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:50.270
They were like the overall mattress pick of 2019 and 2020 by GQ and

331
00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:52.400
wired magazine. So, you know,

332
00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:55.820
there was some wired editor to sleeping on these mattresses being like,

333
00:19:55.821 --> 00:19:58.050
this is the one, one, again,

334
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.070
they chose helix sleep and we to our fans just go to helix,

335
00:20:04.071 --> 00:20:07.760

but you can find out and they'll give you a 10 year warranty.

340
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.860
Can you try it out for a hundred nights?

00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:27.800
You can sleep on that mattress for three months,

the risk-free and I'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,

you can put in your partner's name, you can choose the side that you want.

349

That's firm or soft. If you sleep on your back, you sleep on your side.

355
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.270
<v 1>As I'm listening to you again, I'm lamenting man. You know,</v>

356
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.250
it would be nice. And if you live in New York, uh, as we, you know,

357
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.050
drew does from time to time, I'm wondering if you are going to throw your hat,

358
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.320
are you going to announce on this show today that you're going to be running for

359
00:21:46.321 --> 00:21:48.210
mayor of New York? I'm just curious.

360
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.220
<v 0>I love the question just in that, like, it's,</v>

361
00:21:53.221 --> 00:21:56.520
it's incredibly invigorating to be considered for it. Um,

362
00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.730
right now I'm focused on helping Joe win, get Trump out, like get,

363
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.330
get a new team in. Did he see? And then we'll look at, uh,

364
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.860
the opportunities for air for, you know, for me the,

365
00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:09.900
in terms of how to have a positive impact, but I love New York.

366
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.590
I certainly want to see New York back on its feet as soon as possible.

367
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.120
<v 1>And, and on that, you're a father, you're raising kids in New York. Uh,</v>

368
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.760
there's this drum beat from the president to St.

369
00:22:20.761 --> 00:22:23.910
Kids back into the classroom and or else,

370
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.300
or else funding will be withheld. What are your thoughts on that?

371
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.810
As somebody that also has children in the New York city school system.

372
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.800
<v 0>I have a con I have conversation with my wife about this on the regular,</v>

373
00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:37.200
as you know, we are all having within our households.

374
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.390
And there is real truth to the fact that like, there are,

375
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.660
you know, a million different situations around the country,

376
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.130
and there are real harms to not having your kids in school. Like, you know,

377
00:22:50.131 --> 00:22:53.610
like we, we all saw the beginnings of it with our kids being out in the spring.

378
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.100
Uh, and if you have that, uh,

379
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.800
at home time compound in the fall,

380
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.090
like some of these kids will be significantly behind, uh,

381
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.140
and their development will be, you know, less than what you want it to be.

382
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.590
Now that's one side of the equation. What is the other side, like,

383
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.570
how safe do people feel like if you send your kids into school, like,

384
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.390
are, are you confident really that, you know, in my case,

385
00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:23.460
like seven year olds are going to social distance from each other,

386
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:25.020
of course not their kids. Like, you know,

387
00:23:25.021 --> 00:23:28.740
like the odds of them all like wearing masks and staying like six feet away from

388
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.930
each other are approximately zero. So,

389
00:23:30.931 --> 00:23:35.880
so you have to look at that at the other side and say, okay, like, you know,

390
00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:40.170
what are the health concerns now? Where are the teachers on this? And I,

391
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.310
you know, you, you know,

392
00:23:41.311 --> 00:23:45.650
teachers are going to be obviously mixing with these kids on the, um, like, uh,

393
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.050
um, on the regular. Um,

394
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.490
and so th there are real massive issues to balance.

395
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.070
It's not like a black or white, or like, you know,

396
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.630
right or wrong thing in my mind,

397
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:59.930
because there are so many different situations for different kids,

398
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:01.490
different families, different communities.

399
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.110
If you're in a part of the country where frankly COVID is not rampant and like,

400
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:07.700
you know, your kids need school then like,

401
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.400
ideally your school does reopen in your kids back in that school.

402
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.580
If you're in a community where COVID is spreading,

403
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:17.630
like wildfire and hospitals don't have capacity, then it's a very,

404
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:19.520
very different picture. I'm happy to say,

405
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:22.730
it seems like New York now is edging towards like, uh,

406
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.520
being one of the clearer environments,

407
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:29.480
because we've taken it seriously because we had to pay such a tragic,

408
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.250
devastating price early on.

409
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:36.580
<v 1>Yeah. But it also, uh, there's no cure yet. And so,</v>

410
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.560
uh, you can be clear today and not tomorrow 14 days later,

411
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.970
uh, there could be another wave. So I just UN on that, you know,

412
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.460
th this president, um, took, uh,

413
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:53.140
took the opportunity to constantly refer to this virus as the China virus or the

414
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.150
flu and things like that. And as a man from the, with an Asian background,

415
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.090
what were your thoughts and what was he trying to do?

416
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.760
And what was the impact that the fallout from that?

417
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.910
<v 0>No, I was talking to a family member about this. Like,</v>

418
00:25:06.911 --> 00:25:11.380
Trump's like a basketball player who has like one move. And then like,

419
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.750
if you take the move away, he doesn't know what else to do.

420
00:25:13.751 --> 00:25:16.570
He just keeps going to it. So in his case, it's like,

421
00:25:16.571 --> 00:25:19.600
my move is racially inflammatory and divisive rhetoric.

422
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:24.100
And if I'm getting called the task for the fact that I've let this pandemic, uh,

423
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.690
run rampant and wreck the economy and kill tens of thousands Americans,

424
00:25:28.691 --> 00:25:32.230
maybe if I call it the China virus or cold flu, or like UConn flu or whatever,

425
00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:36.340
like I can like change the conversation and just like make it so that people are

426
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.930
angry at each other or distracted. Uh, so from my perspective, it was like,

427
00:25:40.931 --> 00:25:43.960
look, let's just focus on the real issues that we all care about,

428
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:45.640
which is our health, our family's health,

429
00:25:45.641 --> 00:25:50.470
whether our kids are gonna go back to school and like, keep the focus on, uh,

430
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.210
the fact that this administration has failed us in historic mammoth fashion.

431
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.690
Um, so clearly as an Asian American, obviously I think that that,

432
00:25:58.691 --> 00:26:03.160
that kind of stuff is nonsense and hateful and divisive.

433
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.550
Um, but I just don't want it to work. Like, you know, just to like,

434
00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:11.080
keep the focus on the president's performance and then we'll get him out of

435
00:26:11.081 --> 00:26:14.770
there. And then we can start to heal the country and do the hard work of digging

436
00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:15.604
ourselves out.

437
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.300
<v 1>It would be nice to ignore it, but there were people that were actually,</v>

438
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.530
you know, uh, abused attacks as a result of this. So.

439
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.060
<v 0>Friends too,</v>

440
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.560
I mean like the hatred and fear and hostility

441
00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:33.880
towards Asian Americans has surged to a level that, you know,

442
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.220
friends and family have never seen before. And like, you know,

443
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.680
kids being stabbed and like people being beaten,

444
00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:42.790
like an acid being thrown in someone's face randomly, like, you know, just real,

445
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.340
real, uh.

446
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.260
<v 4>Venom and hatred that has no place in America. Um,</v>

447
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.280
yeah, it, it, it, it's heartbreaking, you know, and like different, but the,

448
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.180
the thing I try and put back in perspective, it's like, well, I mean,

449
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:00.420
you also have, African-Americans dying of COVID at like three,

450
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:03.060
four or five times the rate of other Americans. I mean,

451
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:07.740
like we're all suffering in different ways. Um, and you know,

452
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.730
like to me,

453
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:12.870
like the goal has to be trying to do as much good as possible and get a sound

454
00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:13.031
and,

455
00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:16.680
and not let certainly president Trump distract us from what's most important.

456
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.010
It's the age old question.

457
00:27:28.011 --> 00:27:30.860
How do you find the people you're looking for when you're looking to hire for

458
00:27:30.861 --> 00:27:32.600
business? And on the flip side,

459
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.490
how do you find someone who's looking for someone just like you indeed is a

460
00:27:37.491 --> 00:27:42.290
great way for both employers and folks who are looking to take the next step,

461
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.890
uh, in terms of finding a job that's gonna pay the bills,

462
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.600
keep everyone's head above water.

463
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.110
So when Andrew and I were running a campaign,

464
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.250
we ended up having to hire hundreds of people.

465
00:27:55.251 --> 00:27:59.990
In the matter of two to three weeks. It was the most insane time of campaign.

466
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.480
I can't tell you how stressed the staff was.

467
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:07.160
And tech platforms like indeed were our saving grace,

468
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.200
where you're able to just find quick talent,

469
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.140
understand where they're coming from, where they are, their experience,

470
00:28:12.141 --> 00:28:14.390
their specific expertise,

471
00:28:14.391 --> 00:28:18.560
or identify their professional focuses and build to them very quickly.

472
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:22.850
Interview hire as fast as possible. So we are big fans of indeed.

473
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.980
And without platforms like this, I can't tell you how. And we were already,

474
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.620
we were already breaking things and moving as fast as we could.

475
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:32.690
I can't say how much messier would have been on the campaign.

476
00:28:32.691 --> 00:28:36.350
So if you're a small business or medium-sized business looking to hire and hire

477
00:28:36.351 --> 00:28:38.480
fast, indeed is the place to go for sure.

478
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.880
And you can get started with a three $75 credit for your first job codes to give

479
00:28:43.881 --> 00:28:46.880
it a try and get in front of quality candidates,

480
00:28:46.881 --> 00:28:49.640
go to indeed.com/yang. That's a

481
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.000
d.com/yang through September 30th,

482
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.380
75 bucks off your first job post to see whether it works for you and your

483
00:28:57.381 --> 00:28:58.214
business.

484
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:12.320
<v 1>So now what is, you know, I wait until November,</v>

485
00:29:12.321 --> 00:29:15.950
I just feel on some level, not helpless because, you know,

486
00:29:15.951 --> 00:29:17.240
as long as we have breath in our body,

487
00:29:17.241 --> 00:29:20.540
we can make a difference whether we're talking about our community in our,

488
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.600
in our own backyard, but it does feel like we're, we're,

489
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.600
it's a waiting game to November to see what happens,

490
00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:30.680
because as long as that man is in office pardoning for

491
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:35.320
guilty abusing the power, um, that,

492
00:29:35.321 --> 00:29:38.900
that he has been imbued with. And it's disgusting, you know,

493
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.920
as a student of history to watch this abuse,

494
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:46.210
that office in this manner, you know, uh, I just feel like we're,

495
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:49.030
we're in a holding pattern until November.

496
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.310
<v 0>Karen. There's so much for us to do between now and then, uh,</v>

497
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.810
certainly number one, um, uh, is some of these local races,

498
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.170
like I was excited for Jamaal Bowman. I'm excited for, uh,

499
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.560
some of the folks that my organization's endorsing right now.

500
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.500
We've got a primary tomorrow on Tuesday in Austin, Texas, uh,

501
00:30:07.501 --> 00:30:12.420
this great candidate, Donna, I M a is running that I endorsed. So like,

502
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.530
literally like every week,

503
00:30:13.531 --> 00:30:16.650
there's like another race that I'm like trying to pump, uh,

504
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:21.390
energy and resources and votes towards, uh, yeah, like the, uh,

505
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.240
there's another candidate who just came out as a mayor for universal basic

506
00:30:24.241 --> 00:30:27.810
income, Alex Morris in, um, uh, Massachusetts.

507
00:30:27.811 --> 00:30:31.740
Who's great freaking brilliant guys for your basic income. Um,

508
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.490
so if we can get some folks into DC, one of the things,

509
00:30:35.491 --> 00:30:40.080
so we started this conversation on emergency cash relief, which I'm clearly, uh,

510
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.700
a hundred percent behind. And to me, how can you be a member of Congress?

511
00:30:44.701 --> 00:30:48.240
Who's a Democrat and not be for cash relief, you know, like, like you're,

512
00:30:48.241 --> 00:30:52.080
you need to go. And we need to get someone in there who will actually say like,

513
00:30:52.081 --> 00:30:56.820
look during our pandemic, giving money to people is obvious. So right now,

514
00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.710
41, uh, representatives and like a smaller number of members of Congress,

515
00:31:01.711 --> 00:31:06.030
including Kamala Harris and Bernie and ed Markey support the cash relief bill.

516
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:10.530
And one of the ways we can get cash relief passed is by having members of

517
00:31:10.531 --> 00:31:14.340
Congress who are not for cash relief, have challengers come up and say,

518
00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:16.950
I'm for cash relief. Why the heck are you not for cash relief?

519
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.970
And then you either get the current member out and a new person in who's

520
00:31:20.971 --> 00:31:25.410
forecast relief, or you put pressure on the current person to switch.

521
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.080
Um, and so that to me is like,

522
00:31:28.081 --> 00:31:31.620
job one right now is we got to call our members of Congress and say, look,

523
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.290
you're going to pass another stimulus bill, which they will.

524
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.030
I guarantee you another stimulus bill bills coming.

525
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.860
You got to get more of it for the people, for us, for the humans.

526
00:31:40.861 --> 00:31:43.230
We do not care about the mega Corp's.

527
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.890
They can go into bankruptcy for all we care. Like I care about myself, my aunt,

528
00:31:46.891 --> 00:31:51.420
my friends, my neighbors get us the money. And so we need to make that case.

529
00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:55.170
And one great way to make that case is by like supporting people who are for it.

530
00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.390
And if you're not for it, you need to go. So, so that's immediate. Um,

531
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.530
another thing that we can do is, is, uh,

532
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.730
just lend a hand, like thanks to some people like Jack Dorsey,

533
00:32:08.731 --> 00:32:13.290
like my organization's given, uh, almost $7 million in direct economic relief,

534
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.100
including a million dollar straight to a thousand families in the Bronx, uh,

535
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:21.810
earlier, um, in the spring. I can't believe it's summer now. That's crazy.

536
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.060
Uh, so, so, uh,

537
00:32:24.061 --> 00:32:27.210
so we need to just lend a hand because there's so much suffering so many people

538
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.040
and we can't wait until, uh, DC gets its act together.

539
00:32:32.041 --> 00:32:36.000
Like we just gotta do everything we can to put people on a better path when

540
00:32:36.001 --> 00:32:40.130
we've been giving this $250 or 500, a thousand dollars to people,

541
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:42.470
Karen tears of joy, you know,

542
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:47.450
it's like it's incredibly invigorating and saddening at the same time that

543
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.880
there are so many Americans that if you gave them 500 bucks,

544
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:53.330
it would be like the difference between eating and not eating or being able to

545
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:54.890
feed their kids and not feed their kids.

546
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.880
So anything we can do to help on that side, we should do. Uh,

547
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:01.460
and for what it's worth, Andrew Yang is very positive.

548
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.490
How to participate in that. Oh, I would love that. Uh,

549
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:08.960
so our organization's website is move humanity forward.com. Uh,

550
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:12.950
we've given 7 million in direct economic relief, any money you give to us,

551
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:17.420
we're going to turn around and give to someone in need. Uh, and yeah,

552
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:21.230
hopefully we can get, get up to that $10 million level pretty quick. Um,

553
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:26.110
but the need is so vast. You can also request help out that website. Uh, so if,

554
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.180
when you're listening to this and you need a hand, you can put your name down.

555
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.050
It's pretty quick. Um, we do have a massive waiting list now. Um,

556
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.830
so no promises, but if you need help, please do just put your name down.

557
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.480
And if you can provide help, uh,

558
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.610
give what you can and we'll turn it around and give it to someone else.

559
00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.920
<v 4>It's the age old question.</v>

560
00:33:56.921 --> 00:33:59.800
How do you find the people you're looking for when you're looking to hire for

561
00:33:59.801 --> 00:34:01.540
business? And on the flip side,

562
00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:06.430
how do you find someone who's looking for someone just like you indeed is a

563
00:34:06.431 --> 00:34:11.200
great way for both employers and folks who are looking to take the next step,

564
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.830
uh, in terms of finding a job, that's going to pay the bills,

565
00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.540
keep everyone's head above water.

566
00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.050
So when Andrew and I were running the campaign,

567
00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.160
we ended up having to hire hundreds of people.

568
00:34:24.161 --> 00:34:29.140
In the matter of two to three weeks. It was the most insane time of campaign. I,

569
00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.420
I can't tell you how stressed the staff was.

570
00:34:31.930 --> 00:34:36.070
And tech platforms like indeed were our saving grace,

571
00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.140
where you're able to just find quick talent,

572
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.080
understand where they're coming from, where they are, their experience,

573
00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:43.330
their specific expertise,

574
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:47.500
or identify their professional focuses and filter them very quickly.

575
00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.790
Interview hire as fast as possible. So we are big fans of indeed.

576
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:56.920
And without platforms like this, I can't tell you how. And we were already,

577
00:34:56.921 --> 00:34:59.560
we were already breaking things and moving as fast as we could.

578
00:34:59.561 --> 00:35:01.630
I can't say how much messier would have been on the campaign.

579
00:35:01.631 --> 00:35:04.090
So if you're a small business or medium sized business,

580
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.420
looking to hire and hire fast, indeed is the place to go for sure.

581
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.790
And you can get started with a three $75 credit for your first job coach to give

582
00:35:12.791 --> 00:35:15.820
it a try and get in front of quality candidates,

583
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:18.580
go to indeed.com/yang. That's a

584
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.910
d.com/yang through September 30th,

585
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.080
seventy-five bucks off your first job post to see whether it works for you and

586
00:35:26.081 --> 00:35:26.914
your business.

587
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:38.220
<v 3>[Inaudible] curious what you think about.</v>

588
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.390
<v 2>Some of the large corporations that are now starting to,</v>

589
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.830
to pledge dollars to communities, particularly,

590
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:49.440
I'm thinking about the dollars place to the African-American community,

591
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.400
your racial or social justice, or even some of the organization,

592
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.510
some of the corporations they're pledging dollars for COVID, uh,

593
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.820
their COVID response. What,

594
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.020
what would you advise those organizations, those companies,

595
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.980
where to spend that money, how to actually make that money me,

596
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.810
or what should we be should be looking for asking for,

597
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.800
from those organizations that they're saying, we're going to give these dollars,

598
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:19.860
we're going to make these, these donations in these checks.

599
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.970
What should we be looking for or asking them to do with that money?

600
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.800
<v 0>I'm a huge fan of direct relief. Uh, you know,</v>

601
00:36:27.801 --> 00:36:31.940
like if the money was going straight into people's wallets and pocketbooks,

602
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.280
that would be ideal. I like it.

603
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.730
When firms stand up and try and do the right thing, they say like, Hey, look,

604
00:36:37.731 --> 00:36:40.220
I'm going to give $5 million to, uh,

605
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:43.160
communities of color I've been in those offices.

606
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.530
And you know what they do when they're in this situation,

607
00:36:45.531 --> 00:36:48.380
they look around and say, okay, who can we give the money to?

608
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.270
That will stand up to like a very,

609
00:36:50.271 --> 00:36:52.940
very high degree of corporate scrutiny or press scrutiny.

610
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.470
And then they'll try and identify various nonprofits that

611
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:01.670
are reputable and can be trusted.

612
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.910
And then maybe if you have 5 million to give to communities of color, you say,

613
00:37:04.911 --> 00:37:08.600
look, find me the five top nonprofits that are working on various issues.

614
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:11.540
And then you give them each a million. Each you have press releases.

615
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.690
Those leaders are happy. Great, love it.

616
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:19.370
How much of that money ends up reaching folks who are desperate right now for

617
00:37:19.371 --> 00:37:23.780
groceries and the rest of it? Probably not quite as much as you'd hope,

618
00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.680
you know, and, and, and not to be mad at anything that's going on. Like,

619
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.610
I've run a nonprofit that I started. You know, if you gave us a million bucks,

620
00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:35.060
like, uh, we'd be incredibly grateful. We do great stuff with it.

621
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.730
We'd pay our people first, obviously, because you know,

622
00:37:37.731 --> 00:37:41.870
like it's not like these nonprofits are swimming in resources necessarily all

623
00:37:41.871 --> 00:37:44.720
the time. So like some good work could be done,

624
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:48.410
but there'd be a lot of people that would never see a dime of that. Um,

625
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.380
and so it, it's a different type of challenge, but if you're a company,

626
00:37:51.381 --> 00:37:54.050
you feel like you gotta go to a name brand partner.

627
00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:59.600
<v 1>Uh, w do you run, I've been having this conversation just about every week, uh,</v>

628
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.150
because we know what you just said is true,

629
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.990
and we need to do more of what you're actually doing. Move, move,

630
00:38:05.991 --> 00:38:10.340
humanity forward, move humanity forward.com. So, Andrew,

631
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.570
first of all, thank you for being here today. Uh, we appreciate you.

632
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.230
We appreciate the partnership. You're a guy that really does care about people,

633
00:38:18.231 --> 00:38:22.010
and that's important to us here, uh, just in general,

634
00:38:22.011 --> 00:38:26.030
because everyone is so political. Everything's so political. Everything's about,

635
00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.800
you know, putting on the right face and,

636
00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.320
and saying the right things and having the right soundbites,

637
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.250
you actually do care. And that was what you ran for president on,

638
00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.930
and you're still it. So, uh, um,

639
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.310
I'm really grateful that you're part of this family here. I'll tell you.

640
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.370
<v 0>Karen, I'm grateful to you for having me on back when I was running. Now,</v>

641
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.360
I'll come back anytime and we just have to do what's right for us and our

642
00:38:48.361 --> 00:38:51.450
people. We know, like if you talk to the average person, like, you know,

643
00:38:51.451 --> 00:38:53.100
they know how to solve their own problems best.

644
00:38:53.101 --> 00:38:54.620
We just got to get money into your hands.

645
00:38:54.621 --> 00:38:56.820
So you can actually solve your own problems.

646
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.640
When we were looking to give a million bucks away to the folks in the Bronx,

647
00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:03.210
like I was like, we have to make it. So every dime goes to a human,

648
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:07.530
like I do not want to be like, again, not mad at nonprofits, like run one,

649
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.280
but we got to like find a thousand people and give them a thousand bucks. Um,

650
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:15.120
and we did it. I was very, very proud of that. We need more like that,

651
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:19.080
where we just gotta get money into people's hands. And remember the Congress,

652
00:39:19.081 --> 00:39:21.660
this is the only silver lining can we're in a deep dark hole.

653
00:39:21.661 --> 00:39:23.280
It's a terrible catastrophic time,

654
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.310
but there's a huge appetite to do something differently. Again,

655
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.740
74% of Americans want cash relief.

656
00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:32.460
Like we're going to get president Biden and then we're going to need a new,

657
00:39:32.461 --> 00:39:33.270
new deal.

658
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:37.050
And it's going to be hopefully a chance to write some of the wrongs that have

659
00:39:37.051 --> 00:39:38.100
been weighing our countries.

660
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.790
<v 1>For generations. Alexis have consequences, people,</v>

661
00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:45.270
you got to vote and you gotta take care of business. And Andrew Yang,

662
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.500
you come back anytime, sir. I appreciate you follow him, gang gang.

663
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.060
