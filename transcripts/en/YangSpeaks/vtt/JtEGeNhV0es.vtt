00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>So you, uh, become a musician. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.210
you have like an international trip. Um,

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.420
you have this arc that spans years. How did,

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.390
when was the first time you started realizing, wait a minute, like,

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.400
I'm not sure how fully I believe these things or that this is wrong or that

6
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.110
there is something, uh,

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.910
very dark and hateful that I may not want to continue to lead.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.760
W was there a particular moment or revelation or relationship?

9
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.970
<v 1>I think I had doubts from the time I was 14 years old and I guy came up to me in</v>

10
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:39.500
that alley every day until the day I left eight years later. Um, but you know,

11
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:43.820
there certainly were some moments that were kind of like trajectory changers.

12
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.440
Absolutely. Um, uh, 19 years old, I got married, uh, to, you know,

13
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.630
another girl, a girl who was 19 years old,

14
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:53.270
we had a child and then two years later we had another child.

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.010
So by the time I was 21,

16
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:59.960
I had two kids and I was a dad and a husband that helped change me because my

17
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:03.350
wife wasn't involved in the movement. And when I was home,

18
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:07.070
I didn't want to introduce my family to that. She knew, uh, and she, you know,

19
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.710
begrudgingly, you know, went along with it. Um,

20
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.320
but I also was a different person at home. Uh,

21
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.910
so I had kind of a replacement identity, community and purpose. Uh,

22
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:21.260
and that was a massive help. Um, also around 1995,

23
00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:23.540
just before I left the movement, um,

24
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.390
because I was trying to compromise with my wife at the time.

25
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.770
She didn't want me on the streets. I decided, uh, to open a record shop, um,

26
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.440
to try and make myself more legitimate. Uh,

27
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.180
but I was selling racist music that I was importing music that I was making. Uh,

28
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.170
and, um, but I was also selling hip hop and punk rock and, you know,

29
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.580
black metal and stuff like that. And it was called chaos records. Uh,

30
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:50.840
so it wasn't, it was pretty evident that we were intent on causing chaos. Um,

31
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.510
but the people I met there, they knew who, who I was.

32
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:57.080
They knew what I was selling. And they were, you know, customers who were, uh,

33
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.910
black or Brown or Jewish or gay. And they treated me like a human being. And,

34
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.380
and although it wasn't their responsibility to do that. And, and, uh, uh,

35
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.900
I'm very grateful that they did though. They sh you know, they,

36
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.110
they didn't have to do that. Um, that helped change me.

37
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:14.960
I received compassion from people I didn't even deserve it from,

38
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:18.860
and that was super powerful. You know, it was 75% of my revenue.

39
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.611
It was pre-internet.

40
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:23.060
So people were coming in from all over the country from Canada to buy.

41
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.510
And I was one of the only stores in America that was sewing, that kind of music.

42
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:27.344
So.

43
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.320
<v 0>75% Of your record store revenue was from the white power,</v>

44
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.910
racist music, like racist music. Wow. Myself, that,

45
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.910
that you had like a fairly normal record store. And then there were like some,

46
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.720
some people who were getting the stuff like on the, you know,

47
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.890
the fly on the side,

48
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:48.620
but it sounds like that was most of the revenue that's insane.

49
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.710
<v 1>Well, it was probably only 10% of my inventory.</v>

50
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:54.500
I didn't even keep it out in the, you know, in the shelves.

51
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:56.360
I kept all the regular stuff out into the shelves,

52
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:00.130
but still the racist music was seventy-five percent of my revenue,

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.080
even though it was only 10% of my inventory.

54
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.000
<v 0>Uh, yeah. So that was the business then. I mean,</v>

55
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.720
clearly it's not like a normal record store with like a, you know,

56
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.320
like a sideline. I mean, it was essentially, I hate music.

57
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.530
<v 1>No, it was, it was a hate music store. But then when I pulled that,</v>

58
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.350
cause like became embarrassed to sell it because of these new people I was

59
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:21.120
becoming friendly with. Uh,

60
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.210
I pulled that music and of course I had to close the store because I couldn't

61
00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:25.770
even keep the doors open anymore.

62
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.210
<v 0>Yeah. So that, that might've been the big decision. Then when you, like,</v>

63
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:33.060
if you make the decision to, to snuff out your business, I mean,

64
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:35.520
you have to know that's happening. Um.

65
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.330
<v 1>My wife also left me. She left me at that same time.</v>

66
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.140
I hit rock bottom is what happened. I just closed the store. My wife left me,

67
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:44.880
took the kids. Um,

68
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.770
and I used that opportunity in a very sneaky and cowardly way to

69
00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:53.130
walk away from the movement. I didn't denounce it. Uh, I didn't tell, you know,

70
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:55.770
I told my buddies I'll be back. I just need to go work on my life.

71
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.490
Be back in a few months, I was never planning on going back. Uh,

72
00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:04.170
it took me about five years before I kind of denounced it and faced my past

73
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.690
head-on I didn't, I didn't really start doing that until, you know,

74
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.230
1999 or 2000, because I was running from,

75
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.250
I was really trying to run from who I was as fast as I could, um,

76
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.710
until I realized it was killing me to do that.

77
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.350
<v 0>So, in your case, uh, you went to college, I want to say, um, is that right?</v>

78
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.490
<v 1>Correct. Yeah. Um, I left the movement 96,</v>

79
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:29.220
took me a couple of years to really figure out who I was.

80
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:33.690
I got kind of depressed. And then in 99, um, a friend of mine,

81
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.120
one of the few friends I had at the time, uh,

82
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.810
encouraged me to go apply for a job at IBM. And I thought she was crazy.

83
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.960
You know, here I was the sec skinhead full of tattoos. I hadn't,

84
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.870
I'd been kicked out of like six high schools, one of them twice.

85
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.660
I didn't go to college. I didn't even own a computer at the time.

86
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.200
Andrew she's like, yeah, go apply at IBM to, you know,

87
00:04:51.201 --> 00:04:53.550
a new position that they offered, like, okay, sure.

88
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.690
And I went in and it was an entry-level position. Uh, it was, uh, setting up,

89
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.060
um, and, uh, kind of re uh,

90
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.350
re-imaging all the computers that like a corporation would, uh, buy at once.

91
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.590
So it'd be like 400 computers and we'd spend a month, you know, setting that up.

92
00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:12.510
And my first job was to install all the hundreds of computers that my old

93
00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:13.344
high school,

94
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.550
the one I had gotten kicked out of twice and they offered me the job and I took

95
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:19.530
it. It was super entry level. Uh,

96
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.580
and I was terrified because even though they had no idea about my past,

97
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.410
the first day of my first job out of the movement was to go set up the

98
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.610
computers at my old high school.

99
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:33.390
And I thought I was going to get fired and they, you know, destroy my life. Um,

100
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.190
and I went, I was terrified and, uh, you know,

101
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.580
moral of the story, IBM eventually sent me to S to go to college.

102
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:46.320
But moral of the story was I met the man there that day on my

103
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:49.980
first day at work, who was the old security guard at my old high school,

104
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.680
black man who I, whose life I had made hell.

105
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.820
And he was the one who changed my trajectory. He's the one who, you know,

106
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.300
I didn't what to say to him when I came across him in the hallway. I said,

107
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:02.630
I'm sorry. Uh, his name's John Holmes. I said, I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes.

108
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.620
And he looked at me kind of scared because I had made his life hell when I had

109
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.800
gone to that school. And he said, you know, sorry, makes you feel good.

110
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:13.220
It doesn't do a whole lot for me. Uh, so I think, you know,

111
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:16.010
you need to repair the damage you've done. And he embraced me.

112
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.290
This was a man I'd heard a black guy who, you know,

113
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.150
in my heyday was I made his life hell. Uh, and he embraced me and he said,

114
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:26.390
I, you know, I believe in you. And, and I think you need to tell your story.

115
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:28.130
And that was in 1999.

116
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.900
And I started telling my story in roughly January of 2000,

117
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.050
20 years ago changed my life. You saved my life. I don't know.

118
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.210
<v 2>That I would have made it without him.</v>

119
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.120
<v 0>Well, I'd say extraordinarily compassionate of him, you know,</v>

120
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.140
like we all like to hope that we might react similarly to someone who tormented

121
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:51.790
us, but, um, most of us don't have that in us. I don't think. Um,

122
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.910
so you're at IBM at this role. And then they say, you know what?

123
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:58.990
You could use some, some studies. And so they ended up, um,

124
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.520
helping you go to DePaul. Is that right?

125
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.450
<v 1>Yeah. So I started out at this just like computer installer,</v>

126
00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:09.220
and then I worked my way up to an assistant researcher or assistant project

127
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:12.190
manager. And then I became an assistant researcher. And then, uh,

128
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.530
I got hired on to IBM. Full-time, uh,

129
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.020
started to lead a team in their SMB and our small,

130
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:21.400
medium business division when the internet was just picking up steam. Uh, and,

131
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.870
uh, through the work that I done had started like over 12 quarters, um,

132
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.740
like had developed leads that were like a quarter of a billion dollar.

133
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.670
So at that point, IBM was, was very happy with, with my work. I had, uh,

134
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.060
developed kind of this pioneering research team there, um,

135
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.850
in the sales department. So they were like, yeah, you know, we should really,

136
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.340
you need a degree. And I was like, yeah, I would agree with that.

137
00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:44.380
So I went and I got my degree as an adult, uh,

138
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.400
in international relations and international business. Uh, and, uh,

139
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:52.720
I spent almost, I think, seven years or almost eight years at IBM. Uh,

140
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.000
and I got my degree from DePaul during that time too.

141
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:56.110
And I'm really grateful for that.

142
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.960
<v 2>Wow. What an art.</v>

143
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.230
<v 0>Then. So that takes you through a particular period.</v>

144
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:06.580
And are you in touch with your, um, ex wife and kids at that time?

145
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.480
<v 2>Um, yeah, uh, yeah.</v>

146
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.120
<v 1>Yeah. I never lost touch with, with my ex-wife and my kids, you know,</v>

147
00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:15.370
it was difficult with my ex-wife when we went through the divorce,

148
00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:17.200
but I always wanted to be a good dad.

149
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.530
So I always always had the kids every weekend, you know,

150
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:22.420
Friday to Monday as they were growing up.

151
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:25.150
So I never lost that connection with them. And in fact,

152
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:29.470
they're 28 and 26 years old. They're not little boys anymore. Uh, and, uh,

153
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.910
yeah, so, um, they're doing great and they saved my life too. I mean,

154
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:37.270
it hadn't been for them to really challenge me and for me to have,

155
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:39.100
to be honest with them about who I was.

156
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.230
<v 2>Um, I don't know that I would've made it this far. So then.</v>

157
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.940
<v 0>In 2000 you started telling your story you're still working for IBM. Um,</v>

158
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.170
how did that transition look? No, eventually you wound up writing these books,

159
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.320
uh, starting these organizations in media, um, trying to get the word out.

160
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.260
Um, w w was that a, a big step I'm sure.

161
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.650
The first time you started telling people openly about your past,

162
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:06.180
that must have been very, very difficult.

163
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.670
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it really took, I told very, very few people,</v>

164
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.460
like from 2000 to 2003, it was, you know,

165
00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:16.400
I started to talk to family and people that I knew, my wife,

166
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.340
who I've been married to now for, for, you know,

167
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:23.360
15 years have known for almost 18 or 19 years, um,

168
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.780
who also worked at IBM at the time. It wasn't until 2003.

169
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:30.230
When I went to DePaul that I really started to tell my story. And then, uh,

170
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.800
in 2004, when my brother was murdered, uh,

171
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.080
that's when I really started to do the work that I'm doing now,

172
00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:40.040
when I started to focus on trying to help people disengage from hate groups,

173
00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:42.170
because I realized at that point that I hadn't,

174
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.860
that I could've been a better big brother to him. Uh,

175
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.360
and that now I could probably try and do that with other people that I didn't

176
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:54.680
know that also needed kind of a, you know, a guiding voice, so to speak.

177
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.890
<v 0>Well, we're certainly glad that you did, and you ended up writing a memoir, um,</v>

178
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.450
that that was published, uh, in multiple countries, uh,

179
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.210
and it'd become, uh, an incredible figure.

180
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.500
<v 3>Thank you. Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation.</v>
