WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>You have helped turn me on to several progressive congressional candidates</v>

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.740
around the country. It has kind of blown my mind,

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.660
how a little in the way of national resources is going

4
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.350
to, uh, many down-ballot candidates, uh,

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.920
around the country and districts that maybe they're not a slam dunk for

6
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:24.180
Democrats, but they should at least be competitive. Uh, and, uh,

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.210
and it feels like you and I are some of the only people supporting at least some

8
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:29.610
of these, these candidates, where are you?

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.920
<v 1>You and I differ though, is that you have an attitude of, wow,</v>

10
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:37.430
it really blows my mind. I have an attitude of how dare they,

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.950
because there's a reason for what you just said.

12
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:44.450
And that is the corporate democratic machinery that does as much to purge,

13
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.820
uh, uh, progressive voices on a congressional level, on a senatorial level,

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.830
as they do on a presidential level,

15
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.080
just like they did with the presidential race this time.

16
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:57.950
And they did with the presidential race last time in the democratic primaries.

17
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.100
And so the progressive candidates, and I agree with you,

18
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:02.450
there's some great people.

19
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.930
Many of them did not make it through their primaries men. Some of whom did,

20
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.000
but they are not given the support.

21
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.450
They often are not the people who already have their own resources.

22
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.050
They're not lawyers and business people necessarily, they might be scientists.

23
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.640
They might be teachers or whatever. And the,

24
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:23.240
the money from the democratic party is given to those that are what they

25
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:27.590
believe are the candidates, um, uh, who are more likely to win.

26
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:31.610
This is why our friend John Hickenlooper, who I certainly, he was a lovely man,

27
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.340
but this is why we have John who was, didn't even want to run.

28
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.790
We have him rather than the extraordinary Andrew Romanoff in Colorado.

29
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.680
It's why we had to Sara Gideon rather than, uh, uh, than Betsy sweet.

30
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.510
It's why we have, um, Amy McGrath instead of Broyer or Booker.

31
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:50.930
So it's, there's something dark there, you know,

32
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.150
and I believe it needs to be named.

33
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.760
And I believe that it's the wrong call for the democratic

34
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.540
party. I don't think that's where the people of the United States are.

35
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:06.140
And it's certainly not where the majority of Democrats are,

36
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.380
the majority of people in this country. And to want Medicare for all.

37
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.980
When you look at things such as cancellation of college loan debt,

38
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.140
when you look at things like universal health care,

39
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.010
when you look at things like free college tuition at state colleges and

40
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:23.420
universities, these are very popular ideas.

41
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.200
So why are we running a presidential campaign where apparently there's more

42
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:31.580
effort to, to lore Republicans than there is to please so many Democrats,

43
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:35.240
particularly progressive Democrats. I don't understand it.

44
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.680
I don't understand why there weren't more young people at the ETA convention

45
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.430
speaking. I don't know why there's not more reaching out.

46
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.380
I don't know why the burden is only on them to fall in line.

47
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.630
Some of whom I'm very frustrated with as well,

48
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:54.380
don't get me wrong because I do believe that the most important thing is to

49
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:56.090
remove the fascist from the white house.

50
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.120
But I also see on the part of the democratic party,

51
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.010
a pushing away of people who are voters,

52
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:06.220
or the very least potential voters. And that concerns me very much.

53
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.120
It didn't work in 16. And if they're not careful, it won't work in 2020.

54
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.620
<v 0>I'm with you on the frustration.</v>

55
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:17.910
And one of the things that I saw work out in the primaries is that if you are

56
00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:21.270
progressive running against an incumbent, um, there were very,

57
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:26.040
very few organizations or figures who will help you. Uh, and that's true,

58
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:28.470
even if let's say you were, um,

59
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.990
let's say you're a member of Congress and you were like a died in the world.

60
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:35.880
Progressive. It's very, very unseemly for you to endorse someone who's primary.

61
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.040
And one of your current colleagues like that. There,

62
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.630
there were some real rules against that in terms of decorum. And so if you are,

63
00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:46.560
let's call it a progressive Democrat running against an incumbent like there,

64
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.443
like it, it,

65
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.260
it staggered me how short the list is of folks who might conceivably get behind

66
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:55.560
you because the democratic establishment is not going to get behind you unless

67
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.140
the incumbent is mired in scandal.

68
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.520
<v 1>Yeah. But Andrew, it's more than, it's more than about incumbency.</v>

69
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.200
It's about more than incumbency.

70
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.800
It's about a viewpoint of the corporate centrist Democrat.

71
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.280
It's not just the incumbency. And when it comes to the incumbency issue,

72
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.960
there've been some real wins. Look at Cory Bush. She was able to defeat, uh,

73
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.280
a long time incumbent look at Jamaal Bowman who was able to defeat the longtime,

74
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.241
uh, incumbent.

75
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:25.200
And of course that whole trend was started with AOC who defeated the longterm

76
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.850
incumbent. Um,

77
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.330
so the race is on.

78
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.310
<v 0>Yeah, Cory Bush in particular, because it was in, in Missouri, uh,</v>

79
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.050
and her opponent, uh, I think his name was Lacey clay. Um,

80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.540
uh, like I hadn't screwed up in like any, any, uh,

81
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.290
mammoth fashion. I mean, I was excited for Cory's victory. Um,

82
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.190
but in Missouri you can see it more clearly in a place like AOC,

83
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.020
his district or Jamal Bowman's district. Um, but Missouri was an earthquake.

84
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.790
Uh, the, the problem is that it is so remarkable, frankly,

85
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.290
that you're like no way like an incumbent lost to, to their primary challenger.

86
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.410
I looked this up Marianne because, you know, I love math. Uh,

87
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.010
the incumbent reelection rate is 94%.

88
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.610
So if you are going to defeat an incumbent, you're,

89
00:05:17.611 --> 00:05:19.800
you're literally at least statistically looking at, you know,

90
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:22.770
like a sub 10% chance of victory.

91
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.470
And now having seen the dynamics play on these races,

92
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:29.790
I understand that more clearly because no one wants to help you, like, uh,

93
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.070
you know, except for frankly, someone like you,

94
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:36.060
someone like me sometimes like a very, very small handful of organizations,

95
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.220
because people are loath to antagonize the incumbent, uh,

96
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.330
and getting behind the upstart seems like a bad move, quote, unquote,

97
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:48.210
politically, even if you know that,

98
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.370
that person's in better step with the values of that district or with the

99
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:57.800
American people. Uh, and at this point it's almost,

100
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.210
it's not quite irrelevant,

101
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:01.970
but it's almost irrelevant if the majority of the people are for it.

102
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.710
<v 1>Exactly. And it's, and it's totally absurd and naive for us. Steven,</v>

103
00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:08.650
pretend that the political parties are, uh,

104
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.070
seeing as their first job facilitating the voices of the people.

105
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.140
They do more to manipulate into dictate, uh, then to facilitate, uh,

106
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.020
look at something like what's happening right now with black lives matter.

107
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.500
Black lives matter is the largest social movement that has ever existed in the

108
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:24.340
United States.

109
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.270
And how much of a difference has it made in any legislation whatsoever?

110
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.890
The voices of the people, this is what's wrong. The democracy itself is broken.

111
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.290
And as far as the incumbency is concerned,

112
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.510
it's a club and the club has many ways of protecting itself and

113
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:44.920
multilayers of resistance to any penetration and to any change.

114
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.780
<v 0>Now I'm a hundred percent sure</v>

115
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.580
that we need to actually fix the machinery of democracy in order for it to

116
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.120
represent the will of the people anymore. In part,

117
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.660
because of what you just described about cash relief. Uh, to me,

118
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:05.290
it's obscene that you don't have every single Democrat on board with a version

119
00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:08.920
of cash relief instead of the 50 or so that currently are on board.

120
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.600
<v 1>Thank you. It shouldn't include Joe. Shouldn't it include Joe Biden.</v>

121
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.500
<v 0>She should.</v>

122
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.970
<v 1>Include Joe and comma should. That's my point to you? That's my point.</v>

123
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.350
<v 0>So what we've done is we've actually tried to put pressure on individual members</v>

124
00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:30.790
of Congress, say, why aren't you for this bill?

125
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.360
And why aren't you for this bill? And we've managed to get a few more, not as,

126
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:35.410
not as many as I'd want.

127
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.390
<v 1>The reasons or excuses that people Democrats have given you for why they're not.</v>

128
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.620
<v 0>Well, uh, I'm like you in that,</v>

129
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:47.590
I think many of these members of Congress are just going to do whatever they

130
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:51.280
think is in their political self Pinterest. So if you say to me,

131
00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:52.450
why are they not on this bill?

132
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.790
It's because they think it's better for their political,

133
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:57.640
self-interest not to be on the bill. So then you say, well,

134
00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:00.820
how do you make it so that it's in your political self-interest to beyond the

135
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:05.410
bill. And one, one way to do it for me is for me to say, Hey, look,

136
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:08.080
the yang would like you a lot more. If you were in this bill, Oh,

137
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:10.930
and if you're not on this bill, then maybe we will support this person.

138
00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:13.160
Who's going to challenge you. Uh, and so,

139
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:17.380
so those are the kinds of conversations that we have actually been having.

140
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.500
And they haven't been as successful as we'd like,

141
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.940
because people right now do not see that it's in their political self-interest

142
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.820
to do what the American people see as obvious, because right now,

143
00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:31.360
75% of us think that there should be casually during the pandemic.

144
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.350
So once again,

145
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:35.800
why is it that you don't just do what everyone knows is common sense and the

146
00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:36.634
right thing to do?

147
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.660
<v 1>I don't know why you think it would make you unpopular to say to people we're</v>

148
00:08:40.661 --> 00:08:42.670
sending you money so you can survive.

149
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.810
<v 0>Exactly. Like how is this not a home.</v>

150
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.790
<v 1>And the same with Medicare for all though the same with so many of these issues.</v>

151
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.100
<v 0>So to me, I mean,</v>

152
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.010
there are so many problems stacked in here. Uh,

153
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.990
the main problem is that if you are a member of Congress with a 94% success rate

154
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.710
at being reelected, you just become this creature of,

155
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.490
um, of Washington. Um,

156
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.020
and you have these consultants around you whose careers depend upon your

157
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.940
continued membership in Congress. And so if someone comes and says, Hey,

158
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:23.160
like do this big thing, um,

159
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.810
that will to at least some people in your district make you seem, um,

160
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.530
like quote unquote, like radical or something along those lines,

161
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.300
they have like five people who are essentially like their brakes on any kind of

162
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:39.630
move like that being like, no, no, no. Like, uh, like don't,

163
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:42.960
don't embrace this thing. They're, they're like they have barnacles on them. Uh,

164
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.940
and the goal has to be that we actually make it so that they see that the water

165
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.340
is fine and that if they go this direction and it will help them.

166
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.870
<v 1>See, that's where you and I are. That's where you and I separate a little bit.</v>

167
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.700
It's called corruption, total and complete corruption.

168
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.000
Not only what you said about their constituents,

169
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.230
it's also about the leadership of the party. When Nancy says we're doing this,

170
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.490
no, we're not doing that.

171
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.790
And even the ones who would agree with us and are playing the long game.

172
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:11.930
So they go along.

173
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.880
That's exactly what I mean now until that's called

174
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.750
for what it is. And when you talk about all of the operatives, yeah.

175
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.790
They're their circus performers. It's, it's, uh,

176
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.600
that's why I call it a campaign. Industrial complex it's thicker,

177
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.340
darker and deeper than I feel we just were

178
00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:33.800
describing in this conversation.

179
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.090
And it has nothing to do with a government of buying for the people.

180
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.500
It's a government of by and for the corporate interests that are then

181
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.850
spending all the money in order to make sure some people win.

182
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.110
And some other people lose. It's not just the, uh, the, the consultants,

183
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.700
it's what the consultants are telling them. And so, uh, it, it, you know,

184
00:10:55.701 --> 00:10:59.450
I don't know why in Congress, unlike in every other profession,

185
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.020
we all have to make ethical decisions. You've, you've been in business.

186
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.470
You've you have a career where I'm sure you were called upon to make an ethical

187
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:09.560
decision. I might make more money if I make the unethical decision,

188
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.170
but I'm a human being who wants to respect myself.

189
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:13.730
So I'm going to make the ethical decision.

190
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.720
I don't know why we give Congress people a pass. Oh, well,

191
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:20.870
he or she can't vote the right way because they'd lose their job,

192
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.490
lose your seat, have some, have some conscience,

193
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.510
lose your seat. If it means, if doing the right thing means you lose your seat,

194
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.470
lose your seats.

195
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.390
And we need to say that and we need to call them on that.

196
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.550
And we need to get over our delusion that if we just vote

197
00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:45.260
blue, it'll all be fixed. I mean, if you look at the bailout,

198
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:49.100
if you look at the core, this bailout, which is so horrifying, the, as I said,

199
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.580
I call it the drop dead bailout. It's corporate bailout,

200
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.960
as opposed people bail out. Right. And I know you feel strongly about this.

201
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.520
Yeah. It's, it's really the same template as the bailout in 2008,

202
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.880
the bailout in 2008 was corporations versus people.

203
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.060
And they just took the same template and they went on steroids.

204
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.460
The whole system is that corrupt.

205
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.860
And yet the system mitigates against people calling it out on its corruption and

206
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.101
that's,

207
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.910
and that's why it's going to be an awakening of the American people who vote,

208
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.890
uh, in such, in such massive numbers for people who are calling it.

209
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.070
And what we have are so many people who recognize the corruption,

210
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.170
but who feel that their way of resisting is by not voting. Yeah.

211
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.370
Understandable. You have to give people something to vote for. That's the thing,

212
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:40.000
direct cash relief would be something people would vote for Medicare for all,

213
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.530
is other people would vote for college cancellation of call his own.

214
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:48.100
Do you know how many people would show up to vote for a presidential candidate?

215
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.150
Who said, I'm going to make your life easier? And I'm sorry,

216
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:55.870
it's not enough to just say, Oh, you'll this all of America.

217
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.210
How about some policies is going to make your life easier?

218
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.300
It's not enough to just say we're not Donald Trump.

219
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:06.060
