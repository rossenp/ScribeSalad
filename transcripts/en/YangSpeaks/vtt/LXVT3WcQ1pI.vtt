WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>You are someone who looks very much at the future of the media,</v>

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:06.870
how it can be solved also kind of working within CNN.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.093
What's that like?

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.821
<v 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:15.140
I certainly went through this media ringer and I appreciate you and crystal,

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.980
um, and folks like Joe and Sam Harris, uh,

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.120
and so many others breakfast club that had me on when I was

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.710
not as mainstream, I suppose, and just heard me out and, uh,

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.380
talked about my campaign, uh, now being on CNN,

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.940
like I have more insight into the goods and bads of how the media works.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.860
Uh, and I, I've been honest saying, look for me,

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.940
being on CNN,

13
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:48.800
I think is very positive because it helps just get my face and voice in front

14
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:49.880
of, uh,

15
00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:54.860
Americans in a way that can help advance our goals and ideas. Uh,

16
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:56.990
and I will say being on CNN,

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.640
I have never gotten any notes in terms of, Hey,

18
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.860
um, maybe you should try and make this point or feedback being like, Hey,

19
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.150
that point was not great, right. Or go down this direction.

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.490
So, uh, you know, on that level, um, it's quite positive,

21
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.800
but I also see that there are incentives wrapped up in the medium that ended

22
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.870
up driving coverage in particular ways.

23
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.850
And that the medium doesn't allow for particular types of conversations or

24
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:33.620
ideas to get out that might not fit into the rhythm of a

25
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.050
five minute cable news hit, uh,

26
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.130
that in those news hits comprise the vast majority of the coverage,

27
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.860
because the thought is that, well, if you're a TV audience,

28
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:46.250
like you need to keep things snappy and then kind of get in and out and maybe

29
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:51.100
have like graphic and video and some other stuff. Uh, so I,

30
00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:53.690
I let's just say that, you know,

31
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:58.430
being part of the media is just fueling my desire to try to,

32
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.880
uh, change the incentives in ways that'll make.

33
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.700
<v 0>It work better for more Americans.</v>

34
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.551
<v 1>Uh, and I,</v>

35
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:09.890
I say this in particular about the thousand plus local newspapers that went out

36
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:14.540
of business. So are there issues with cable news? Yes. Major issues.

37
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.190
Uh, but at least they exist. You know, if you have no local paper,

38
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:23.840
it's very hard to vote on what's going on in your town.

39
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.180
Uh, and so what's going on in media is a,

40
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:29.450
is a microcosm of what is going wrong in American life,

41
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.910
which is just the market runs everything.

42
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.600
And so if you're like post office doesn't make money, the post office, you know,

43
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:39.890
like, uh, that local paper didn't make money anymore. Get rid of it. It's like,

44
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:44.540
well, maybe that local paper actually had some value to the people at that town

45
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.730
beyond the fact that it made money as a private concern to

46
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:49.941
me,

47
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:54.170
we have to fix democracy and it's going to be difficult to fix democracy if you

48
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:59.090
don't have certain types of functioning media organizations and let's talk

49
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.100
the incentives there. Cause.

50
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.440
<v 0>I've, we've talked a lot here on my podcast.</v>

51
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.050
Just about the way that the media business is changing. You know,

52
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.420
you have first, you had to click ad revenue model.

53
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:11.770
Of course there was a monopoly on classified ads. Now that's gone with Facebook,

54
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.210
Google, and so much more.

55
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.450
I actually use a line all the time that you think you said on my show,

56
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.360
which is that the internet naturally sex selects from monopolies.

57
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:24.070
Like nobody wants to use the fourth worst Google the second best Facebook or

58
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:24.760
whatever.

59
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.320
But so if we're going to live within that system with realities and I've always

60
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.930
appreciated that you're fair, right. That, you know, people actually,

61
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.050
people don't really want to use multiple Facebooks or multiple Googles if we're

62
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:38.440
going to use, if we're going to live in that world, what do we do with media?

63
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.950
So because how do we actually make it? So,

64
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.720
cause you don't want government subsidized local news either. I mean that,

65
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:45.520
you know, we're talking about earmarks and pork.

66
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.820
<v 1>I actually do want, and this is where we disagree.</v>

67
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:50.040
I do want government subsidized, local news.

68
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.960
<v 0>Yeah. But how, how would you protect it? Um, how would you protect it from,</v>

69
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.050
you know, legislators who are using it as a bargaining chip?

70
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.080
Like if you look at what's happening right now with voice of America and the

71
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:04.980
global news agency, there've been all these accusations like, Oh,

72
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.930
Trump put in this person and you know,

73
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.750
even though this person who's been selected by Congress,

74
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:11.880
so if we were gonna fund it,

75
00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:15.600
like what are the ways that we could do it while keeping it independent with the

76
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:20.220
essential role that media has and then also protecting it from political

77
00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:21.540
influence? Is it even possible?

78
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.790
<v 1>I think it is possible.</v>

79
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:28.320
And I think that there are a few different parties that need to be part of it.

80
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.480
Uh, number one is government. Number two is, uh, nonprofits and NGOs.

81
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.330
And then number three are the media companies.

82
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.720
And I think there's a way you can fund it where let's say, hypothetically,

83
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:40.740
you said, guess what?

84
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.780
Getting quality information about what's going on in your community is a public

85
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:46.530
good.

86
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.080
And we're just going to say that there's a certain amount of money that gets

87
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:53.940
allocated for every concurrent congressional district based on population.

88
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.980
And there's going to be like a local paper that ends up being the beneficiary of

89
00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:03.630
this, or like a local station or whatever, like the local Oregon's are.

90
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.250
And it could be public private, uh, you know, it could even be in some cases,

91
00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:11.640
philanthropic, uh, but that there are different approaches.

92
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.770
These media organizations could a hundred percent exist if they weren't forced

93
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:20.820
to throw off market level profits every given quarter.

94
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.630
So what do I mean by that? It's like, look, my local paper can't compete,

95
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.020
but if you had a combination, public private,

96
00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:31.230
and you had a paper that made a certain amount of money and then spend that much

97
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:33.930
money on coverage and it broke even every year,

98
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.750
obviously no one would invest in that because you know,

99
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.190
it's a terrible business, but, uh, as the public would you invest in that?

100
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.020
Probably, I mean, you, you, you know,

101
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.690
you put it in place and then at least you don't have to.

102
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.810
And in my mind it would be worth the subsidy.

103
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.910
I have no problem with subsidizing, uh, local journalism.

104
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.670
And I also think soccer, this is a fundamental issue. Um, and,

105
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.130
and this is where I possibly, and I think I'm clear about is genuinely.

106
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.130
This is probably where you and I disagree. Well, conservatives look up and say,

107
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.580
Hey, you can have government involved with local media because it will become

108
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:12.170
politicized and a bargaining chip, and they might influence coverage, et cetera,

109
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.870
et cetera. And then I look at it and say, okay,

110
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.680
the current situation is literally zero.

111
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.540
Can you improve on zero? Uh,

112
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.260
and if you have issues around politicization and the rest of it,

113
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.940
you can look around the world and say, look,

114
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:33.200
are there independent media organizations that are publicly funded that seem

115
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:36.050
like they're okay, criticizing the government and you would find, yes,

116
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:37.340
they do exist. You know,

117
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:42.290
you could hold up the BBC as one potential example and say, that, is it perfect?

118
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:46.190
No, but does it exist? And a lot of people get value from it. And like,

119
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:50.840
does it seem fairly independent journalistically and able to critique

120
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.550
leaders? Yeah, sure. Uh, and so the, the,

121
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.030
the correct approach is not in my opinion, just throw up your hands and say,

122
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:02.180
can't do it. Like government's going to screw it up somehow and said,

123
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:04.040
you have to get into the weeds of it and say,

124
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.570
look like the current path is leading towards in this case,

125
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.530
total absence of local journalism, which I would argue is very disastrous for,

126
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.430
for democracy.

127
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.700
So then you have to just put your hard hat on and roll up your sleeves and say,

128
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:18.410
okay, what are the issues we're concerned about?

129
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.730
You don't want politicians to be able to yank funding every time that the news

130
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.970
organization says something nasty about them while then like, let's see,

131
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.570
we can make this funding mechanism independent, uh, of, uh,

132
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:33.620
of congresses wins. Maybe you have like very long timeframes,

133
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:38.420
or you can only make changes like X years in advance when like you'd like,

134
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:42.600
it might not matter to you anyway. Uh, so like that,

135
00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:46.640
that to me is like a more, uh, principled approach. Um, but,

136
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.860
and this is the tough truth as someone who,

137
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:52.490
and it's fun because I know some people like me because they think I have some

138
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:56.180
libertarian impulses and leanings and whatnot. Um, like I,

139
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:59.930
I am very conscious of the fact that there are a lot of things in my opinion,

140
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:03.320
government is terrible at, and you'd rather not have them involved with it,

141
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.690
but there,

142
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:08.720
there's also this tough truth that we're in an era where you're going to need

143
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:13.430
government at a minimum to inject resources into certain

144
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.950
types of institutions or to solve certain types of problems.

145
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:20.060
Because there's so many problems we have that the market will not have any

146
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:20.894
interest in solving.

147
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.140
<v 0>So I actually completely agree with you. And, you know,</v>

148
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:26.770
people who know me know that it's not about the government intervention

149
00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:29.110
necessarily, that I'm most concerned about.

150
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:33.520
It's actually that I'm not so sure that we don't have a private sector solution.

151
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.930
And the reason I say that is because I look at somebody like you,

152
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.580
who was born, like I said, with the Joe Rogan of the internet,

153
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.500
I see this burgeoning alternative media ecosystem. I see sub stack.

154
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.730
I see what's happening in Silicon Valley with tech and so much more the

155
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:55.770
explosion of new businesses and more, and I say, you know what,

156
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.070
there's something going on here. There's a realignment, so to speak, right?

157
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.370
You have changing business, changing media landscape,

158
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.320
changing business landscape.

159
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.200
You're changing political coalitions is like the craziest selection.

160
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:09.960
And along maybe crazier than the one before that.

161
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.960
So I kind of apply it as a framework towards any everything.

162
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.320
And that's what I mean when I say I look it at the media and I know you're

163
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:19.650
involved in the tech space as well. I see this explosion of sub stack.

164
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.860
I see this explosion of independent journalists guys, like Matt Taibbi,

165
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.640
Joe Rogan, going to Spotify, the emergence of this whole new culture.

166
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:28.530
And I'm like, what, what we,

167
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.180
what it's really up to up to is entrepreneurs and others is to find a way in

168
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:34.500
order to make that work for local news.

169
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:37.320
And if that actually cannot work and we truly cannot work,

170
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.290
I'm not above the public solution whatsoever.

171
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:43.730
It's more about jumping towards that a little bit too quickly.

172
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.700
<v 1>It, it, it can't work brother. No. Uh, the,</v>

173
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.140
the numbers guy has looked at it and said, this is a total disaster. And when,

174
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.910
when companies have invested tens of millions in it, you remember patch,

175
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.770
you know, like it, it was just sending money on fire. Um,

176
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.940
the local papers have all become, uh, you know, desiccated,

177
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:06.080
husks are disappeared.

178
00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:10.970
And I walked through those offices because I was campaigning in rural Iowa

179
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.380
and New Hampshire and elsewhere.

180
00:10:12.381 --> 00:10:15.440
And so you go interview with a local paper and yes,

181
00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:18.320
what that office looks like now, it's half empty. And, you know,

182
00:10:18.321 --> 00:10:22.610
people are looking around wondering if they're going to survive. Um,

183
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.660
and that's pre pandemic. I mean, post pandemic, this stuff's even worse,

184
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.561
you know,

185
00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:32.420
can you imagine being like a free weekly in Austin or Boston or wherever

186
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:33.920
trying to survive now? I mean,

187
00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:38.750
it doesn't make any sense like th th the I am, um,

188
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.240
I'm sure that there is no, uh, entrepreneurial market based solution, um,

189
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.680
for local journalism,

190
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.280
unless you were to have something like universal basic income where people had

191
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.560
their needs met, and then if they wanted to, they could write about stuff. Uh,

192
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.940
but even then you would have certain types of journalism that were not included

193
00:10:58.941 --> 00:10:59.780
in that, uh,

194
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.400
because like a local blog is not the same as having a

195
00:11:04.401 --> 00:11:08.540
genuine a news organization. Thank you for listening in.
