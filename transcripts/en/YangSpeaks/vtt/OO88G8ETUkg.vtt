1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:00.720
<v 0>Um,</v>

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.610
I don't think there's a version where Donald Trump wins slow

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.470
is there. Let's see let's review.

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.670
So there are three States that are going to count votes more slowly. Um,

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.600
and those three States are the States that you don't want them to be.

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.710
They are Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. So, uh,

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:20.910
so you can imagine.

8
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.850
<v 1>Hang on one sec, let's just, let me,</v>

9
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.030
let me do this for anybody who is listening, who doesn't understand,

10
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:29.570
doesn't follow politics. Doesn't know what the going on. Like there's like,

11
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.330
I want to play dumb, cause I used to be really dumb on this.

12
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:36.770
So just for context real quick, I want your there's so much noise out there.

13
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.480
Andrew. I hopefully break this down for you.

14
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.650
There's 538 total electoral college votes.

15
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.990
You need 270 votes to win and essentially a lot of them are already baked.

16
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.730
So there's really like 201 votes up for grabs. Um,

17
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.270
because 330, one of them are so already locked. Um,

18
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.680
so with that context, Andrew take away, um,

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
it didn't mean I meant to interrupt you, but, uh, but only because if there's,

20
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.090
um.

21
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.280
<v 0>The path is two 70. Yeah, completely. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.910
I was assuming that folks know that in Michigan, Pennsylvania,

23
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:14.840
Wisconsin are swing States or battleground States. Uh,

24
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:19.820
and so those three States not having their votes in on election night,

25
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.860
uh, will likely present a problem.

26
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.780
Like it's not a situation where you can pencil them in as blue or

27
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:31.490
red. Um, so if we're going to get a quick result on election night,

28
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.370
it's going to not involve those three States. Right? Uh,

29
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.260
it's very hard for me to imagine a scenario where Pennsylvania in particular is

30
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:42.380
just so clearly for one candidate that they call it.

31
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:45.740
Despite the fact that a lot of votes haven't been counted. Um, I like,

32
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:48.200
I don't see them calling Pennsylvania, uh,

33
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.790
or Michigan or Wisconsin for that matter.

34
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.350
There was one poll that came out that had Joe Biden up by 17 in

35
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:58.220
Wisconsin. So, so it's conceivable, that was constant.

36
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.270
Just goes so much for Joe that even with the mail-in vote, not, uh,

37
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.240
entirely counted that people are comfortable calling it. Um,

38
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.650
still something that I see as unlikely. So election night scenarios,

39
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.180
you have to contemplate them without knowing any of those three States, uh,

40
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.710
results. Uh, Joe has, uh,

41
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.210
an advantage in paths to two 70. He has a lot more paths to get there.

42
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.620
Trump needs to essentially win every state that he needs to win to get to two

43
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.440
72 70 is close to his ceiling.

44
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.720
There is a world where Joe Biden's ceiling is three 50,

45
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.810
like where he's just running by a mile. Um,

46
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.490
so the main scenario for Joe to become the clear

47
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:47.540
winner Tuesday night is if some of the big,

48
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.860
um, battleground States that are not those three go to him. Um,

49
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:56.210
so let's say Florida, North Carolina, if Florida and North Carolina go to Joe,

50
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.490
then he might be able to get to two 70,

51
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:01.180
even without any of the three slower States.

52
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.380
<v 1>There's seven States. I think that really matter.</v>

53
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.350
Uh it's you just said a bunch of them, but it's Michigan, Wisconsin,

54
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.270
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, that's, you're looking at,

55
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.450
and essentially Biden wins three of those it's over. Um,

56
00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:21.720
and if he wins Florida, it's pretty much over all in, right? If,

57
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.440
if he wins just Florida by the numbers that won't happen,

58
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:27.570
he'll probably want any one of the others, but if he wins Florida,

59
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.590
it's probably pretty much close to over. Um, Trump needs five.

60
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.370
So that's where the like Biden his favorite is because of basically that math.

61
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.790
These are all toss ups, leaning Joe in many cases. Um,

62
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.290
so I think the likely path and when near you agree with, like,

63
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:47.190
if you had to guess the likely path, if either of them win, um,

64
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.970
the likely path for Joe to win is that he takes Michigan, Wisconsin,

65
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.600
Arizona, and probably Pennsylvania.

66
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.150
Cause in all of those he's favored,

67
00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:02.100
he's got an 85 to 94% chance of winning

68
00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:06.600
all four of those, you know, individually. Um, and then Trump,

69
00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:10.050
if he wins, he basically has to win Florida, North Carolina, Ohio,

70
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:15.030
which he's winning in and then he'd have to take Pennsylvania and then one

71
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:18.570
of whatever's next either. And you could probably throw exactly.

72
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.890
<v 0>And so if so Florida North Carolina go to Joe, it's pretty much all she wrote.</v>

73
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.600
<v 1>Yeah. That's the key. Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.190
<v 0>So that comes in election night.</v>

75
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.110
Then we go to sleep knowing that Joe is going to be president and,

76
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.040
uh, the transition occurs hopefully pretty straightforwardly where if it's that

77
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:41.940
clean, it's going to be very hard for Donald Trump, not to concede. Um,

78
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.900
I know that some people in the Biden campaign are actually strategizing around

79
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:48.180
trying to get a quick knockout, uh,

80
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.770
by investing more heavily in Florida and North Carolina though,

81
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.810
they had beat campaign in Pennsylvania.

82
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:57.190
So they're then leaving nothing to chance that they're not,

83
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.290
they don't seem to be over emphasizing the timing of the thing.

84
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:03.270
They just want to win, which is the right approach. You know,

85
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.203
you're just going to win.

86
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.010
<v 1>So you've got so Florida, according to five 38, which I think is the,</v>

87
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.970
they were the closest essentially at least put in public press outlets because

88
00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:13.830
they aggregate all the polls and just do an algorithm.

89
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.630
They're the closest to predicting 2016.

90
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:19.260
They said Hillary had a 71% chance of winning where the rest of the press said

91
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.110
it was well into the high nineties. Um,

92
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.960
they were saying that biding has a 62% chance of winning Florida

93
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.610
and um, 64% chance of winning North Carolina. Those are tossups.

94
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.340
Those are, you know, it's roll the die. Um,

95
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.560
it's going to come down to turnout and possibly some shenanigans with,

96
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.570
uh, mail-in voting or COVID voting if you will.

97
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.420
Um, but that's where you agree. I mean, like we're saying,

98
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:50.490
that's where we focus and if Biden wins,

99
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.390
one of those it's great Florida in particular, we're going to have a,

100
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.490
Biden's gonna have a good night. We agree. Yeah.

101
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.730
<v 0>Uh, so that, that's where you should be, um,</v>

102
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.090
investing in paying attention, uh, certainly on election night. Um,

103
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.050
and you should not hold your breath waiting for Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,

104
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:13.700
or Michigan and not, don't worry about it.

105
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.420
Like the fact that those aren't going to be reported. Doesn't tell you that, uh,

106
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.260
Joe is going to win or not win. Um, there.

107
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.060
<v 1>It's not over either. Sorry to be clear, like if I lose North Carolina, Florida,</v>

108
00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:27.850
he's still got plenty of paths to victory. Sorry. Yeah.

109
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.770
<v 0>And that is a possibility.</v>

110
00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:34.240
Historically North Carolina has been tougher terrain for

111
00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:38.530
Democrats and, uh, Florida to slightly, uh,

112
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.890
I am very confident that Joe is going to win this thing. Uh,

113
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.470
I'm not sure if it's going to be Tuesday night reporting style. Uh,

114
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.770
but I'm very confident that he's going to win this thing if votes are counted

115
00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:54.250
and the process holds up. Uh, so there,

116
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.120
so the let's consider again, each of them in turn, there,

117
00:06:57.121 --> 00:06:58.450
there are a number of variables though.

118
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.970
Some of the variables extend beyond election night.

119
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:02.530
So I guess we'll just focusing on election night.

120
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:06.400
So you're right to look at the map, uh, as the election returns come in,

121
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.290
definitely it's going to be very exciting. Um,

122
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.010
but if these States start getting called for Joe, then that's enormous. Uh,

123
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.870
and there is a real chance that,

124
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:18.070
that there's a blue wave all around the country. I genuinely think that,

125
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.450
um,

126
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.400
in a time when 70 to 80% of Americans think that the worst time in

127
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.810
their lifetimes, that that's not like an incumbent type atmosphere, uh,

128
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.170
you know,

129
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.530
especially when this incumbent does not seem like the guy who's going to lead

130
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:36.760
you out your mind. So I think there's going to be a blue wave. I think, uh, the,

131
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.410
the democratic majority in the house is going to grow. Um,

132
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.060
the Senate's going to flip, um, there's going to be a unified government.

133
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.240
That's the way I think this is going to go as we're having this conversation,

134
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.500
like, you know, 75 million Americans have voted already. Uh,

135
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.290
and by the time people are hearing this on Monday,

136
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.260
it's going to be a significantly larger number.

137
00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:05.410
And then everyone's going to turn out on Tuesday. Uh, so you're,

138
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.570
I saw projections that said that this is, might be the highest turnout, uh,

139
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.550
in 60 years because of mail-in voting and early

140
00:08:15.551 --> 00:08:18.490
voting. I think we should keep mailing voting and early voting.

141
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:19.480
I think it works better.

142
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:24.070
I know who wants to just have everything be banking on everyone showing up at

143
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:24.904
the same time.

144
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.230
<v 1>One day, they're just throwing me off. Yeah. Agreed. We,</v>

145
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.640
so you have to imagine New York man. Right? So it's, there's a lot of them,

146
00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:35.710
so yeah. So.

147
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.600
<v 0>You have to imagine an incredibly high turnout environment and that's generally</v>

148
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:42.310
going to help Dems. Um,

149
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.020
so the size and enormity of the blue wave

150
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:52.030
and whether it crashes down in places like Texas and Alaska and

151
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.520
South Carolina, Georgia,

152
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.710
so interesting to me, uh,

153
00:08:57.711 --> 00:09:01.620
this really could redefine the American political landscape, uh,

154
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.950
for a long time. I mean, if Texas goes blue.

155
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.560
<v 1>Well that's easy Texas go it's it's over. Uh.</v>

156
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:13.550
<v 0>Oh yeah. That would be incredible. Uh that's I don't necessarily expect that.</v>

157
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:18.040
Sorry, Beto. I expect it to be very, very tight. Um, but I,

158
00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:22.940
I doubt it's going to get called for Joe, um, Tuesday night, but if it were to,

159
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.220
yeah, it's over, I'll just call it.

160
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.510
<v 1>Let's call it. Um, the, so let me ask you this,</v>

161
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:33.080
like what's going to happen is you're going to start having,

162
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.780
you're gonna have a with, you're gonna have these state States.

163
00:09:35.781 --> 00:09:39.170
I mentioned start reporting some results cause they're gonna be counting.

164
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.580
And I think turnout models gonna be all over the map. Right.

165
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:46.190
It's people are gonna be afraid to your point. I think you have record.

166
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.220
I think you have turned out like we've never seen before from people all and on

167
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:51.680
both sides. Yeah. I think Dems, maybe net benefit,

168
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:56.450
but Republicans get a lot of turn out too. If you start to see, like,

169
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.313
I,

170
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.040
I kind of want your perspective on how to help our listeners watch the results

171
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:04.220
come in on election night when they start to see Wisconsin numbers come in.

172
00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:07.550
When you know, they're going to take a couple of days to tally everything. Like,

173
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.400
do they, like, you know,

174
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:13.040
let's say it's 25% of results are in and they start announcing,

175
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.760
do you feel comfortable with that? Do you, uh, does that mean nothing?

176
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.530
Cause it's gonna flip on the next 75.

177
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.780
<v 0>It gets very frustrating. Zach has just depends upon where the 25% is from. Um,</v>

178
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.600
if it's 25% from an urban area in Wisconsin,

179
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.810
then you'd expect it to skew very heavily democratic. And then, uh,

180
00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:33.470
you take it with a massive grain of salt. If somehow they were to say to you,

181
00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:37.430
this 25% is a representative cross-section of the whole state. Uh,

182
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.350
then statistically you could say, all right,

183
00:10:39.351 --> 00:10:41.360
I guess we know what what's happening. Right.

184
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.690
That's one reason why they keep digging into which counties it's from,

185
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.230
because if you're an experienced political journalist, you know, which, uh,

186
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.970
which direction a County is supposed to go. Right? Um, the,

187
00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:56.180
the thing I look for is results that surprise,

188
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.880
that surprised the journalist involved, where there someplace.

189
00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:03.170
And they were like, well, I remember during the weekend,

190
00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:07.910
after super Tuesday where they were digging into what was happening in Ann

191
00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:10.220
Arbor, Michigan, uh, and they were like, Bernie,

192
00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:13.610
doesn't win this County by like a million votes or whatever, you know,

193
00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:15.890
then it's going to be a really rough night. Um,

194
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.520
so it's that kind of thing where if they can find an anomaly, um,

195
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:24.380
then that's a sign. Uh, but the, the raw vote totals, uh,

196
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.740
it's hard to tell because you don't know what counties are coming from.

197
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.900
