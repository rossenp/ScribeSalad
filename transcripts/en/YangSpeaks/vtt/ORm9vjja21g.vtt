00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.140
<v 0>So you,</v>

2
00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:05.490
you strike me as like a healthy well-adjusted

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:09.270
creative dad, like relationships. I feel like being a child,

4
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:12.420
actor breaks, you know,

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.980
X percentage of folks, um, you know, let,

6
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.720
let's call it 60% or whatever the number is like, you know, and,

7
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.840
and I'm sure you grew up with people that, um, went through a version of this.

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.190
Um, like I became a public figure relatively recently,

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.400
but I was already like a dad and like fairly, you know, uh, mature.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.510
So I actually now have a better understanding as to how it messes people up. Um,

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.570
and I think you became famous in the time before social media,

12
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:43.770
so good on you that you didn't have that particular.

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.540
Um, but, but would love to hear about your transitions that way,

14
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:51.350
like going back to school, how did you find Columbia? Cause I,

15
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.540
I went to law school there, so I know the environment somewhat and my,

16
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.160
my wife went there undergrad. Um, so, so, you know, it's like, uh,

17
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.370
so I get some of what that school is about,

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.760
but I'm curious about the transition both into college and then out of college

19
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.290
and, and coming back to Hollywood.

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.020
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, a big part of quitting for me and wanting to go to school was,</v>

21
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.280
was getting away from the kind of attention that you get

22
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.180
with quote unquote, fame, fame, something that I've thought about a lot,

23
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.170
because yeah, I've been on,

24
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:26.120
on TV and in movies and stuff ever since I was young. And, um,

25
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.950
there's an undeniably something very seductive and attractive about it.

26
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.700
Uh it's I think it's pretty deep seated in our biology and it makes sense if

27
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:38.930
you're out in the wild and you're living in a tribe of animals

28
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.270
and everyone in your tribe knows who you are and has some kind of emotional

29
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.660
attachment to you, you're probably more likely to survive. So that's attractive.

30
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.410
You want that.

31
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.210
And so I think we have just a basic animal attraction to that kind of

32
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.580
attention and fame, um.

33
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.160
<v 0>To verify what you just said.</v>

34
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.220
I remember I was reading something where it said that if you have primates in

35
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.054
captivity,

36
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.890
they'll actually pay food to see pictures of higher status primates.

37
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.650
<v 1>Wow. I've not heard that. That's incredible. I want to see that study.</v>

38
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.083
Geez.

39
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.730
<v 0>Because there was a time when you look up and you're like, Oh,</v>

40
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:21.320
celebrity culture, like, you know, um, like, uh, not very,

41
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.290
uh, natural, but then when you see that study, you're like, Holy.

42
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.690
Apparently celebrity culture is like the most natural thing in the world.

43
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.700
Of course it's.

44
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.670
<v 1>Very, very natural, but let's, let's be honest, chimpanzees,</v>

45
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.490
rape and murder each other all day long. But in the world, you know,

46
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.100
there's a lot of things that are natural that we.

47
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.770
<v 0>Oh yeah. I'm not saying it's a good thing, but it is hardwired into us.</v>

48
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.660
<v 1>Is it's hardwired into us. And like,</v>

49
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.870
th there's a lot of those things that are hardwired into us, that part of what,

50
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.910
like being a human is about is figuring out like,

51
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.730
how much am I going to be swayed by this,

52
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.230
this primal monkey instinct to, you know,

53
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.010
to act on these urges and that yeah,

54
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.940
there is an urge to, to want to be famous and I've,

55
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.620
I've felt it I'm drawn to it. I, it's something I'd probably struggled with,

56
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.100
to be honest, like on a daily basis, how much does this matter to me?

57
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.610
How much should it sway my decisions, you know? And, uh,

58
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.630
how much can I be happy without it? Uh, it's it's, it's,

59
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.280
it sounds funny to say it's hard because it's a real privilege to have to have

60
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:25.570
it, but it'll mess people up quick. It really does mess people up. And, uh,

61
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:28.630
it it's, I w I'm not above saying, like,

62
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.640
it's probably messed me up to some degree.

63
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.830
I do my best to have it not messed me up too much.

64
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.060
I've seen it mess other people up way worse, um, for a lot of reasons.

65
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:41.860
And it's part of what is actually makes me really concerned about the way that

66
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:46.450
online culture is moving right now, which is just, and look,

67
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:51.100
there's something really wonderful about kind of democratizing

68
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.660
fame. I think that in a way that's great fame, like something like that,

69
00:03:55.661 --> 00:04:00.550
shouldn't be limited to just Hollywood and or other, like, you know,

70
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:04.540
super affluent metropolises throughout the world. It,

71
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.360
it should be like that.

72
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.850
I should be at more accessible to everybody.

73
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.170
And the internet allows for that accessibility,

74
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.560
but what it also does is it,

75
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.000
it brings those kinds of struggles and that kind of addiction

76
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.190
into kinda everyone's life. And,

77
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.050
uh, especially with, with younger people. I, I really cause I, I,

78
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.490
I was going through this when, when I was in junior high, uh,

79
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.390
not because of social media, but because I was in angels in the outfield,

80
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.800
I dealt with like the kind of self doubt and questions of like,

81
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.650
do people really like me for me, or do they like me because I was in this movie.

82
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:51.120
And how can I know if I'm really worth anything? Or if,

83
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:55.330
if it's all about these appearances and like, is, is there any media.

84
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.220
<v 0>All, am I stopped doing these appearances? Like give everyone like, you know,</v>

85
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.350
forget about me, turn on me, et cetera. Exactly.

86
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.490
<v 1>And so, and, and that was, that made junior high. Like it was,</v>

87
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.170
it made it extra written for me.

88
00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:10.140
And of course junior high is written for everybody for lots of reasons.

89
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:13.530
But I dunno, I, I am, I, when I see,

90
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.170
especially younger people

91
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.770
experiencing some of the same kind of addiction to fame and attention

92
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.090
that I think like people in Hollywood have experienced for generations.

93
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:31.200
Now it worries me a bit. It makes me feel like we shouldn't be worried,

94
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.130
you know? Yeah.

95
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.740
<v 0>Yeah. Like, you're you have teenage kids, like, you know,</v>

96
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:36.660
having like their entire high school class,

97
00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.400
like following them into their bedroom, like, you know,

98
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:40.620
on their smartphone or whatever. I mean, like, you know,

99
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.700
like that's a very intense experience that yeah.

100
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.700
<v 1>Self differently,</v>

101
00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.810
if you are a performance and there's no boundary there,

102
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:54.180
then like the most important thing in life, I think,

103
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:55.200
especially as a younger person,

104
00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:59.360
but it's something I still very much believe in as a dad.

105
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.360
Now you have to have your own,

106
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.710
like your own relationship with

107
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:07.544
yourself.

108
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.560
You have to have that space where you are you and you know who you are and

109
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:17.120
you are who you are because of your own preferences and your own

110
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:21.320
feelings and your own beliefs. And if that goes away,

111
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:22.340
because you're,

112
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.650
you're constantly offered opportunities to present a

113
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:31.790
performance version of yourself and get the dopamine hits that you get when

114
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:35.930
people, you know, hit the heart button and like you, or retweet you or whatever,

115
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.210
it, you it's,

116
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.620
it's easy to lose track of that core

117
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.610
relationship that you have with yourself. It's and it's,

118
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.160
you gotta spend time alone.

119
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.290
You have to spend time just going deep down into yourself

120
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.710
and ignoring what anybody says, because ultimately

121
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.020
as Kurt Cobain says, Oh, we are as all alone or all alone is all we are.

122
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.070
You ultimately, you're the only, you are the only one, everybody out,

123
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.470
no matter how close you get. And like, I feel deeply,

124
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:14.360
deeply close with like my family, but it's, there, there is no matter what,

125
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:19.160
there's a difference between that relationship you have inside your own

126
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.830
head and it's precious. And it's,

127
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.720
it's a part of what makes us human and it's loses will it's so

128
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:28.760
loses will, if you never spend any time on it,

129
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:33.260
if you spend all your time for others presenting yourself to others.

130
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.600
<v 0>Wow, man, that's really profound and deep and correct. Uh, you know, I mean,</v>

131
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.280
I've just, I mean, I've just gotten to like a glimpse of it myself. Uh,

132
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.420
I fear for what we're doing to a lot of these kids' brains, um,

133
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:47.740
and sense of self, uh,

134
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.050
because I certainly never felt that visible and on display when I was a

135
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:56.980
kid, you know, it's like, I was a shy bookworm and, you know, go home,

136
00:07:56.981 --> 00:08:01.600
close the door and read my fantasy novel or whatever. Yeah. It wasn't like.

137
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.120
<v 1>But that's important. I did that too. You asked like,</v>

138
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.800
how come I'm like not addicted to drugs or, or, you know, uh,

139
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.560
in jail or something like, unfortunately,

140
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:14.290
a certain number of kids who experienced fame are,

141
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:18.760
I think a lot of it is because I was encouraged and did have time to just like

142
00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:20.640
be by myself and read that fantasy novel and,

143
00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:23.560
and like just have that time with myself and not,

144
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.790
not just be always obsessed with what do other people think of me?

145
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:29.710
How can I present myself to more and more people?

146
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.200
And what should that presentation be? And, um,

147
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.760
it gets convoluted so much with art too. That's the other thing, I, I.

148
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.600
<v 0>That's a thing about art man. And like,</v>

149
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:41.440
I I've experienced something like this even. Um, so I'm trying to get universal,

150
00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:42.850
basic income across the finish line.

151
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.810
And one of the things that happened on the campaign trail and like did,

152
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.110
can relate to this, is that like people, uh,

153
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.470
people need a person to like pin it on, you know? So it's like,

154
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:56.970
if I want this thing to happen, then it's going to have to be me,

155
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.070
like making the case, talking to people saying, Hey, we should really do this.

156
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.720
And there's like, this continued projection outward, you know, that, that like,

157
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.280
that you have to do. And not to say, I'm like,

158
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.800
I'm not like an artist or creative in the same way. But like, I,

159
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:12.360
there are some parallels because like,

160
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:17.070
you have to continuously like project this energy out. Uh,

161
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.510
