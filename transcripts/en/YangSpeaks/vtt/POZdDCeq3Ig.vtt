00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>I think, you know, people like you,</v>

2
00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:06.210
who've got a big heart and a big brain and a good message and good values.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.250
We need you to have more attention, bigger platforms, the people who are the,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.710
the people who are really, I mean,

5
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:17.010
there are people in this world who are really just out for themselves or who

6
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:21.720
really just don't care or who actually just mean those people never shrink

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.300
from the opportunity to grab the microphone.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.540
And so therefore I think it's important for other people to have an equal and

9
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:28.374
fair shot.

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.780
<v 1>Well, for me, I'm just all about trying to get the job done.</v>

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.890
I accomplished the goal. I mean, for us, it's like let's eradicate poverty,

12
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.270
let's put money into people's hands,

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.280
let's make it so that people have the opportunity to be time-starved and not

14
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.330
just starving.

15
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.820
<v 0>And, and when you see those, you know, when you see those food lines,</v>

16
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.700
now we have food lines in America,

17
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:57.460
people in their cars because of the virus and the economic crash people are in,

18
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.260
in, in their cars for two hours,

19
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:04.370
three hours trying to drive up to food pantries and food banks to get a little

20
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:08.240
bit of food. That's not going to work. Uh,

21
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.470
and you have ideas that can, that can eliminate all that. And, uh, you know,

22
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.940
and so I do think as well,

23
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.780
I think people can also tell when you stop being mission first and you start

24
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:19.810
being me first, then the, the, the,

25
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.720
the air comes out of the balloon pretty quickly anyway. And so, you know,

26
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.360
I would just tell any of your critics or whatever, Hey, just, you know,

27
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.400
just wash me, keep me honest and see how it works out.

28
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.950
<v 1>Yeah. To me,</v>

29
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.510
we just need to get the job done and whatever tools come my way to get the job

30
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.160
done. Like, I'm all for, like,

31
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.720
if someone who's been bashing me at a particular

32
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.560
point in time, then like comes around later. I'm just like, cool. Let's do it.

33
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.930
<v 0>The same way. You know, w when I left the Obama white house under fire,</v>

34
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:55.730
you know, and been such a radical firebrand in my twenties and thirties,

35
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.440
uh, I was considered a, uh, a left wing radical in the Bay area.

36
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.910
Now you have to work hard to distinguish yourself in the Bay area as a left

37
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:09.110
winger, but I did it. And, um, and then after I, and my son was born and, um,

38
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.410
I started, you know, trying to figure out more constructive ways to, um,

39
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.390
to be a part of the local political community. I wind up, um, doing this,

40
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.900
uh, uh, green jobs Corps, uh, in Oakland,

41
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.440
getting kids off the street corners and trying to put up solar panels,

42
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.420
Nancy Pelosi finds out about it.

43
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.600
I went up going to DC to talk about the program, to all of her people.

44
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.970
We get George W. Bush to sign a bill called the green jobs act of 2007,

45
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.960
uh, which, um, replicated my program across the country,

46
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:41.530
through the department of labor. The next year I wrote a book about it.

47
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.820
A book became a bestseller suddenly, you know,

48
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.030
I'm in the Obama white house and, you know,

49
00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:51.350
working with an $80 billion budget, working with Joe Biden and, uh, you know,

50
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.470
a bunch of other people, Valerie Jarrett, uh, trying to get, you know,

51
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:59.470
the green part of the stimulus package to work and instantly the right says,

52
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:03.760
wait a minute, this guy's in the white house. It's like, you know, protester,

53
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:07.750
this guy who's like against the police and all this sort of stuff, you know,

54
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.580
instant firestorm.

55
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.340
And those days you couldn't be controversial and stay in the white house.

56
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.940
So I resigned, they didn't ask me to resign. I offered to resign. I resigned.

57
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.220
And, um, uh, and I took a lot of heat from conservatives here.

58
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:23.320
We are 10 years later, or, you know,

59
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.180
they're about some of those same people who had come after me so hard.

60
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.830
I work with all the time.
