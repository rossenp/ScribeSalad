1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>There was a period and it's been interesting to see the pendulum swing somewhat.</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.740
So Silicon Valley could do no wrong for a long time.

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.100
Where do you see is because they're just like, Oh, you're like the innovators,

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.920
you're the super value creators and you're rich as.

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.200
And you donate to my campaign. So let's just like,

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.930
leave you the heck alone and just sing your praises every chance we get. Uh,

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.550
and then that pendulum has swung because of, uh, like, uh,

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.390
Facebook screwing, some things up and, uh, and, and some other problems. Uh,

9
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:33.030
so now everyone's starting to turn on a turn towards them and be like,

10
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:34.980
wait a minute. Like, you know,

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.240
is this really been like cool that Amazon is, you know, like,

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.470
uh, so one of the things that I think Amazon did wrong there, you know,

13
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.150
a bunch of things, but like there's diapers.com where they just lost

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.140
money on diapers for a while, just like forced diapers.com to sell to them.

15
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.390
Like Amazon did that sort of thing.

16
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.090
<v 1>Just because I don't, I know about that story, correct me if I'm wrong.</v>

17
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.890
So they basically like diapers.com was a popular website.

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.120
They're selling lots of diapers, Amazon lowered their price. And below that,

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.740
to the point where they were losing money, just to put them out of business,

20
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.780
and then they raised their prices back up when they go on, they're not cool now.

21
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.920
<v 0>So they go out of business. It was like, they come to diapers.com and be like,</v>

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.310
Hey guys, you guys are awesome. How are we buying? And then diapers.com is like,

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.750
no. And then Amazon's like, Oh, we'll see about that.

24
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.570
So then they lowered prices to a point where diapers.com was like hemorrhaging

25
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:36.290
money. And then they were like, okay, I guess we will sell to you now.

26
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.060
And then it was on it's like, that's what I thought.

27
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:39.860
And then as soon as they buy them, then the prices go back up.

28
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.470
That's how that should be. Is that illegal? Um, that is illegal. Yes.

29
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.460
Uh, or it's illegal in the, in the sense that it's, uh,

30
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.390
anti-competitive behavior it's against the antitrust law. Um, so,

31
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.320
so that sort of thing has been coming out. Now, if something similar with,

32
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.250
and this was like, to me,

33
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.600
the biggest nonsense was when Mark Zuckerberg was asked, like, Hey,

34
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.831
um, the people,

35
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:06.080
the founders of Instagram are worried that if they didn't sell to you,

36
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:09.020
that you were going to try and, uh, uh,

37
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.170
put them out of business and now compete with them are going to destroy mode,

38
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:16.610
I think was the term destroy mode. And then Mark was like,

39
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.370
no, I never would have done that. And then like,

40
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:22.730
we all know it's like if Instagram had sold a to Facebook,

41
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:24.230
you would know there would have been a free kid,

42
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.400
like Instagram clone out like that. Uh, and so,

43
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:32.090
so this is officially, you know,

44
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:36.650
it violates anti-trust law to, to do certain anti-competitive things, uh,

45
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.490
like that. But the, the reality is like, of course, that, you know,

46
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:42.140
if you're in that industry,

47
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.860
like you're going to do everything you can to try and crush anyone who could

48
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:50.510
potentially end up taking your business. I think you have to assume.

49
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.710
<v 1>There's a lot of that going on. We don't know of with, I mean,</v>

50
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:57.710
any company that gets to be that big, you're looking at the Microsofts.

51
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.450
You're looking at the Amazon, you're looking at the Facebooks. I mean,

52
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.430
you can't, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

53
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.500
can you get to be that big of a company without antitrust

54
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.593
violations.

55
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.250
<v 0>Antica, without some competitive behavior, it would be difficult.</v>

56
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.920
And the thing that most people don't realize now,

57
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.370
and this is one reason why I think universal basic income so vital among others

58
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.650
is that some of these companies have essentially just like left orbit in terms

59
00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:30.450
of business physics. Like you think, okay, like I'm a company I need to like,

60
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.020
you know, be efficient and treat my workers well, and like sell,

61
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.600
sell things that are profit. There's some companies that at this point,

62
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.740
I'm just like, like I'm worth a trillion dollars.

63
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:44.370
I don't even need to make money. Nothing matters. Like, what's that,

64
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:46.050
you're like a cool startup. Like,

65
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:50.290
I can buy you for $400 million and everyone's rich and I don't even care. Like,

66
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.690
they're just so

67
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.780
big that like that, that not like nothing applies.

68
00:03:57.781 --> 00:04:00.840
I think Tim O'Reilly called it like super money. It's like,

69
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:05.220
at some point you just get super money and then like nothing matters.

70
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.900
And then we still try and pretend.

71
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.990
And what was funny is when they got brought into Congress, like they pretend to,

72
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:12.730
it's like, Oh, we started into this crappy company. They're like, they, they,

73
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.970
they it's like freaking at this point,

74
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.400
they're almost like countries on to themselves.

75
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.340
They're just so staggeringly, enormously wealthy.

76
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:24.630
And they have now at this point,

77
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:28.860
their stock market valuations are propped up in so many ways that

78
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.970
they can almost do no wrong. Uh,

79
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.820
and in that environment,

80
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:38.930
they're just going to keep sucking up more and more value. Like the,

81
00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:41.130
the thing I kept saying to folks on the trail was like, look,

82
00:04:41.131 --> 00:04:44.220
Amazon is worth a trillion bucks, paid zero in taxes,

83
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.150
soaking up $20 billion a year in commerce, closing 30% of your stores and malls.

84
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:52.290
And that was pretty crisis. It's like, you know, these things like a black hole.

85
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.770
So let's just skip it, just suck more and more about value in,

86
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.900
and we're not going to see anything coming out. Um, and you think it's like, Oh,

87
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.750
it's because they're like out competing at some point they just left orbit.

88
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.020
And it, and the funny thing about Amazon is like,

89
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.970
there've been periods in his past where it didn't even make money,

90
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.400
but at this point you look at it and being like,

91
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.610
like there was a Walmart executive who complained to me, he said,

92
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:17.220
how can you compete against a company that doesn't even need to make money?

93
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.501
And this was Walmart,

94
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:24.030
which is sort of ironic because Walmart honestly like crushed every like mom and

95
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:26.520
pop retailer. And it's complaining.

96
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.230
<v 1>About Amazon. It's beautiful.</v>

97
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.020
<v 0>But yeah, like I joked with the Walmart folks. It's like,</v>

98
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:34.740
they were like the tanks that came to American communities around the country

99
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.430
just like ran over every mom and pop. And then there were like, we did it,

100
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:41.970
we conquered America. And then Amazon's like a spaceship,

101
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.000
like hovering over them. It's like,

102
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.890
we don't need to obey the laws of gravity anymore. It's like,

103
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.970
what do we do? And then you have our government over here. And like,

104
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.640
they're just like, you know, the government doesn't understand what is going on.

105
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.510
And just looking up being like, yeah, like Amazon's a company. Like any other

106
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.310
that that's like the [inaudible] yeah. They have their own. I mean,

107
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.560
if you look at what's going on with Amazon, like Jeff Bezos is so rich,

108
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.890
he bought the Washington post with essentially like pocket change from his

109
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:20.780
couch. Like, you know, like the Washington post is a very,

110
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.130
very influential publication.

111
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.630
That happens to be like the main news source in our nation's Capitol. Like,

112
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:28.880
do you think that, you know, literally, and,

113
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.810
and he has been relatively hands-off like he has, he doesn't go in and be like,

114
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.030
write about this, write about that. But it is,

115
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:39.860
it's telling it's that like Amazon up here, Jeff Bezos, like, you know,

116
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:42.290
a peer and then like, you know,

117
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.290
our nation's major media,

118
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.860
like news source for our legislators was like down here. And he was like, yeah,

119
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.210
like, sure. It's like,

120
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.920
it's like took a couple of hundred million out of the couch. It does. I mean,

121
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.470
he's worth at this point, hundreds of billions anyway. Sorry.

122
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.900
<v 1>That was fascinating. And I think it really it's terrifying.</v>

123
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:06.580
I think that analogy of it's like Walmart came in with the tanks and,

124
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.900
but they weren't thinking big enough.

125
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.010
And Amazon came in with the UFO spaceship and just zapped them.

126
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.570
<v 0>I kept thinking about the video games you play when you're like you keep</v>

127
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.113
grading and you replay.

128
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.370
<v 1>Again with all the upgrades. Yeah. Just way stronger. Every time.</v>

129
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.720
<v 0>Red big is one. I want to wrap this story because it's, to me,</v>

130
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:27.210
it was interesting. So the founder,

131
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.010
one of the founders of diapers.com was a guy named Mark lore.

132
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.810
So then Amazon crushes, diapers.com absorbs them. Mark.

133
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.660
Laura becomes rich, but he's mad at Amazon.

134
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.550
So he comes back for revenge years later and starts

135
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.480
jet.com raises. I think he raised like,

136
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.830
like $500 million,

137
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.130
a billion dollars being like we are going to out-compete Amazon.

138
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:55.870
And e-commerce like, he's like, I have found the way. And so

139
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.420
it's so he got all of these investors to pilot, the jet.com

140
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.960
and@jet.com was like spending. Do you remember jet.com

141
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.960
jet dot? Got they had, I think their color,

142
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.690
it was purple had like Jed that some smiling anyway.

143
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.370
So jet.com spends hundreds of millions trying to fight it out with Amazon and

144
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:23.260
e-commerce and then Walmart buys jet.com as a way

145
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:27.250
to try and make themselves competitive on Amazon in

146
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.840
e-commerce. So, so that's like the, how it all fit together. It's like Mark,

147
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.460
Laura came back for revenge and then ended up like getting absorbed by Walmart

148
00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:39.640
in a relatively few tile attempt to try and bring down the spaceship.

149
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.480
<v 1>So weird. Why? Ah, that's so funny.</v>

150
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.700
I guess it never happened. I mean, Walmart failed to, to make it competitive.

151
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:49.534
It sounds like.

152
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.500
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think it's worked out being like, sure. I'll that again?</v>

153
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.180
Dot com and Walmart had to do something.

154
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.280
<v 1>Let's see if jet.com is still no, it just,</v>

155
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.970
it literally redirected to walmart.com. Yeah.

156
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.090
<v 0>I think they paid a billion dollars for jet.com. Like if you could look,</v>

157
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.290
look up that that.

158
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.770
<v 1>Were they just thinking like, look, we can't deal with another one of these.</v>

159
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.600
Okay.

160
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.433
<v 0>I just want, it was,</v>

161
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.000
it was literally to try and bring on Marc lore to be like the Amazon killer.

162
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.920
Cause if there was like any human that represented the diapers guy.

163
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.600
Yeah. Like the David Day, I was like a lie. There was this guy, Mark lore.

164
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.160
And he had a chip on his shoulder because he was like, I'm back, uh,

165
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.540
back you, you destroyed my diapers.com a spaceship.

166
00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:43.940
And now we're back with like jet.com. And anyway,

167
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.950
I found that story really interesting in large

168
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.221
part,

169
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:53.450
because Mark was so compelling that he raised hundreds of millions of dollars,

170
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.650
uh, for an e-commerce company to try and rival Amazon.

171
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.740
And I thought that was like the most amazing act of salesmanship I had ever

172
00:10:00.741 --> 00:10:05.390
heard. I was like, wow, this guy must be the most convincing dude.

173
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.800
<v 1>Well, they all, they all got, they all made money. It sounds like by the,</v>

174
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.110
by the end of it, except Walmart.

175
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.260
<v 0>I think that's correct. Yeah. Yeah, that's correct.</v>

176
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.510
<v 1>But I think it really underlies this issue of how can we possibly govern</v>

177
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:25.790
in the face of such super money if our regulators and our

178
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:29.720
elected officials don't even understand what they're looking at,

179
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.460
like their understanding of what is going on at a company like Amazon is so

180
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.170
terrestrial. If we're talking, if they're in outer space, these guys are,

181
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.770
you know, all of.

182
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.410
<v 2>Every week I go on and on now I find it. I find more and more creepy stuff.</v>

183
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.760
Like at first they just had a few like Amazon basic items.

184
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.400
Now it's like every product that you look up,

185
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.200
they already have an Amazon brand that makes it it's amazing. I just,

186
00:10:56.201 --> 00:10:57.830
I don't know. It creeps me out every time.

187
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.120
<v 1>For weird. They have, they have their own brand for literally as my Newt,</v>

188
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.530
as like a pen, a lighter to as big as like a.

189
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.680
<v 2>Well, any closing thing, you would look up.</v>

190
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.920
<v 1>Shopping products, EV everything, they have it.</v>

191
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.780
<v 0>They they're a machine.</v>

192
00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:18.200
So what they do is they have this marketplace and then they have this giant data

193
00:11:18.201 --> 00:11:21.050
dashboard. They figure out as soon as like something's selling of this turn low,

194
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.290
right. They're like they, they go and make it.

195
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:28.100
And so you have these horror stories of this company being like, you know,

196
00:11:28.101 --> 00:11:31.520
I sold on Amazon and I was happy until one day, like, you know, the,

197
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:35.300
their competitor came and I couldn't get into the search listings and now I am

198
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:39.230
dead. And like, they they're this giant,

199
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.310
uh, money machine that just comes in. And like,

200
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:48.140
it's a combination of like endless resources and endless access to us

201
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.360
and our needs and then endless data, uh, like there's no, there,

202
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.940
there is no real competition. Um, there there's something like,

203
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:03.160
there's something that has changed about capitalism. Um, and,

204
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:07.180
and the problem is that we pretend it's still like the seventies and eighties

205
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.980
like that there is like a genuine market between firms when you have these,

206
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.650
uh, these companies that have just reached unprecedented scale size

207
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:19.570
resources. Uh,

208
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:24.340
and it's being facilitated by this new version of, uh,

209
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:29.020
of the markets where there are certain companies that just everyone's going to

210
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:33.910
pile into because they're absorbing more and more of the

211
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:37.630
economy. It's like, you, you look up and just, you know, you ask anyone.

212
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:42.190
It's like, um, you know, like, like Amazon, Apple,

213
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:45.580
Facebook, Google would be the big ones where you just look up and being like,

214
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.670
Hey, you know, if you close your eyes and open them 10 years from now, like,

215
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:52.960
do you think those companies will still be, um, kicking and dominating?

216
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.810
Like the answer is yes. In the less, uh,

217
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.490
in less the government were to change something for one of those companies. Um,

218
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.600
and you're starting to see glimmers of that possibility,

219
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.000
uh, because people are starting to recognize some of the extremes. Um,

220
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.730
I may be part of this conversation moving forward too.

221
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.340
<v 1>Oh, Jeff Bezos just found his biggest worst enemy.</v>

222
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.740
It's not hard floor. Jeff.

223
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.210
You've been looking in the wrong place at the wrong. Okay.

224
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.080
And closing, I want to ask you one final question.

225
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.980
You have endorsed, uh, Joe Biden.

226
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.720
Tell me why do you think Joe Biden will make a better president than Donald

227
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.553
Trump?

228
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.750
<v 0>Joe Biden would make a better president of the Donald Trump on many,</v>

229
00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:47.070
many levels, but the things I love about Joe, number one,

230
00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:50.040
he's actually a good dude who cares about people and wants,

231
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.840
wants to do right by people. Number two is he's really not very ideological.

232
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.400
He's more of like a pragmatist where he's like, what are we going to do? Um,

233
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.460
and as part of his pregnant, TISM, he's a consensus seeker.

234
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.780
He tries to figure out what the folks around him think is the right approach.

235
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.860
And he's not going to be someone and being like, no, screw you. Like,

236
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.630
I'm sure like the way to go. And it's not what you're saying. Like,

237
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.470
he'll actually be like, well, if people think that this is the way to go,

238
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.030
like I'm into it. And then the third thing, uh, is, was something I said,

239
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.040
um, at that convention,

240
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.100
which is that Joe has this quality where anything he says becomes the new

241
00:14:26.101 --> 00:14:27.630
reasonable. Um,

242
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.580
like he came out with a $2 trillion green energy proposal that could have

243
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:36.090
been straight out of the Bernie or arc like a playbook.

244
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.720
And if one of them had said it, people would have been like, Oh, like, you know,

245
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.300
uh, aggressive pie in the sky. But then Joe says it and was like, yeah,

246
00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:43.134
that's cool.

247
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.200
<v 1>That you can.</v>

248
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.730
<v 0>That, that if Joe gets on board with something or champions,</v>

249
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.030
and then all a sudden it becomes the new mainstream.

250
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.760
And so you have to ask yourself, it's like, okay,

251
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.560
maybe I just agree with John some stuff, but it's like, what,

252
00:14:58.561 --> 00:15:02.330
what's my preferred path, trying to convince Joe, that this is a good idea,

253
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.600
or try and convince Donald Trump that he should, you know,

254
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.650
like adopt an incomplete, completely different approach to governance. Uh,

255
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.530
and I mean, that, that to me is a no brainer.

256
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.220
<v 3>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
