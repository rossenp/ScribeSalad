1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.000
<v 0>Uh, what do you, what are your thoughts on the election so far?</v>

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.710
<v 1>Yeah, look, I think overall it's a good thing.</v>

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.680
It's a good night for Democrats. Um, you know,

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.730
Joe Biden is going to win the white house and he will have, you know,

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.470
expanded the map a little bit with, you know, picking up Arizona and, you know,

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.840
Georgia, I'm still seeing some weird stuff out of Georgia.

7
00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:23.450
And I think we still have a shot at Georgia. Um,

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.670
but the one thing that drives me nuts is seeing still Democrats

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.650
acting like we've lost this election,

10
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.250
even though we're going to take back the white house. And you know,

11
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:38.030
that if that, if Donald Trump were in the same position that Joe Biden more,

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.040
you know, right now, um, you know,

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.570
in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, you know,

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.010
Arizona, that he would be claiming some massive mandate, right.

15
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.060
And instead Dems are still, you know, wetting the bed and, and,

16
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:55.010
and pointing fingers.

17
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:58.130
When I think that we should take some pride in the fact that we won this

18
00:00:58.131 --> 00:00:58.880
election.

19
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.970
<v 2>I think some of that though is like an emotional mitigation to,</v>

20
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.680
to evade like a 2016 heartbreak and be able to

21
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:10.790
rejoice, uh, when we actually get a positive result. I'm not sure.

22
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.030
<v 1>Yeah. Maybe. Um, I also just,</v>

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.530
I also think that there was such a misfire in terms of the polling,

24
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.730
um, in terms of Democrats confidence, in terms of like the,

25
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.590
if you watch the cable news coverage, right. If you watched MSNBC, CNN,

26
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.250
you know, you're obviously going to be a little bit let down from,

27
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.330
by these results. But, um, you know, a lot of people got,

28
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.490
got some things very wrong in this race,

29
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:40.400
and I think that's going to be something that we're going to have to examine

30
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:41.234
afterwards.

31
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.090
<v 0>As we're talking about this.</v>

32
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.040
And this just happened with wi Wisconsin and Def officially fell for Joe

33
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:50.270
Biden. However,

34
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.850
that poll was somewhere between nine points to 17 points for

35
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.020
Joe Biden. Um, and like good quote unquote, good pollsters. Um,

36
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.030
they're obviously not good. They're terrible. And this poll,

37
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.440
this state like Biden clearly won it, but by 21,000 votes,

38
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.560
like that's essential tie. Um,

39
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.270
so what I'm like, my mind's blown. I'm like, Oh, and like, you know,

40
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:17.300
this from working in communication in general, like being on the campaign where,

41
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.030
how much, I think the media misses things,

42
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:23.810
or like the people on one side and like the narratives are on this other side.

43
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.460
Um, so like, if you had to guess, like what,

44
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.510
why are the polls so off? Like why is it a narrative so wrong?

45
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:35.150
Is it because they're bad pollsters, maybe that's it. Or is this like,

46
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.300
is there's this media buyer that's fueling it? Where do you land on that?

47
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.990
<v 1>It's combination of those two? Um, and look, a win is a win. I,</v>

48
00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:48.830
I don't care. [inaudible] right. Like I, as I,

49
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.450
uh, my view here always was Joe Biden just needs to win by one vote in Michigan,

50
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:56.810
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. I don't give a about a ran date. Okay.

51
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.820
I just want to win here. Um, and sorry, sorry.

52
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.580
Sorry for my language. Um,

53
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.860
but I do think that sometimes I think that the political class and the,

54
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.990
the political professional class does sometimes just miss the Mark

55
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.940
on Donald Trump and does not understand his appeal and, um,

56
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.250
always how to, how to reach his supporters.

57
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:25.060
And I think that that's going to be a story of this campaign too,

58
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:29.290
is that once again, like in 2016, the pollsters, um,

59
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.010
didn't quite captured, uh, you know, Donald Trump's enduring strength.

60
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.100
And that's one of the things that we've seen down-ballot right,

61
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.480
is a lot of the races, um, that we lost, you know, Senate races,

62
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:44.620
house races were in tough red districts and that, you know,

63
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.400
Donald Trump performed really, really well. And,

64
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:52.750
and there's a view that he's like this an barren monster and that no one is

65
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.630
going to support him, just really doesn't comport with the facts.

66
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.360
And I think that we've got to understand that, you know,

67
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.400
he is a Republican and he is like,

68
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.230
I H Republicans are going to back him and that he's not just history's greatest

69
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:10.000
monster and that people are going to run away from him in droves. So,

70
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.120
so true. Um, Eric, I saw your mouth when you're going to say something, sorry.

71
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.710
<v 2>No, no. I was just nodding my head along with,</v>

72
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.740
with everything that I was talking about. I do, um,

73
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.450
I do want to talk about one of your superpowers and obviously it's something

74
00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:28.290
that I've been wanting to chat with you a while about. Um, you know, uh,

75
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.490
obviously we both worked for candidates, um, that,

76
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.660
uh, ran in a very crowded primary. Um,

77
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.150
and I'd be lying if I said I didn't, uh, work towards, um,

78
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.910
at least, uh, your earned media capabilities and,

79
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.560
and looking at different and emerging media, uh, like podcasts and other things.

80
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.810
Um, I applied those lessons both to my time for Tim Ryan,

81
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.330
uh, as well as with Andrew gang, um, uh, for two reasons, number one,

82
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.310
uh, it definitely seemed like it was working a number two. Um, just like Pete,

83
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.420
you know, I got to work with two messengers that were comfortable, uh,

84
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.140
being able to, to work in those environments. Uh, now, you know,

85
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:16.650
obviously the General's difference, um, and, uh,

86
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.270
both candidates have collective name ID going into the general, uh, and perhaps,

87
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:23.760
you know, obviously being more comfortable in those controlled environments,

88
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:28.290
but I think back to your New York times, op-ed back in the spring, uh,

89
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:32.760
in terms of guidance, uh, for the Biden campaign. And do you feel like, um,

90
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.950
you know, uh, embracing more of those strategies would have helped more,

91
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.580
uh, in helping shape, uh, the outcome going into election night?

92
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.830
<v 1>Um, so I don't know,</v>

93
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.750
I don't know that I've seen enough where I can definitively say that I

94
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:53.040
do generally think that communicating more and being more transparent and

95
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:55.470
available is a good thing. Um,

96
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.450
and being out there more is a generally a good thing. And, you know,

97
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:04.250
I think we can all admit that because of the constraints of the, um,

98
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.320
as a coronavirus of, you know,

99
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.600
running in the middle of a global pandemic that, that did sort of, um,

100
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.750
uh, hold down, you know, Biden's ability to get out there a bit more. Um,

101
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.220
and I think that they effectively use surrogates.

102
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.020
I know Pete did over like 170 interviews on behalf of the Biden

103
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:30.080
campaign, which is nuts. We just tally that up. Um,

104
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.920
but I always think I, and, and I'm not gonna,

105
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.750
I don't want a Monday morning quarterback.

106
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.150
I don't want to do anything cause everyone's got to run the race,

107
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:41.990
but my general advice to anyone running for president,

108
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.600
anyone running for any office is to get out there more and to,

109
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:48.230
to be a little bit more, you know,

110
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.160
to always try to be aggressive and visible with the media and especially with,

111
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.940
um, you know, outside of the political bubble. Right. And that's a good,

112
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.430
that's something that you guys did on the yang campaign. You know,

113
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.850
I know a lot of Democrats were critical that he went on like Joe Rogan,

114
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.820
but give me a break. How are you going to turn down that audience?

115
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:05.810
It is massive.

116
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.440
And that's part of the reason game of Thrones Sunday night prime time. Right.

117
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.130
Exactly, exactly. And it's like, that's,

118
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.340
I think that was sort of like one of your first big moments, right.

119
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.470
Is when you did that. Um, and I think that, you know,

120
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:23.120
sometimes Democrats can be a little bit precious about, um, how we communicate,

121
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.190
how much we communicate, um,

122
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.610
when really what we just need to do is just go out there and get our message out

123
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:29.444
there.

124
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.490
<v 2>Yeah, no, I agree. And, and piggybacking off of that though, um, you know,</v>

125
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:35.650
you were just on a bill show,

126
00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:40.060
which has a marginally better reach than yang speaks here, but it's fantastic

127
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.440
marginally. Uh, but, um, you know, uh, bill asked you about on the,

128
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.000
on the, you know, these Trump car caravans, I saw one of the scares. Um,

129
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.830
but, uh, you know,

130
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:57.700
he mentioned why we didn't see these things on the democratic side,

131
00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:01.330
and you said so eloquently because we're not a call,

132
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.590
which I thought was hysterical. Fantastic. Um,

133
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.980
but like, do you feel like we need to be,

134
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.990
is that something that's missing?

135
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.420
<v 1>So I've, you know,</v>

136
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.070
this is something I think about from time to time I've thought about, um,

137
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.580
and no, I just don't, I don't think we need to be. Um,

138
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.290
and there are real life consequences to, you know, the behaviors of,

139
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.730
um, you know, the, of the manga people, right. You know, you see that,

140
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.620
that study that showed that, you know,

141
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:39.850
700 people who had attended Trump rallies, um, you know,

142
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.700
passed away from the COVID from COVID and you know,

143
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:44.560
that there were thousands and thousands of,

144
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.600
of COVID infections that they could tie,

145
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.590
COVID-19 getting infections that they could tie back to those rallies. Um,

146
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.610
but no, I do think that's passion is a good thing though,

147
00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:56.760
and that is something that we could probably,

148
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.420
that we should always work toward and, and, um, in our politics.

149
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.340
But I don't think that we need to become like a cult.

150
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.890
There's probably some good middle ground. Um,

151
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.370
I also just don't know that this was the election cycle for that sort of

152
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:11.730
attitude among, you know, among Democrats. Right.

153
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.440
I just think a lot of us ended up coming down to, um, Joe Biden,

154
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.300
being someone that people were comfortable with he's uh, uh,

155
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.860
and someone that they trusted enough to sort of lead us through the fallout of

156
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:25.170
the Trump presidency. Um,

157
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.220
I don't think that someone like a Bernie Sanders who definitely does have a lot

158
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.650
more of that culture personality, um,

159
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.490
I don't think we would be sitting here talking about a win if he had been the

160
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.880
nominee, even though he inspires a lot stronger feelings.

161
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.980
<v 2>Yeah. What would you, what would you say? And you have the map obviously,</v>

162
00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:47.210
and how, how seemingly divided things look, what would be,

163
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.370
you know, an early great public facing opportunity, uh,

164
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.560
for the Biden transition to look at,

165
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.450
as they're trying to bridge the divide and bring the country back together after

166
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:00.980
what will seemingly be,

167
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.520
not a very easy transition to say the least.

168
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.350
<v 1>I think he's, I think it's an opportunity to go big. Um,</v>

169
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.580
and this is really an opportunity to show,

170
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.930
to be the opposite of Donald Trump to be the opposite sort of,

171
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.570
of the GOP generally. Right. Um,

172
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.090
Donald Trump has been very divisive.

173
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.710
The Republicans in the Senate who are likely gonna just

174
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.220
continue to do what they've been doing for the last question of the years are

175
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:33.860
going to be very diff divisive and partisan.

176
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.960
And so I think it's incumbent upon Biden to sort of set the stage that, um,

177
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.550
uh, that he's going to try to work in good faith, try to bridge the divide.

178
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.730
And I think he's got to just try to do that sort of know,

179
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.600
palette to have that sort of pallet changer of a moment. Um,

180
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:55.010
I don't think it makes sense to come out guns, a blazing being super partisan.

181
00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:58.040
Like we're gonna, you know, Ram all this stuff down your throat.

182
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.180
I think he's got to try to strike, um, uh, a more, you know,

183
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:06.950
a more positive unifying message at the beginning and find him

184
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.070
an, uh, powerful, symbolic way to do that.

185
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.290
What do you guys think?

186
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.540
<v 0>Yeah, Andrew said something really interesting a while back. Um,</v>

187
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.030
and you said Joe Biden becomes a really interesting figure because of the lane

188
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:26.570
he's in no matter what he says, it becomes a new normal,

189
00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:30.530
or at least normal for the Democrats. And so Biden and we,

190
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:33.230
Joe Biden came out for cash relief for universal basic income.

191
00:11:33.231 --> 00:11:36.050
If he comes out for a version of Medicare for all,

192
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.310
or at least a better government healthcare option, um,

193
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.720
or anything climate is like climate change plan is pretty aggressive. Um, like,

194
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:48.890
so like if he does that, that becomes way more normalized, you know,

195
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.500
than if Bernie ever did it or no. Yeah.

196
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.070
And I think he's got.

197
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.310
<v 1>To go on the account. Like I,</v>

198
00:11:55.311 --> 00:12:00.250
I just think right now is climate change is so important, but he's got a really,

199
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.180
I think this is the time to really push through sort of more of an economic

200
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:05.530
message. I agree.

201
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.870
<v 2>I agree way of employing empathy will be, uh,</v>

202
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.060
greeted positively overall. Um,

203
00:12:12.061 --> 00:12:15.660
and I think the things that he was so famous to be remembered for during his

204
00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:18.000
Obama years will have a greater display.

205
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.640
And once he gets to move out of this campaign mode,

206
00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:22.740
and I think that's what people forget,

207
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:26.430
and I think that's what his bread and butter truly is. So, um,

208
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.720
I think some of his natural capabilities will help play a role in how he helps,

209
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.130
you know, bring the country together in some.

210
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.050
<v 1>Respects. Yeah, no, I agree with that.</v>
