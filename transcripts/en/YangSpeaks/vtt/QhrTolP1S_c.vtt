WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 0>And I think people, people need to be willing to accept some,</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.910
uh, some truths that will hurt them. Personally. In other words,

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.410
people are very invested in these two parties.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.190
Uh, there are Democrats who are very invested in the democratic party and

5
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:20.430
Republicans who are very invested in the Republican party and they see their

6
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:24.780
leaders, whether it's Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump or whoever it might be as,

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.540
um, as sorts of heroes.

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.710
And they have to be willing to accept that some of these people at the top,

9
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.890
including people that they Revere are not the heroes.

10
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:36.390
And I'm not trying to put you on the spot.

11
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:38.130
I don't know who you like or who you don't like,

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.060
but what I'm telling you as a member of Congress, cause I'm in there.

13
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:45.660
And I see it with my eyes. I can see it firsthand up close.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.400
There are leaders on both sides of the aisle and people will say, Oh,

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.100
don't both sides stuff. Well, this is, this is the truth.

16
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.680
This is the truth of what's wrong with Congress.

17
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.700
There are leaders on both sides of the aisle who believes so strongly in the

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.590
performative aspect of government and their primary

19
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:09.180
goal is to maintain the power they have through this performance. Uh,

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.930
they're, they're more like Hollywood entertainers than anything else.

21
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.050
And this is on both sides of the aisle, not just Democrats,

22
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.560
not just Republicans, it's both Republicans and Democrats.

23
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.280
And it really starts with the leadership teams. Um,

24
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.440
I can assure you that we could have gotten something through the house, um,

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.750
and through the Senate on criminal justice reform,

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.680
but there wasn't really a desire to do so. And we have to reckon,

27
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.600
we have to reckon with that, that,

28
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.560
that actually some of the people who are telling you let's get things done.

29
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.290
Don't want the resolution because it's preferable to have it as a campaign

30
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:50.220
issue or to, for example, not give Donald Trump the win.

31
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.910
<v 1>Yeah. Why are more members of Congress not banging the table on this?</v>

32
00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:54.140
And I have a hunch. I mean,

33
00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:56.870
it has something to do with the performative aspects you talked about,

34
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.470
which is if you go to the town hall and then people are like, Hey,

35
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:02.960
we need this and this. And like the, the easy thing to do,

36
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:05.900
having been a candidate, um, though sometimes, you know, I mean,

37
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:09.320
obviously I wasn't in office, like, you know, in many ways, um,

38
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.110
it was both easier and harder for me, but you say, yes,

39
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:15.320
we have to get that done is like the easy thing to do.

40
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.840
The hard thing to do would be to say, and Hey, I guess I,

41
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.500
I have no input in that because we're the minority party right now.

42
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.790
And they have a closed legislative process. It doesn't even allow love Edwards,

43
00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:28.070
so there's going to serve it up. And then we'd like, like, like it's, I mean,

44
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:32.030
it's very hard to present the second picture because it makes you seem, uh,

45
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.080
less like you're going to go back there and like, do do the, you know,

46
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:37.820
what they want you to do. Um,

47
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.820
but it sounds like the second might be a more accurate picture for many.

48
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.050
<v 0>Yeah. I watch these, I'm seeing all these campaign ads right now,</v>

49
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.840
and everyone's saying, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. And I'm like,

50
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.560
no, you're not,

51
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.740
you're not going to do that because you have no power to do it there,

52
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:55.790
the system isn't designed to let you do that. And you asked, well,

53
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.910
why don't the, um, um, members of Congress? Why, you know,

54
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:05.140
why don't they talk about this? And, and the,

55
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.430
the sad truth is that the majority of them

56
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.290
prefer this system. And, you know,

57
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:18.010
just to go through that a little bit, when you think about it,

58
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.860
it's actually a pretty easy life for them. Okay. They,

59
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.790
they come to Congress. If they, um,

60
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.340
bend the knee for leadership and just say,

61
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.100
we'll go along with whatever show you're doing. You know,

62
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.850
you're putting on the Democrat show or you're putting on the Republican show or

63
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:41.680
whatever, we'll go along with it. As long as they, um,

64
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.330
you know, play along and do the performance, they are taking care of their baby.

65
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.090
Um, and imagine someone, I, I try to frame it this way.

66
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.660
When people say, Justin, why don't you run for speaker? Okay, well,

67
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.960
here's why they would never choose me as speaker,

68
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.490
because I would tell them we're going to open up the process and you're going to

69
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:06.340
have a lot of votes. And these votes are going to be tough.

70
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.020
They're going to put you on the spot.

71
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.810
And instead of spending all my time fundraising for my particular party,

72
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.060
which is how the speaker operates today, you know,

73
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:20.050
a whole bunch of time is spent fundraising. So if I were running for speaker,

74
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.620
I'd say, guess what? That's not going to be the focus of my work.

75
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:26.830
My focus is going to be making sure the institution runs properly.

76
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.550
It's not going to be out there raising money for my political party.

77
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.160
If I were a Republican, for example, at the time, um,

78
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.980
it's not going to be to go out there and raise money for Republicans or make

79
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:37.600
sure Republicans win everywhere.

80
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.840
I'm going to be focused on making sure that this institution runs smoothly.

81
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.561
And you know,

82
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:44.500
what the members of Congress would say to me who are going to vote for speaker,

83
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:48.460
they'd say, well, no, thanks. Um, we don't want that kind of speaker.

84
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:53.320
We want the speaker who tells us just, um,

85
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.190
you know, give me your voting card and I'll take care of everything for you.

86
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.660
If you get attacked in your district, or you get a primary challenge,

87
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.820
we're there for you. We'll S we'll spend millions of dollars to protect you. Um,

88
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.460
if you, uh, vote with the speaker,

89
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.320
we'll give you whatever committee assignment you want. They,

90
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:15.880
they prefer that system. It's an easy life. Uh,

91
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.420
when I go to the house floor on average,

92
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.560
I would say the members of Congress, most of them, uh,

93
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.190
90% do not actually know what we're voting on.

94
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.170
Like they know some rough idea of what the bill is. Like,

95
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.540
they might know it's about a particular topic,

96
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.870
but they actually don't know the workings of the legislation.

97
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.110
And there's no one holding them accountable.

98
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.730
<v 1>The two numbers that I'm throwing out there to the public, Justin,</v>

99
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.020
around this set of phenomenon,

100
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:49.050
you just described congressional approval rating as a body,

101
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:53.970
21% re-election rate of individual members, 94%, you know? So like,

102
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.330
they're big. Like, Hey, let, uh, make sure I get reelected.

103
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:03.830
And then like the overall performance is actually not that material to

104
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.140
my, my reelection prospects.

105
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.160
<v 0>And I see this all the time, by the way, I see this all the time in funny ways,</v>

106
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:16.540
like I'll be on Twitter and someone will say my, uh,

107
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:18.640
my favorite representatives are,

108
00:06:18.641 --> 00:06:23.320
and then they'll list like a few who are kind of well-known

109
00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:26.080
and maybe ones that even I think are pretty good ones.

110
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.460
And then they'll list their own representative. And I'll be like,

111
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.440
that guy is like, not this, he's not the same as these other.

112
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.443
Right. But,

113
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.790
but people think that their own representative is great. And I think it,

114
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:43.121
again,

115
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:47.920
it has to do with like sort of the messaging back home and people falling

116
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:51.280
for it. And it's not the fault of people at home. They're busy,

117
00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:55.750
they've got their, you know, they're, they're super busy with their lives. Um,

118
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.660
I think probably people actually know, uh,

119
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.250
more today about politics than they ever did in the past. So I,

120
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:07.300
I don't want to criticize people at home for not knowing, uh,

121
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.380
and I don't know what to make of that other than like, you know, that's,

122
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.090
that shows that the performance works, you know, the, the theater works.

123
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.350
Um,

124
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.000
but liking the person personally does not translate to the person being a good

125
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:23.260
member of Congress. I mean, they,

126
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.740
there are lots of really likable people who are terrible members of Congress.

127
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.791
And, you know,

128
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:31.360
there are actually a few unlikeable people who are really good members of

129
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:35.500
Congress. So it's, I don't want to name names here either, but,

130
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.120
but there just are,

131
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:40.810
there are some people who are not that charismatic and not that likable.

132
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:44.770
And I look at the moment, this is a pretty good member of Congress, you know,

133
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.070
not flashy. Um, but they,

134
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.940
they get the job done and I can tell the person really understands things and is

135
00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:53.170
working hard, Justin.

136
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.280
<v 1>Among the other members of Congress. Cause you've been around, um, you know, uh,</v>

137
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.570
in, in the chambers, who else is similarly, uh,

138
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.420
disgusted with the current state of affairs and wants to clean up the mechanics

139
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:09.100
like who the other members of Congress were like, well,

140
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.780
if they were in charge and they would actually be like, look,

141
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.220
let's try and make this place work again.

142
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.040
<v 0>So, um,</v>

143
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:21.160
there are a lot of them who talk privately about this and you know,

144
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:24.070
I'm not sure I want to go through all the names of my colleagues on this,

145
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:28.360
but I would say that it's a, it's a minority of Congress. In other words,

146
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.540
you have maybe, um,

147
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.900
a couple dozen to maybe 50 members who really care about

148
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:42.850
this and would really welcome this kind

149
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:47.440
of change. Uh, maybe, maybe even up to a hundred members out of the 435,

150
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.300
who'd welcome the change. Even if some of them aren't that focused on it. Uh,

151
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.240
and then the rest of them over 300 who not welcome making it,

152
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.340
um, actually a more open process or making the legislation more readable.

153
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.420
There are people. And I wouldn't say it's, um, a partisan thing.

154
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.320
Uh it's it's across the aisle. I know. Um, for example,

155
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:12.770
I'll just give you one prominent one, uh, because it's,

156
00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:17.340
it's not a secret or anything. AOC has many, many times, um,

157
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.330
echoed my tweets or like some of my tweets where I've talked about this broken

158
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:24.930
process. I think she'd welcome something more open. Um,

159
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.740
I believe it's not an, it's not an ideological. It's not like an.

160
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.630
<v 2>I know it's, it's something else. It's like an integrity thing.</v>

161
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.460
<v 0>Right. And, and, um, she's another example of,</v>

162
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.340
um, someone who I've been impressed with in,

163
00:09:42.341 --> 00:09:46.610
in the sense that she, she votes what she believes. Um,

164
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.650
I can't speak to that on every single vote,

165
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.270
but I have seen a number of votes where she has been willing to buck her party.

166
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.440
And that matters. That matters whether you agree with her ideologically or not.

167
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.730
And I certainly have a lot of disagreements with her and other areas where we

168
00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:05.510
agree. So I don't want to want to say it's, you know, all disagreements,

169
00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:09.290
there are lots of areas where we would agree, but, um,

170
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.790
but at least I feel when she votes, she's,

171
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.830
she's doing it out of a place of integrity.

172
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.970
She is staying true to what she told her constituents you would do.

173
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.590
And I respect that. And I think that we need more legislators like that.

174
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:28.460
It doesn't matter whether they are right or left.

175
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.500
I just want people who are honest.

176
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.880
I want to a whole bunch of progressives and a whole bunch of libertarians and a

177
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:36.050
whole bunch of conservatives.

178
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:40.850
Let's put us all together and let's work through the issues in an

179
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:44.900
open and honest way. And, um, and there are those members out there,

180
00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:48.350
but they're just, there's just not that many, unfortunately, because the system,

181
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.880
the system meets them up.

182
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.650
