1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>You know, obviously this is my country, this is my home.</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.960
And the idea that a big let's face it,

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.890
a big chunk of this country does not see me as American.

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:15.660
It does not accept me as American, even though I know it's not,

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.120
the problem is not with me. The problem is with them.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.290
It's still a little heartbreaking to me and it's still, it still gets to me,

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.900
you know, uh, the fact that what is it,

8
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.650
44% of the country probably wouldn't see me as,

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.090
as belonging here.

10
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.720
<v 1>I feel like you might be an exception, my friend,</v>

11
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:36.770
where if they've seen you in something that all of a sudden you become familiar

12
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:38.990
to them in a way that, um,

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.940
that that might hopefully, uh, engender, uh, you know,

14
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:47.600
some positivity. I feel like you'd get that.

15
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:51.770
If you went to a lot of places and when you were performing your comedy,

16
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.980
I feel like you might know this country in a way that a lot of people don't

17
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:59.960
because comedians head to small towns and medium-sized cities

18
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:04.310
and work like a club where, like you said, like, you know,

19
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:06.770
a few dozen drunk people show off that they're there.

20
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:10.130
And you're there with a bunch of other comics that you ended up staying

21
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.390
overnight in places that a lot of Americans will never see and never visit.

22
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:18.260
Did you have that experience as a comedian or were you more exclusively in

23
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:19.220
Chicago? In New York?

24
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.760
<v 0>Um, I certainly had that experience. Not as much.</v>

25
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.280
I couldn't do it in Chicago because I couldn't make money.

26
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:27.800
So I would go sometimes do the shows just to do them,

27
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:32.600
but certainly in New York I have done tours of tiny, tiny towns. And,

28
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.780
you know, I grew up in a really big city. I grew up in Karachi,

29
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:39.650
which is like 20 million people. I've I lived in Chicago. I lived in,

30
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.843
lived in New York.

31
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.800
So I was always very like metropolitan going to these small towns was

32
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:49.670
really very eye-opening because I'll be honest, you know, before I went to them,

33
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.770
I was a little bit, I thought, Oh, I, I, I don't see the appeal.

34
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:57.800
Like if I lived there, I would move out. But then going there,

35
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:02.330
you do a show in a tiny town. I did this show thinking of this specific one.

36
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.720
I did a show in a tiny town in Ohio. Then afterwards,

37
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.770
everybody went to a bar and all the people from the show went to the bar and I

38
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:13.250
was kind of hanging out and talking to these people who sort of grown up there.

39
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.940
And some of them had been like best friends with each other since the second

40
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:21.440
grade, you know? Um, and I thought that that was really beautiful.

41
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.450
And even though a lot of these people may not agree with me politically now,

42
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800
I really,

43
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.030
I realized that as trite as this sounds,

44
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.690
we all truly have a lot more in common than we don't.

45
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.490
I know sometimes it's, that gets obscured by, by, um,

46
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.650
by just the conversation and, and sort of the screaming at each other. But, uh,

47
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.600
I, it made me feel ultimately optimistic about,

48
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.860
about where we're headed in this grand experiment.

49
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.350
<v 1>The only thing comedians, uh,</v>

50
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.210
could be the great unifying of our

51
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.340
society in part,

52
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:06.560
because of those experiences that so many of you had.

53
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.930
<v 0>A lot of pressure to put on a bunch of drugs and drug addicts, dude.</v>

54
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.620
<v 1>Just in, uh, um, well, w one place that feels very, very uplifting.</v>

55
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.020
And I I'd urge you to try and get there though.

56
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.680
I guess it'd be far field for you. Uh, you know, then you're, you know,

57
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:25.200
you're probably not going to, you know, break isolation. Um,

58
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.930
but Dave Chappelle has, uh,

59
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.760
as a cornfield near his house and he's been doing live comedy shows there with,

60
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.870
uh, comedians who just come and go, essentially, I think they,

61
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.480
their nickname for it was Chappelle summer camp. So yeah,

62
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.350
it actually takes some of the ingredients you're describing where it's a very

63
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:46.170
small town, but people are discovering,

64
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.750
it's essentially like a field of dreams of comedy.

65
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.490
The whole thing blows your mind.

66
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:52.470
Like you go there and because it's a corn field,

67
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:55.320
everyone's spread out and it's very socially distanced. You're just like,

68
00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:56.071
what am I seeing?

69
00:03:56.071 --> 00:04:00.540
I'm seeing like some of the best comedians in the world in this

70
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.020
cornfield. Uh, and it felt quintessentially American in part,

71
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:07.800
because of the backdrop. It's like just fields of corn in the summer.

72
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.360
It was a gazebo anyway. So, um, but,

73
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.530
but the comedians I talked to because they interact with people in the same way

74
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:19.860
you do, it's like, look, we all have a lot in common.

75
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:21.780
We all want the same things. Uh,

76
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.190
and there are these political discussions that are trying to pit us against each

77
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:30.090
other in a way that I don't think would apply if we were just sitting across the

78
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.180
kitchen table from each other, or if we were in the same bar at the same night,

79
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.320
like then you would just end up bonding over your common humanity, uh,

80
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.820
instead of, you know,

81
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.140
typing some nasty comment in Twitter or Facebook or,

82
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.100
or what have you. Um, so I'm,

83
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.980
I'm serious that I feel like, uh,

84
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.340
comedians are having a different conversation with Americans, uh,

85
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.630
than politicians, for sure. Like a better conversation in, in many respects.

86
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.120
<v 0>I think that's right. I think that's right. Um, what you said about, you know,</v>

87
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:06.090
I w one of my best friends in the world is India and people always like a

88
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:08.820
Pakistani and Indian, and it's like, yeah,

89
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.860
those lines don't exist when you're like sitting next to someone or

90
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.010
eating with them. You know, I always find like, if you look at the big SIG,

91
00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:21.810
there's a lot of eating scenes that happen whenever people, uh,

92
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.860
whenever walls come down and people connect. And I really feel like, you know,

93
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.540
if, if, if the world could,

94
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.760
if I could bring some of these people in and feed them Pakistani food,

95
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.700
I don't think they could think of that place in the way that they think of it

96
00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.650
right now. Cause cause our foods do.

97
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.533
<v 1>Yes,</v>

98
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.580
well said Kumail's effort will be like Pakistani restaurants across the

99
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:49.230
country. Letting people know that this place is too delicious to dislike.

100
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.860
<v 0>Right. I mean, that is what we are.</v>

101
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:57.650
We're too delicious to dislike that that should be on our flag. That, that,

102
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.010
I mean, that's a.

103
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.970
<v 1>Pretty good tagline, uh, comedians and chaps bringing the world together.</v>

104
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:03.980
I don't, I don't mind it. Uh,

105
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.790
so when you talk about the politics of this moment, so you've got a green card,

106
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.230
um, are you a citizen now or are you still trafficking? And I am. Oh,

107
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.500
so you have the freaking full rights and privileges. You took the test.

108
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.850
Was the test as hard as they say.

109
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.670
<v 0>No, the test was pretty easy. Um, in fact why I,</v>

110
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:24.760
I don't know how much I get sick, cause I don't.

111
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.740
Cause I read some things where they were like, Oh,

112
00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:29.200
we can start revoking citizenships and all this stuff.

113
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.280
<v 1>Oh, you're in for good. Don't worry about it. You can spill the beans.</v>

114
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.590
Nothing's going to happen. It's irreversible.

115
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.960
<v 0>I went in and I sat with this guy and I was really nervous and he was an Asian,</v>

116
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.880
he was an Asian guy. Very nice. And uh, right from the beginning, he was like,

117
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.390
he asked me a couple of questions and then he saw I was nervous and he was like,

118
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.840
don't be nervous. You're going to pass. Don't worry about this.

119
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.650
And I just thought it was really, really sweet. Like he didn't have to do that.

120
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.960
He didn't have to put me at these, you know,

121
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.240
he didn't have to make me feel better.

122
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.230
The person who interviewed us for the green card certainly didn't do that.

123
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:09.140
She was trying to get us. She was trying to get us to contradict ourselves and,

124
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.150
and you know, she was like, she was certainly like aggressive. Uh,

125
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.650
but this guy was super nice. So th the, the test wasn't, it was not that hard.

126
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:20.350
No. So yeah, I'm here for good kind of get rid of me.

127
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.840
<v 1>Yeah, look, it is full rights and privileges. So, so, and you know,</v>

128
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.600
you you're paying noodles and taxes, which will be accept people very happy.

129
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.200
<v 0>Yeah. It's California. It's a break percentage.</v>

130
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 1>Um, so you and I connected in part because there was, um,</v>

131
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.310
an Asian American political event. We're trying to rally folks in the community.

132
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.193
Um,

133
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.050
do you have a different perspective on what's going on politically as a result

134
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:53.110
of the fact that you had to essentially fight to stay in this country,

135
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:57.970
you become a citizen. Uh, and then now you are in my mind,

136
00:07:57.971 --> 00:08:02.710
one of the most prominent Pakistani American figures, which,

137
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.700
and I'm, I can relate to aspects of this because you know,

138
00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:11.170
there aren't that many like Asian American, um, uh, presidential candidates.

139
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.030
<v 0>No, that, not that many. Let me see how many I can think of.</v>

140
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.610
<v 1>Yeah. There's an Andrew Yang. Um, so, uh,</v>

141
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.280
I feel like you became a citizen just as our country started to really, um,

142
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.860
turn against each other or feel like it's getting torn apart. Um,

143
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.480
and I take it that you're with, so you know about me,

144
00:08:37.481 --> 00:08:39.940
like I've endorsed Joe and Kamilah like, uh, you know,

145
00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:42.130
I'm trying to get folks to just vote, vote, vote,

146
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.360
because I feel like the more people that vote the better off we're going to be.

147
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.090
Um, but I feel like you have a different perspective because you're like,

148
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.430
I kind of a recently minted American dude, it's like,

149
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.800
you had to to get it.

150
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.660
And then here we are at this political moment where it feels like there's a

151
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:03.330
ton at stake, uh, in November.

152
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.120
<v 0>Yeah. And you know, I always feel like obviously, uh,</v>

153
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.590
I relate to immigration issues, very intimately. And this,

154
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.780
the demonization of immigrants.

155
00:09:14.781 --> 00:09:18.830
You remember when they were talking about the caravan from Mexico and stuff? I,

156
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.690
it never, first of all,

157
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.520
I find it obviously moral and immoral and unethical.

158
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.920
But on top of that, it's also extremely illogical because, you know,

159
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.420
you were born here. We had to like fight to come here.

160
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.320
We chose America as our home. We gave up our lives. You know,

161
00:09:39.321 --> 00:09:41.270
we put everything on the line to choose,

162
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.590
to choose like better lives for ourselves and our families. I mean,

163
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.820
what's more American than that, right? The pursuit of life, what is it? Life,

164
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.610
Liberty, happiness, whatever it is. I don't remember from the citizenship.

165
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.630
<v 1>The test test was too long ago, a long time ago.</v>

166
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.600
<v 0>That should be something that's commanded. I mean, these people are patriotic.</v>

167
00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:05.720
They chose America. They weren't just born here. So,

168
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.970
so I find that it just never makes sense to me that people are able to

169
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:15.590
demonize immigrants so easily. And yeah, obviously this election is very,

170
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:18.950
very important. You know, my parents moved here after I did.

171
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:22.700
My parents have been here now maybe, uh,

172
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.280
like 12 years or so. Um,

173
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.950
and they moved from Karachi and they,

174
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.420
they landed here and they love America. You know, they were like, Oh my God,

175
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.500
things are like much easier here. They felt really accepted. They just,

176
00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:40.430
my mom was like seeing her that happy and that comfortable.

177
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:44.900
It just brought so much joy to me. And then in the last few years,

178
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.750
it's been very difficult for her. You know,

179
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:50.840
her relationship to America has changed and the way she looks,

180
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.610
the way she sees America has changed. Um, now when I talked to her,

181
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:01.610
uh, all she does is really talk about politics and how scared she is.

182
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.410
And she says, they don't want us here. I'm like, no, mom,

183
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.240
this is like, there's a certain percentage of people. This is not how it is.

184
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:13.460
Things can turn very quickly. And she was like,

185
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:15.860
she said something that really broke my heart. She was like, we already,

186
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.410
we already left Pakistan. Where, where do we go from here? Where will we go?

187
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:22.370
And we have to leave here.

188
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.680
<v 1>Heartbreaking. You know,</v>

189
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:27.620
she'd been here for 12 years and she's happy for the first 10 years.

190
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:29.840
And then the last two years, she was like, wait a minute. Like,

191
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.290
I'm not sure if this place actually wants people like me.

192
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.060
<v 0>Yeah. It's been, it's been really, really, really dumb.</v>

193
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.810
