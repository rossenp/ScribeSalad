1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.450
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.130
I think the thing about now is it's a real test for the media for

3
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:09.750
journalists and reporters like me on like stick to the facts, to the,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.100
to the data, follow the experts, follow the election commission nerves,

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.050
and all the people that actually putting this on,

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.970
on the ground instead of trying to guesstimate. Um, I think, you know,

7
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:25.170
there are places where president Trump over-performed or Biden,

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.980
underperformed, um, Florida being one of those places, right?

9
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:31.740
That was when you talked about an unexpected result. Um,

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.020
that was when they were feeling kind of confident about,

11
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.040
but the thing that Biden and when he talked to Biden people now,

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.090
even late last night,

13
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:42.780
when things started looking kind of shaky is that this is what they were

14
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:46.140
actually expecting for months. We kept hearing that, you know,

15
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:49.740
this is going to be a blowout, you know, political did not say that, um,

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.540
this is going to be a blowout. Um,

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.240
there's going to be a huge repudiation of president Trump.

18
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.820
That is not what we have seen. I think,

19
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.440
no matter what happens with this election at the end of the day,

20
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.640
president Trump was able to convince enough people in this country that their

21
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.090
lived experience, right? Their lived experience during a pandemic,

22
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.820
during a recession is not reality, right?

23
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.960
Like he was able to convince people that, you know, COVID-19,

24
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.690
we're rounding the corner and I handled it well, you know,

25
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.190
this is the best economy I've done.

26
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.350
I had the best economy and the best for black people,

27
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:24.960
I'm the best about you and them, the best for women. Um,

28
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.610
he was able to convince them of that.

29
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.590
And what that means is that the Republican party may not even if Trump loses the

30
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.840
Republican party is not going to just, you know,

31
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.940
wash their hands of Trumpism. Right. In a way that Joe Biden, I think,

32
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:43.650
was hoping something in that Andrew Yang said, um, to me before, is that,

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.120
you know, Trump during the primary,

34
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.920
that there are some of the people running,

35
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:53.310
I think he was talking about Joe Biden that think that president Trump is like,

36
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.120
um, uh, an interlude, right? Like he is, he is,

37
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.990
he is a symptom of the profits of phase. Right? Exactly.

38
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.840
And that is clearly not the case, right?

39
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:08.070
Like if there had been this huge repudiation around the country, um,

40
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.380
and huge numbers of president Trump,

41
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.460
if all of the early vote wasn't just to Joe Biden,

42
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.440
that's what we would have been saying, but that's not the case.

43
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:20.940
And I think how this country wrestles with that is going to be fascinating and

44
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:24.660
scary for a lot of people for, for, for, you know, at least maybe a decade.

45
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:25.494
I think.

46
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.870
<v 1>I feel like your predictions were probably pretty close to Zach and I used to be</v>

47
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.910
on terms, but I'm curious, really curious as to, you know,

48
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.280
what, um, you know,

49
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.680
there was one or many predictions going into election night that you were

50
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.290
personally surprised by seeing as an outcome.

51
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.910
<v 0>Yeah. I'm surprised about Georgia.</v>

52
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.670
Georgia is still really close in a way that I really,

53
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:53.180
I just never believed that, um, you know,

54
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.520
Democrats were going to be able to really play there.

55
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.920
And I think they are showing that something's happening in Georgia, Florida.

56
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.810
The Latino vote in Florida is really surprising Miami, Miami, hello,

57
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.370
the underperforming by Joe Biden, there is surprising to us.

58
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:13.990
And also I think can super concerning for Democrats moving forward because there

59
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:15.340
have ever since, you know,

60
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.240
ever since he was the general election candidate that Joe Biden, um,

61
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.860
and the nominee though, you talked to Democrats and 40 tux and Latino activists,

62
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.440
and they say he needs to focus on Latinos a lot more.

63
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.620
He needs to focus on Latinos a lot more and they didn't really take that

64
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.470
seriously. They started to do that toward the end,

65
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.370
but it was clearly not enough. Right. And that is something that, you know,

66
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:40.540
you look at the people that were at the DNC, um, them Castro,

67
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.160
not there, you know what I mean?

68
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.510
Like people that huge Latino names were not a part of that

69
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.570
process and a part of that pageantry and that matters.

70
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:52.930
And I think it showed that it mattered in Florida more than Democrats thought it

71
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:56.860
was important. There were so many.

72
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.250
<v 2>The only way I can explain them to just be S media narratives that came out of</v>

73
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.130
the, the hype up this election and I'll get political credit.

74
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:09.030
They weren't fueling the fire anywhere near as much as some of maybe the

75
00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:12.930
broadcast networks and things like that. Um, but we all got wrapped up in it,

76
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.930
um, and self included, but it was, um, in some, in some ways,

77
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:20.640
but there were narratives like Texas is in play and I was in

78
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:25.470
play and South Carolina is in play and the narratives were fueling these, uh,

79
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.790
frankly down-ballot candidates too. Um, and there were like, look,

80
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:30.601
Jamie Harrison,

81
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:34.170
who's the guy who was running against Lindsay Graham raised more money than he

82
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:36.330
could ever more than we did on the presidential campaign.

83
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:41.160
And we raised a lot and there were polls showing him close to

84
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.660
Thomas winning and then like literally could not have been further from the

85
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:49.290
truth. Like they called it on election night, um, pretty early. So.

86
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.840
<v 0>What, what.</v>

87
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.800
<v 2>Is the media missing, um, from your angle? You know what I'm saying? Like,</v>

88
00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:58.860
what is it polling? Is it headlines that clickbait what's driving this?

89
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.600
<v 0>I, you know, the,</v>

90
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.100
I, I'm lucky to work at political, a place that doesn't, you know, some,

91
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.420
you know, we don't always get it right.

92
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.350
Even I know that there's not that I'm going to come to him by and then click

93
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:17.430
baity things. Um, but there is so much,

94
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.200
the media issue is that we are obsessed with the drama. We are drama Queens.

95
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.090
We are messy people who love drama.

96
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.410
That is like at the core of what it seems like is driving a lot of the media

97
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.920
narrative and the media conversation is that, you know, um,

98
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.540
we take one thing, one poll, a couple of polls happening in one state.

99
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.540
And we pull that out to me like, Oh my God, the election is,

100
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.930
the election is not even close. This is going to be a blowout. Um,

101
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.590
it's dangerous. It is, you know,

102
00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:51.570
at times really it's disconcerting for democracy because

103
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.310
if there isn't a media that can understand the people, right? Like if there's,

104
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.360
isn't a back and understand how people are feeling in this country,

105
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.350
we're kind of screwed. Right. I think that we, I think more times than not,

106
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:07.100
we get it, we are correct. Right. Like I think all the reporters I know,

107
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:09.680
and the more I'm in this business, the more I get to meet him,

108
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.950
the bigger names I know that feels like a brag. It kind of is a humblebrag.

109
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:17.820
I guess I get to meet, I get to meet you at the same thing. Yeah.

110
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.210
Like you meet more important people who have been doing this for a really long

111
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.710
time. And so I,

112
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.230
I have never met a reporter that like just likes the drama,

113
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.750
like the drama or isn't, doesn't take this part of their job really seriously.

114
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:34.190
Right. Understanding the American people. Um, and that's key.

115
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.540
And I think that part is what we're losing. The polling industry is doing. Uh,

116
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.660
I'm going to get in trouble for this one as a public industry.

117
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:46.070
Sometimes it's doing a better job of kind of explaining what they got wrong.

118
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.540
They kind of getting things. Right. And so, um, in 2016,

119
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.770
a lot of the surprise that we had was that there was, you know,

120
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:56.960
they didn't wait for education in this country.

121
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.190
And if you were someone who was watching 2016, as much as I was as a reporter,

122
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.720
you could tell that something was happening with people without white people,

123
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:07.250
without a college degree. Right. That,

124
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:10.400
that was something that was happening with president Trump and that.

125
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.570
And so doing that, understanding the different demographics,

126
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:18.680
understanding that Latinos are not a monolith that black people are not a

127
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:21.380
monolith Asian-Americans are not a monolith. Um,

128
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.070
it's going to take more money and more resources in a way that, you know,

129
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.490
in this media environment where there's still, there's only so much money,

130
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:32.510
right. And there's only so much you only ways to make money. Um,

131
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.560
that investment is going to be really intense and should be really intense over

132
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:40.370
the next years to kind of figure out what's going on in this country,

133
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:41.204
because we are out an,

134
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.650
it feels like we're at an inflection point in this country and which I don't

135
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:49.760
think, you know, many of the reports I haven't seen, I'm 31. Um,

136
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.220
and that most reporters I've talked to, who've been doing this for much longer.

137
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:53.054
I haven't seen either.

138
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.600
Um, or go ahead, Eric, if you're going to say some, sorry.

139
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.090
<v 1>No, I, I think that, I think that's excellent insight and, you know,</v>

140
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.420
kind of thinking about, uh, a couple of things directly, um,

141
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.250
that we've had a chance to kind of review, uh, over your reporting.

142
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.830
You talked about, uh, the black vote, um,

143
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.790
and both Trump and buying, getting it wrong. Um, you know,

144
00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:21.220
in terms of race in this election, you know, obviously,

145
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.170
and Zach has mentioned this as well in terms of folks talking about, uh,

146
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.980
the democratic side and using Trump, being racist, uh, as a narrative,

147
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.680
it didn't really seem to stick. And we looked at the map here. And what,

148
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.630
just kind of curious about some of your thoughts on that.

149
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.560
<v 0>Yeah. I think the thing that, um,</v>

150
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.030
Democrats do Republicans do, um,

151
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.020
in elections is they hope that one message works for everyone that looks

152
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:51.340
similar. Um, they hold these that way easier.

153
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.820
If you spend less money and, you know, on a, on a kind of cynical level,

154
00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:57.210
like that makes sense. Right. Um,

155
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.610
and you in this country where we have the socioeconomic

156
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:06.210
status of people being so huge and the way they see and think about the world,

157
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.180
um, where they live, the kind of access to healthcare, their access to, um,

158
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.940
you know, discretionary spending, those kinds of things.

159
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.790
You're getting a split in a lot of places, right?

160
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:21.120
Like obviously Trump was never going to win the black vote.

161
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.830
But if the only argument to black people is Donald Trump is a

162
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.590
racist. You're not going to win that. Right.

163
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:32.880
Like I talked to a lot of black people throughout the year, um, who,

164
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.990
what I kept hearing, um, whether they were activists or just like normal people,

165
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.070
um, was that, yeah, white people are racist. You know what I mean? Like that,

166
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.940
they just like, think that. And so it's like, okay, so if everybody's racist,

167
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.630
why would I go vote for anybody? And so you have Joe Biden who,

168
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.190
the author of the 1994 crime bill that disproportionately impacted black men in

169
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:57.180
this country. Um, you know, you have, so, you know,

170
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.840
even this year when he was kind of, you know,

171
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.680
remembering the good old days in the Senate where he worked with segregation,

172
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.370
if you like name checks, some people who had terrible views about black people,

173
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.760
these are things like if you put those two candidates up against each other,

174
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.670
there are black people in this country who are, I've talked to,

175
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.800
there's a lot of reporting on this though. They're like, yeah,

176
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:18.870
you're all kind of the same. You know what I mean?

177
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.420
So you have to give them something else.

178
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.660
You have to give them something that is, um, you know,

179
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:27.270
what are you going to do for me? How do you make it better? And I think,

180
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.870
you know, we started seeing like ice cube one little Wayne,

181
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.910
like kind of coming out very strange way. Look. Um,

182
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.280
but the thing that's really the funniest one,

183
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.800
just watching that frenzy about around that proved that the

184
00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:47.510
media and Democrats see black people as a democratic. When would you think,

185
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.100
why would we think little Wayne or ice cube are Democrats?

186
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.910
They have never told us we don't know that. And so like, they were like,

187
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.000
Oh my God, why is little Wayne with Donald Trump? Right.

188
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.310
Maybe he's a Republican. We don't know. He also can't vote because he's a felon.

189
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.420
You know what I mean? So like, I actually don't know. And so there's this,

190
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.420
there, there are all of these, um,

191
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.770
our personal biases and unders misunderstanding of, um,

192
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.750
groups of people that feed into all of this and it pops up. Um, and,

193
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.980
and Twitter is the worst.

194
00:11:18.981 --> 00:11:21.500
Like Twitter is the place where all of that is happening the most, you know,

195
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:24.230
it's just like, it is a cesspool of,

196
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.380
of an echo chamber of an echo chamber of an echo chamber.

197
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:30.200
Like most Americans aren't on there. Um,

198
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.760
and I think that's Democrats, you talked about like, you know,

199
00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:38.600
them getting excited about Texas or Georgia and all of those things that happen,

200
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.940
but a lot on Twitter, right? Like that,

201
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.490
and you allow Twitter to run your campaign.

202
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.890
You're kind of screwed because that's not where like,

203
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.010
real Americans are quote unquote real Americans. But I mean, like, you know,

204
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.950
like the average Americans, not right Hillary, the Hillary campaign,

205
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.340
one of the criticisms there was that they were too much listening to the echo

206
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:01.840
chamber. It seems like the Joe Biden campaign did not, has not done that. Right.

207
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:03.970
We'll see how the numbers shake out,

208
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.830
but it looks like they played a game that was based on what they knew to be

209
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.050
true. Right. The Midwest was important.

210
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.560
He had a chance in Arizona in a way that Democrats haven't had in a very long

211
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:18.610
time, um, and ignored. He didn't go to Texas. They sent comma hair.

212
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:21.370
It's kind of in the last days, um, he did not go to Texas.

213
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:23.740
They spent a lot more money in Georgia. You know what I mean,

214
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.600
than Democrats have before. Um, but they, they weren't trying,

215
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.210
they weren't concentrating so much on expanding the map,

216
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.370
just using pipe dreams that Democrats have on how humongous States like

217
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:39.850
Texas would go just off of demographics.

218
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:44.110
Because just looking at demographics, you don't know how voters are going to.

219
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.750
