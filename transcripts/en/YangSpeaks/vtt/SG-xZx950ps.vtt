1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>So let's go through some of the negative consequences of not having</v>

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:06.960
local journalism and you just cited a few.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.150
So I just want them to think about this.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.990
Like some people listening to this right now are like, okay,

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.540
my local paper is gone. No one's covering high school sports,

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.910
cry me a river who really cares. Uh, you know,

7
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:24.300
I can get everything I need on Facebook, the internet, blah, blah, blah.

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.430
You know, like the.

9
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.230
<v 1>Or like I have too much news to read, like, what are you saying? Like,</v>

10
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.870
I'm so overwhelmed with the news. I want less news.

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.040
Not more news is I think like a reasonable position that people take too.

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.680
<v 0>Yeah. So, so that's what a lot of people are thinking.</v>

13
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.930
So here's what we're going to tell them. Elizabeth,

14
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.840
why should they care about not having a local paper in

15
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.840
1300 plus communities around the country right now?

16
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.510
<v 1>Yeah, 2000 newspapers closed since 2004. Um, we should,</v>

17
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.500
we should care because first of all, our government,

18
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.240
our local government is going to be more corrupt in the absence of local news.

19
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:09.980
Like whether you're reading it or not somebody who being the watchdog, um,

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.380
makes a big difference period.

21
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.290
<v 0>I can share an anecdote and you probably have dozens of,</v>

22
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.000
but a colleague who is a city Councilman told me that they ran city council

23
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.920
meetings and a reporter showed up and then the newspaper ran out of money

24
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.650
and the reporter no longer was there. And he said,

25
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.270
all of a sudden things became very different and not good,

26
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:36.920
different, uh, sort of sloppy and unprofessional and, uh,

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.630
kind of corrupt different. Um, so th that's a government.

28
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.770
<v 1>Corrupt is not really the bar we're going for for American government.</v>

29
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.330
<v 0>Uh, so number one, worst local government, uh,</v>

30
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.830
number two.

31
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

32
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.890
More polarized partisanship in our country where we're,

33
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.210
um, subscribing to this like national religious, uh,

34
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.630
approach to having our politics,

35
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:09.020
which is basically tearing us apart from our community.

36
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.850
So there's studies that show the absence of local news increases

37
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.290
polarization and decreases people who vote across party lines.

38
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.770
<v 0>And this makes intuitive sense to everyone because if you don't get any local</v>

39
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:25.670
news, then you're just going to be tuning into Fox or MSNBC or wherever.

40
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:29.000
And then I, you just vote along party lines and that's it. Uh,

41
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.730
and th there's nothing really to, um,

42
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.460
balanced that or adulterated in any way. Uh, so one more corruption,

43
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.330
two more polarization, which is not exactly what we need right now, America,

44
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:45.560
we don't need any more polarization. This is not a good, good thing. Uh,

45
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.603
number three.

46
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.600
<v 1>Number three is, um, the, the more local news we have,</v>

47
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:53.630
the more civic engagement we have and that's like,

48
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.790
that's critical. I mean, we're, you know, we're entering a period,

49
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:00.220
we're through a period.

50
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.870
That's going to have generational consequences for the could be look really

51
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:09.220
dark, or I hope look like communities coming together,

52
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:13.930
rolling up their sleeves and finding real solutions to the nightmare that we're

53
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.980
living in that bring people together. And you know, more people vote,

54
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.270
more people run for office. More people participate in school board, um,

55
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.140
activities when there's local news. And when you don't know about it,

56
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.510
how the hell are you going to participate in it?

57
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.210
<v 0>Yes. Uh, people run for office last, they vote less.</v>

58
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.460
They don't know what's going on. I got to say,

59
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.770
it's harder to care about something.

60
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.730
If you feel like other people aren't going to care or see it either.

61
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.370
You know what I mean? Like, like if you see it in the town paper,

62
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:48.540
then all of a sudden you're like, Ooh, uh, school, board elections, Ooh,

63
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.560
city council elections or whatever it is. Um, but,

64
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.540
but if it's just happening in the dark, then you're like, ah,

65
00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:56.760
I must not be important. Uh we're, we're pretty simple. That way.

66
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.690
<v 1>That's so true. Like the tribal is the tribe thing.</v>

67
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:04.110
Like we have at our school board debates that we,

68
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.790
we hold that it wouldn't exist if we didn't hold them, that Chalkbeat holds, um,

69
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.030
you know, like it's a cool event. It's like a place to be.

70
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:14.700
It's a thing to do with your evening. That's really fun.

71
00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:19.530
And hundreds and hundreds of people come and we get students to co

72
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:23.790
moderate them. I mean, you can make civic engagement fun.

73
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:28.050
And I feel like we've never had a better opportunity to do that than we have

74
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.520
right now in our country.

75
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:34.410
Like every single person is asking these questions of themselves. I think like,

76
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.070
what is my police department all about? You know.

77
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.670
<v 0>What I want people to reflect on right now is that the national climate is</v>

78
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:45.300
obviously very dark and bleak. Um, but then one counter argument,

79
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:48.210
because Americans are programmed for counter-arguments at this point,

80
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.860
it would be like, Oh, um, it's okay. Cause communities will step up.

81
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.860
Things will be better in like your town, you know, like,

82
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.590
so what of DC doesn't have its act together? Like, you know,

83
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:03.510
that the city council will, uh, pay attention to the most important things. Um,

84
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.000
it's a very hard argument to make. If you don't have any local news,

85
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.200
you don't have anyone actually covering what's going on in city government.

86
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.950
There are numbers that show that the corruption argument actually has real

87
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:17.190
monetary costs where the cost of municipal bonds goes up.

88
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:20.130
If you don't have local news, because then they're just like, ah, whatever,

89
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:23.010
let's just like pay whatever bond rate. Um, maybe the,

90
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:25.380
the they'll take a little bit of backscratching.

91
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.960
<v 1>It's been like a boom time for researchers who care about local news and</v>

92
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:35.550
democracy because there's so many natural experiments unfolding over the last 15

93
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:36.000
years,

94
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.890
given that some communities have managed to hold on to some semblance of

95
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.610
people showing up to municipal meetings and school board meetings and city

96
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.850
council meetings, and some just have zero, zero people.

97
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:51.960
And so those kinds of studies are like amazing.

98
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.920
And they wouldn't have been.

99
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.760
<v 0>America, the new land of natural experiments.</v>

100
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.780
It could be our new billing. Let's just see what happens if you have none of it.

101
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.330
Um, so, so Chalkbeat, um, so cool,

102
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.310
uh, helping fill the gap for local education, uh, reporting, uh,

103
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.840
and then the American journalism project tries to take it another step,

104
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.960
which you co-founded a little bit later, uh,

105
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.260
and that's championing nonprofit, local journalism,

106
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.270
business models in communities around the country.

107
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.360
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Um, so, uh, we, you know, I,</v>

108
00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:35.770
I I've seen the way that this movie could play out if we're lucky.

109
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:39.550
Like we, when we, when you say, okay, what's the, what's the math here?

110
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.960
How much money do we need to spend that we're not currently spending to do

111
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.890
we need, um,

112
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.360
it's it's between one and $3 billion a year. Um, and it's.

113
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.540
<v 0>Very low Elizabeth. I don't believe your estimate. It's too low.</v>

114
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.100
<v 1>No, you should believe my estimate. Um, Oh my gosh,</v>

115
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:02.050
you should believe my estimate. It's, it's,

116
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.490
it's low enough that we can do it first of all, but it's, it's grounded in, um,

117
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.680
good thinking. Like we, we don't need to recreate restaurant coverage locally.

118
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.960
We don't need to recreate classified ads.

119
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.750
We don't need to recreate the weather report,

120
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.490
but there's a core civic function that for decades, um,

121
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.410
there's been like a tiny little group of very well-meaning and public policy

122
00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:27.490
analysts are saying, okay,

123
00:07:27.491 --> 00:07:30.910
what are the critical information needs that do exist?

124
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:32.500
And how can we size them?

125
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.250
<v 0>It's a fascinating convo. So I guess we're shifting in this direction,</v>

126
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:40.120
which is great, cause this is what we're where my head's been anyway. Uh,

127
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:44.590
so if you look at the lost revenue among all

128
00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:48.970
newspapers, uh, it's in the $20 billion range,

129
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.050
uh,

130
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.260
now you certainly don't need 20 billion to replace all this because of what you

131
00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:56.080
just said. Like you're not trying to recreate newspaper circa

132
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.520
1988 or something like read that horoscope. Uh, uh,

133
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.590
so, so, so it's clearly a much lower than 20 billion,

134
00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:10.090
but one to 3 billion seems so reasonable. Uh, you know, I feel like,

135
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:14.050
and you're demonstrating how it can be done because you're serving a number of

136
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:17.680
communities. Uh, it sounds like very efficiently. Um,

137
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.270
so the American journalism project has been trying to fill that one to

138
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:23.350
$3 billion gap.

139
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.150
<v 1>Exactly. So, okay. How do we feel it? Um, and as you say,</v>

140
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:29.380
it's a reasonable number.

141
00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:33.690
That's the size of many kind of public sectors that already exist.

142
00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:38.650
Like dance is as a nearly $1 billion sector, public broadcasting,

143
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.060
a billion dollar sector that it's, it's a small amount of money, um,

144
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.600
really in the scope of things. And we have more than enough Atlanta.

145
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.310
<v 0>It's a very, very small price to pay for functioning democracy and</v>

146
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.490
continued civilization. Yes.

147
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.240
<v 1>Um, yes, I think so too. And, and I,</v>

148
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.740
so like how do you pay it the fastest way possible is the question that has been

149
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:07.890
keeping me up at night and when Trump was elected,

150
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.690
I like so many people was really called to say, okay,

151
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.440
what I'm concerned about our democracy in a way that I wasn't concerned a year

152
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:21.150
ago and what am I going to do about that? And I thought about it and said,

153
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:21.600
okay,

154
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.550
I need to activate philanthropy in a bigger way than I've done so far.

155
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:29.400
What does that look like? I mean, and it's pretty simple.

156
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:34.050
I think it looks like activating great leaders to build new

157
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:38.430
institutions of the future and activating philanthropy to support them to do it

158
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:42.930
as at least the first mover. Um, it doesn't have to be only philanthropy.

159
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.130
And, and yes,

160
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:47.580
I know it's not the best situation that we don't just have like free,

161
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:52.530
independent money growing on trees that allows people to be totally pure because

162
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:55.500
that doesn't exist. We ha philanthropy is not perfect,

163
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:59.850
but it's the best we've got. And so we've got to, we've got to assemble it.

164
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.620
We've got to deploy it to really smart causes. And so that's where, um,

165
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.320
the idea for the American journalism project came from we,

166
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.240
we are on a path to we're close to raising $50 million. Um, and then,

167
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.300
and we've been giving it away as our first fund, um,

168
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.400
to promising social entrepreneurs in the local news space and, and,

169
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.300
you know, organizations like Chalkbeat that CA that are positioned to scale.
