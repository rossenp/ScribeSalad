1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>Well, how the heck do you get a job as the white house photographer?</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.800
It seems like there are so many photographers, uh, throughout the country,

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.100
um, and, uh, you know, photo journalism.

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:12.360
It's something that makes me really sad.

5
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:16.680
And I'd love to talk to you about this too, where I feel like as a field, um,

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.660
uh, it's shrinking, uh,

7
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:23.190
in large part because so many of these newspapers are folding in that, uh,

8
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:27.300
the newspapers would be the primary employment magazines to the print magazines.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.970
Um, so before we get into kind of the future of photo journalism, how did you,

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.950
uh, develop, uh,

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.570
and then wind up with maybe the highest profile photo journalist gig in the

12
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.404
world?

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.080
<v 1>Well, I mean, let me preface this by saying that given where we are today,</v>

14
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:49.850
which is, um, you know, not long after Joe Biden has been elected.

15
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:54.290
I see a lot of people reaching out to me saying I want to be Joe Biden's

16
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:59.210
photographer. And, you know, in my response to them is I try to be blunt.

17
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.950
If, if Joe Biden doesn't know you now,

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.020
he's not going to hire you. You know? I mean,

19
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:10.010
there's these out of campaigns photographers in the last few years, you know,

20
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.020
that that's the guy that's likely to get the job for me. Uh, I just,

21
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:17.900
by sheer coincidence, these things happened in life.

22
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.510
I was working for the Chicago Tribune. I was based in DC and Washington.

23
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.430
So when Barack Obama was elected to the Senate in 2004, uh,

24
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.300
Jeff Zelena,

25
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.080
who was then a reporter with the Washington Bureau of the Tribune G and I

26
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.380
documented Obama's first year in the Senate,

27
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.320
and I got access that nobody else got,

28
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.760
because that was with their quote unquote hometown newspapers.

29
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.830
So I got to know him on a professional, uh, you know,

30
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:50.600
just in a professional way, but he also got a chance to see how I worked,

31
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.500
you know, which is, you know, I like to say I worked me, you know,

32
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:58.940
a small footprint and try not to interfere with what's going on. Um, and, and,

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.840
and, you know, and he saw that I took my job seriously. So, you know,

34
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:06.710
skip ahead to four years, he gets elected president and asked me to, you know,

35
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.040
to be as white house apart. So that's the way it happened for me.

36
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.570
<v 0>I'd imagine there were campaign photographs being taken all the time. That was,</v>

37
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.130
so that was not you, or that was you.

38
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.340
<v 1>2007 Is when he started the campaign.</v>

39
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.300
This was started actually in February of 2007, pretty, pretty early.

40
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.760
And I covered probably the first three months of the campaign. And then I quit.

41
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.520
I quit it's a trip Tribune because I thought they had just been bought by a real

42
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:39.020
estate magnet. And I didn't like the direction the newspaper was going.

43
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.210
I was, uh, you know, I,

44
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.110
I just didn't think that I could stomach it anymore.

45
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.550
And even though I sort of had the inside track to covering this campaign,

46
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:53.270
I just could not see myself working for the, the trip unit anymore.

47
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.680
And I ended up taking a, uh,

48
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.680
a teaching job photojournalism teaching job at Ohio university.

49
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.780
Um, and then I would occasionally as a freelancer, uh,

50
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.110
hooked up with him on the campaign trail. Um,

51
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.630
so I sort of kept my foot in the door a little bit.

52
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.160
<v 0>And then he wins in 2008. Uh, and then you get the word, Hey,</v>

53
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.620
come back to DC and, uh, um,

54
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.030
become the white house photographer that must've been quite a call. Was it from,

55
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.790
uh, Barack himself or was it from someone on his team?

56
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.190
<v 1>You know, Gibbs was, um,</v>

57
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.570
kind of my main contact with Obama and, you know, and Robert Gibbs,

58
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.830
a lot of people, you know, just think of him as the press secretary,

59
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.730
but gives was one of the most influential Bates.

60
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.680
He was really like sort of a senior advisor, uh, as well as the press secretary.

61
00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:51.570
So he w he was the one who called me on behalf of the president of legs.

62
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.280
He called me the night before classes for the winter quarter were,

63
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.160
we're supposed to begin and on a Sunday night. And so the following morning,

64
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:02.730
Monday,

65
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.470
I walked into my boss at Ohio university and told him that I was

66
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.030
leaving that afternoon for DC. I was quitting my job.

67
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.190
I kind of have given them a heads up, this might happen, but, you know,

68
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.670
you never know until, until you get that call. So.

69
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.080
<v 0>And you proceeded to spend eight years as the white house</v>

70
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.800
photographer. Uh, so I mean, obviously you had spent a lot of time in DC,

71
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.620
so you're very familiar with the environment. Um,

72
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.140
but coming into the white house, um,

73
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.090
that must have been an incredible journey where you

74
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.590
must've felt like you were documenting history essentially every day

75
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.240
for, uh, for eight years. Um,

76
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.120
what was that adjustment like? Um,

77
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.710
and the other question I'd have is it seems completely physically impossible to

78
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:58.830
me for any one human to cover everything that happened in the white house.

79
00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.360
So this was that like a whole team of you.

80
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.370
<v 1>Yeah, I had a staff, um, but my, my approach going in was,</v>

81
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.780
um, that I was going to be all in to every day,

82
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.970
because my attitude was, if you were going to document for history,

83
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.780
you a, you can't predict when history is going to happen, you know,

84
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:23.010
you don't guess you don't always get noticed. Um,

85
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.610
but then also, uh, in terms of the target fee, you know,

86
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:30.810
I know the fleeting moments, little moments,

87
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.960
the way he interacts with certain people, uh,

88
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.080
if you're not there all the time, you're,

89
00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:38.850
you're definitely not going to make that picture.

90
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.550
And so I wanted to make sure that I was all there all the time to

91
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:47.490
make those fleeing moments, cause I didn't ever want to miss any.

92
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.470
So now sort of the way I approached, uh, the job and I, I,

93
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.460
you know, I knew what I was in for. Uh, I don't think my wife knew with us,

94
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.820
um, because you know, you kind of put your personal life on hold for, you know,

95
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:06.320
in my case for eight years. But, um, you know, I,

96
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.550
I did have a staff,

97
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:11.690
so don't feel sorry for me because I could have easily

98
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.020
taken a day off here and there. But, uh, you know,

99
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.610
my attitude was just always be there.

100
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.280
<v 0>So when does the day start and end for you in that situation? Like,</v>

101
00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:23.980
I feel like you'd want to live near the white house just to be able to get

102
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:24.814
there.

103
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.890
<v 1>I didn't live that far 15, 20 minutes away.</v>

104
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.060
And, um, I would try to get there, you know,

105
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:38.350
one of the things that we have to worry about is staffers that he,

106
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.620
he doesn't really have to worry about his, you know, you gotta commute,

107
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.080
you gotta get there. Whereas his commute was, you know,

108
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.940
two minutes walk residents too. So,

109
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.300
but I will try to get there at least an hour before him. Uh, he would,

110
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.740
he would come down to the oval office sometime between nine and 10 in the

111
00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:00.400
morning. Uh, so I tried to get there, you know,

112
00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:04.690
about an hour before I did have responsibilities as the head of my office.

113
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.620
And I would try to deal with those either early in the morning or at the end of

114
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:12.940
the day. And then I would basically tag along with him, um,

115
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.710
all day long until he went home for dinner. And, um, you know,

116
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:21.100
and sometimes after dinner he would come back to the West wing or there'd be,

117
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.130
um, events, uh, you know,

118
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:27.970
on the state floor or outside of DC that he would go to at night.

119
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.180
And so, you know, every day was a little different,

120
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:35.080
but pretty much I would just tag along with him, you know,

121
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:39.040
at least 10 hours a day, sometimes 15, sometimes longer.

122
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.360
<v 0>So you you're documenting him. People like me come in and people like me,</v>

123
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:47.860
you don't really remember. Cause, uh, I met president Obama, uh,

124
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.220
let's say three or four times, something like that. Um,

125
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.330
either in a group or in a collective setting and you were joking that like by

126
00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:57.310
the six picture, you might recognize someone again.

127
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.230
Um, I did get a picture every time I met him, which was kind of nice. It's like,

128
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.730
it's just, you're around him. They're all,

129
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.420
there were always these photographers trying to capture the moment. Um, so,

130
00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:13.030
and you don't even realize it when you're the guest at that moment.

131
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.770
And so then you just get the photo later and you're like incredible, um,

132
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.640
all the bike stages, uh, immortalized. Um, now, uh, you,

133
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:27.100
you probably have all sorts of, um, crazy experiences and recollections.

134
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.980
Was there anything that you're able to share about an experience where you were

135
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:31.600
like, wow, that just happened for me.

136
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.511
<v 1>A lot of the,</v>

137
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:37.210
the wild moments were not necessarily like the

138
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:41.670
big event, but more, um, the, the,

139
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:46.420
those moments that I talked about, those little moments, which really, um,

140
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.280
define him as a human being, you know, I mean, I just,

141
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:55.800
this is just a for instance, I mean, Ben Rhodes, um, who, you know,

142
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.130
was a deputy national security advisor and his daughter,

143
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:03.000
he CA he came in with his daughter like around Halloween time one year,

144
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.120
and she was just learning to crawl.

145
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.520
And so Obama gets down on the rug of the oval

146
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:16.320
office, squats down and gets Ella to, to crawl to him.

147
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.940
And then he lies down on his back and he's lifting her up. And, you know,

148
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:22.320
those moments are just like,

149
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.700
I can't believe this is happening as I'm photographing this. Um, you know,

150
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:31.500
certainly the bin Laden raid and big historic events

151
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:34.410
like that obviously are also wow.

152
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.000
And a kind of different way where you sort of really feel the weight

153
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.310
of history, uh, taking place right in front of you. Um,

154
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.070
so, um, but you know, I mean,

155
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.930
it's like one of the things that was advantageous about being a seasoned

156
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.880
photographer photojournalist is I was sort of able

157
00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:00.840
to, to keep my emotions in check, you know,

158
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.940
and not get so, um, high, if you will,

159
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.160
when, when these, uh, when these big moments are happening. So, you know,

160
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:15.690
