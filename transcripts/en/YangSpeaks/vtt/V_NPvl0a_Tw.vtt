WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>One thing I campaigned on was that it's</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.641
unconscionable,

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:09.240
that higher education has gone two and a half times more expensive over the last

4
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.150
number of years. And one of the jokes I used to pose was like,

5
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:14.520
has it gotten two and a half times better? And that always got a laugh.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.010
Cause people were like, it has not really gone two and a half times better.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
And then I pose the question to the folks in the audience and was like, Hey,

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.090
why has it gotten so expensive? And then they think about it for a minute.

9
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:28.230
And then I say, did we hire lots of professors? And they're like, no, you know,

10
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.470
did we build lots of new buildings? And they were like, maybe.

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.610
And then I say that the real driver is the fact that we've hired

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.560
150% more non faculty administrators, uh, at these universities,

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.090
they become these like overgrown, uh, bureaucracies themselves.

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.830
And it's become this hidden tax on people on the middle-class on folks who are

15
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:54.210
trying to, to, uh, give their kids a better life. Uh,

16
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.900
and that's been building up for decades in part because any,

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.070
any college every year just looks around and says, okay,

18
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:06.210
how much are we going to increase our prices by this year? And so you have this,

19
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.010
this inflationary effect that's unique to healthcare and education.

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.890
And then family has felt like they had no choice but to pay.

21
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.760
So then the government said, don't worry about it. We've got you.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.410
Here's some loans. So when we're now up to 1.6 trillion in student loan debt,

23
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.950
and I love the fact that you work for NYU,

24
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.990
but you're honest about the fact that look,

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.610
these university administrators have very clear financial incentives like

26
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710
foregoing $400 million in tuition is like, uh, you know, like it, it,

27
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.520
it would wreck, um, many of these institutions.

28
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:45.570
And so you have many schools that are bravely putting up, uh,

29
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.360
signals saying, well, Hey, we're going to reconvene in the fall.

30
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.130
And then you look at it and say like,

31
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.180
is this what you would do if this wasn't like an existential problem for your

32
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:58.620
school to forgo a tuition revenue for a semester.

33
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.480
And I would love to hear your ideas on how we can somehow help the

34
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:08.310
university system become more

35
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:12.030
cost-conscious and invest in things that will actually improve kids' educational

36
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.290
outcomes, as opposed to their us news and world report rankings.

37
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.020
<v 1>We are definitely brothers from another mother. I mean, we, we, your summary,</v>

38
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.740
it took me two years to get to the, to the summary.

39
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:28.280
You just articulated in about three minutes, but look,

40
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:32.840
we live in a capitalist society and having more money means more opportunity for

41
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:37.010
your kids access to better healthcare access, to a broader selection of mates.

42
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.180
It's just a wonderful thing to have more versus less money in a capitalist

43
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:41.811
society.

44
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:46.490
And all of us fall victim to that in the sense that when it's your

45
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:49.040
first and foremost, going to fix your own oxygen mask.

46
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:53.000
And there's the belief that universities are these very noble institutions where

47
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.640
we wear cardigans, watch PBS and pet our Labrador.

48
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.380
And don't think about money and professors and administrators want the same

49
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.270
economic security as everyone else.

50
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.620
So by a combination of this dictum or this gestalt,

51
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:07.990
where everybody has to get a college education,

52
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.720
where we constrained supply and become luxury brands,

53
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.220
as opposed to public servants,

54
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.920
we consistently have been able to raise prices through this kind of cartel.

55
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.920
As you mentioned, twice as fast as inflation.

56
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.440
And we justify that we're doing it for the right reasons,

57
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.960
but the reality is many universities,

58
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.280
especially elite in universities have become hedge funds that provide classes to

59
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:31.720
the children of their investors.

60
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.310
And then we wipe Vaseline over the lens of the caste structure that has been

61
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.080
that higher education has become by letting in some freakishly remarkable

62
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.100
middle-class and lower income kids and to try and make ourselves kind of the

63
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.780
Neosporin of our guilt. This is it's, it's, it's morally corrupt.

64
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.760
And it is, it is the spring used to be a time of nervousness,

65
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.370
but excitement about where your kid was going to college.

66
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.890
Now it's become a despair and anxiety around.

67
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.180
How do I tell my little girl that Ana fireman

68
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:09.270
salary, and maybe, I mean, my wife is,

69
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.760
my wife is a doctor, a nurse that we can't afford to send her to Tulane.

70
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.220
How do you have that conversation? How do you,

71
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.300
how do you feel like you're failing the American dream?

72
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.980
Because you can't afford after working your off to income and you can't afford

73
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:28.710
to send, or you make a worst decision, and that is your kid.

74
00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:32.730
Doesn't get into the top school because they take pride in rejecting nine out of

75
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.470
10 applicants and worst.

76
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:37.890
Yet they go to a second tier school where they don't get nearly the upside

77
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:41.850
because corporations still look at those universities in terms of evaluating

78
00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:43.980
your currency in the marketplace and how much they're going to pay you,

79
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.390
but you incur elite university level debt. It just,

80
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.530
this is one of the most, in my opinion, ugly parts of our society right now.

81
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:55.680
And it's happened incrementally because like anyone else, university,

82
00:04:55.681 --> 00:05:00.000
administrators and professors want to live the same great life as anyone else.

83
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.930
What do we do about it? I've been spending a lot of time with chancellor block,

84
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:06.030
who is the chancellor of the,

85
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.630
of my Alma mater the receives more applications than any university in the

86
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:11.790
world. And that's the university of California Los Angeles.

87
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.690
And I've come to the conclusion that these institutions are almost

88
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:20.370
constitutionally incapable of cutting costs between

89
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:24.090
tenure, between the Rolex suffocation of their facilities.

90
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.090
It is very hard for them and they haven't had to cut costs for 40 years.

91
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.340
It's almost impossible.

92
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:33.120
What we could do is through a mix of small and big tech,

93
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.630
potentially potentially dramatically expand capacity.

94
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.840
If you were to take 50% of your courses online,

95
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:42.060
and there are a lot of courses that would be fine online,

96
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:45.600
or a lot of sessions where there isn't a lot of interaction that you could

97
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:48.690
facilitate online. If you take half your classes online,

98
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.410
you effectively Andrew double the size of the campus.

99
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.590
So what I would like to see and what I would hope, individuals like you,

100
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:58.550
that might serve in a cabinet or be in a position of,

101
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.450
of authority and power someday as could we have some sort of grand bargain where

102
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:04.790
we go to governor's, let's go to governor Newsome and say,

103
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.730
increase the university of California budget by 20%.

104
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.500
And we're going to dramatically decrease the cost per student

105
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:15.860
educated through the use of small and big tech by expanding our capacity.

106
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.390
And we're going to take UCLA back from a 13% admin rate to where it was in the

107
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.640
nineties, 20 or 25.

108
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.510
We have to dramatically expand our land grant,

109
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.260
public universities capacity, such that we can take good,

110
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.560
maybe not remarkable. I mean, I don't know where you went to school. I was an,

111
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.690
a remarkably unremarkable kid.

112
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:40.280
And the reason I'm here speaking to you today is because UCLA led in a third of

113
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:41.270
its applicants.

114
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.260
And they could say to the son of a single immigrant mother who lived and died,

115
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.120
his secretary, let's be honest. You're not great, but we like your profile.

116
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:53.150
You're a son of a mayor of California. We're going to let you in.

117
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.070
They don't have the luxury of doing that. Now.

118
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.370
They don't have the luxury of letting in kids with remarkable futures.

119
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:00.080
They have to only let in the remarkable.

120
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:04.760
So I think it's about dramatically expanding through the use of technology,

121
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:05.660
freshmen seats,

122
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:10.010
and also breaking this wheel where academics and

123
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:13.730
administrators have become drunk on exclusivity. Andrew, every year,

124
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.140
the deans of the top schools,

125
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:19.010
including mine get up and boasts that we rejected 88% of our applicants.

126
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:21.380
That's tantamount to the head of a housing shelter,

127
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.880
bragging that he or she turned away nine and 10 people who showed up last night,

128
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:29.600
we have lost the script. We need to move back to being public servants,

129
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.280
as opposed to luxury brands.

130
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:35.990
And we need to embrace technology and have almost like a Marshall Marshall

131
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.850
act like feel such that we take capacity for our great

132
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.990
public systems, university of Texas, Michigan university of California,

133
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.370
Cal state, CUNY,

134
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.260
Florida state systems and drummer and expand their seats by 30 or

135
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:54.050
50%. I think a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.

136
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.770
I think there's an opportunity here to move back to where we were,

137
00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:01.370
where kids who are unremarkable have remarkable opportunities through the upward

138
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.800
lubricant that is higher ed.

139
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.200
<v 0>Like we, we need to examine this from soup to nuts. Like you look at it and say,</v>

140
00:08:08.201 --> 00:08:11.680
okay, why is it four years? Why does it cost this much?

141
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.510
And to your point, like, why are you getting rewarded for turning people down?

142
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:18.130
Like, aren't you supposed to be a public good.

143
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.820
I love the fact that you've identified public universities as the place to

144
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.840
launch this from, because it makes the most sense. And,

145
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.480
and they should be growing their seats.

146
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:32.770
Like instead of a proportion of people you reject,

147
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.770
it should be looking up society wide and saying, okay,

148
00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:40.060
how many 18 year olds do we think are like approximately,

149
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.190
uh, the right fit for what we're going for in terms of a public education.

150
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.010
And then you should be rewarded for educating a higher proportion of those

151
00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:50.950
people, which is like the reverse of the way they get rewarded. Now,

152
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.480
if I'm in position to do this man, I'm a hundred percent going to do.

153
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.780
<v 1>Yeah. I like it. It comes down to a basic theme in, in a, in a shift in mindset.</v>

154
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.830
And that is the, the worth of a society.

155
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.720
Isn't the opportunities that offers.

156
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:10.020
It's remarkable that it feels to me like the United States.

157
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.610
And I'm curious to get your has moved from how do we give our truly remarkable,

158
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:19.020
remarkable being people who are born with tremendous opportunities and also are

159
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:23.970
tremendously skilled in everyone says NYU is a place for rich kids.

160
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.320
Yeah. But it's also rich kids who are super impressive. They're remarkable.

161
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.780
Do we just continue to follow more and more of the spoils to that small segment

162
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:36.750
who are both blessed, cause they're born into wealth and be very good,

163
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:40.980
remarkable, or isn't the judge of a society or the worth of his society.

164
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.040
What kind of opportunities it gives to its unremarkable?

165
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:48.090
What kind of opportunities it gives to the kid who maybe doesn't have access to

166
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:49.830
the test prep that you were offering,

167
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.750
who maybe has had challenges at home who maybe doesn't at the age of 15,

168
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:58.590
doesn't have a patent and isn't building Wells in Africa and isn't captain of

169
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:02.580
the lacrosse team. I mean, the kids that now get into these schools,

170
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.470
we're basically saying that the two,

171
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.580
the two cohorts that are going to divide the spoils of American productivity

172
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:10.710
wages have not gone up productivity,

173
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.400
skyrocketed that's trillions of dollars in surplus wealth.

174
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.050
That all goes to two cohorts.

175
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:19.680
That's the children of rich kids or people who are freakishly remarkable between

176
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:24.450
the ages of 15 and 17 who get into Harvard. We talk about these elite schools.

177
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:25.260
The reason we talk,

178
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.760
I talk about the state schools is the IVs are more spectacle than historic.

179
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:32.580
They educate, they have 64,000 total students.

180
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.690
Ohio state has 55,000 Florida state has 75,000 Berkeley will

181
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.500
graduate more kids from a low-income household this year than the entire Ivy

182
00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:43.170
league combined. So the Ivy league look fine.

183
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.030
You're you're great leaders produce leaders children's of rich kids and

184
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:50.340
remarkable kids from middle and lower income households.

185
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.070
But we're on America changes where men are Rekha,

186
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.630
fundamentally changes is these land grant public schools that educate two

187
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:00.060
thirds, two thirds of our students.

188
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:04.080
And we're going to need some sort of real dramatic rethinking.

189
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:07.890
I think this is your platform. I think UBI and education.

190
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.460
I think these are the two legs of the stool. I don't know what the third one is.

191
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.500
Andrew for your next run.

192
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.440
<v 0>You have to say health care. Everyone.</v>

193
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.720
You have to say health because healthcare has some of the similar problems.

194
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.280
