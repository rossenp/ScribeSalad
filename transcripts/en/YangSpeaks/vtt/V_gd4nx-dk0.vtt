1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>It it's a devastating time and it's hard to do anything,</v>

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:09.000
but be heartbroken over what happened to George Floyd

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.510
and his family. You know, the,

4
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:17.010
one of my hopes that rise out of this protests is that there's like a

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.840
set of changes that people demand because the danger is that

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.580
all of this energy and heart and spirit and passion

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.060
ends up getting channeled, but like no one knows what to do.

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.360
So we need to fight for something real and concrete.

9
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.340
It's been a devastating and heartbreaking time in our country every night

10
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.380
where either transfixed by what's happening on streets or

11
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:07.760
around the country,

12
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.930
or in some cases were on the streets ourselves. I mean, there,

13
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:15.860
there are curfews that have been

14
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.500
implemented in dozens of cities,

15
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.660
but I saw a report this morning saying that 10,000 people have been arrested in

16
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:26.930
relation to the protests. And, you know, that's a very,

17
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:29.810
very small fraction of the folks who've been marching.

18
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.370
So you're looking at hundreds of thousands of people who've been gathering and

19
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.320
protesting around the country.

20
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.760
I went to a vigil here in upstate New York and hundreds of people came out

21
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.300
and we also, what happened to George Floyd,

22
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:46.700
having his life extinguished before our eyes.

23
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.270
It's like how many people are killed by police every year.

24
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.390
And the sick part is you don't know that it's

25
00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:59.270
unclear how many people die, uh,

26
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.240
in encounters with police or in police custody every year,

27
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:07.040
because the data's not reported despite the fact that a law was passed that,

28
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.330
uh, asked the department of justice to compile this report.

29
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.500
Um, but they just never have gotten the data because it's dependent upon police

30
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.120
departments submitting.

31
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.560
And so you have 18,000 police departments around the country. Uh,

32
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.360
and the best estimates are that a thousand or

33
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:29.990
more Americans die in contact with police annually

34
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.990
cities spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on

35
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.600
settlements for police brutality cases.

36
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.670
New York city alone spends 300 million a year on direct payments

37
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.240
liability, Chicago, 47 million nationwide.

38
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:50.360
You're looking at about a billion dollars or more annually.

39
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.060
And if you think about what that means, you know,

40
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:56.810
that only a small fraction of the people that actually would have a legitimate

41
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:00.820
case can successfully Sue the city and get a settlement.

42
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.340
So you're looking at billions of dollars, uh, easily,

43
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.920
um, in liability.

44
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.090
And the billion dollars I'm talking about is just direct payouts. It's,

45
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.710
doesn't include lawyer's fees, which we know can be massive or insurance,

46
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.770
which we know can be massive. That's just payouts to people.

47
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.840
That's just payouts directly to families.

48
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.190
So looking at it objectively, you'd have to say, okay,

49
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.370
this is a very significant problem. And you know,

50
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.720
it's a significant problem in part,

51
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.440
because of district attorneys bringing suits against police officers who are

52
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.700
accused of misconduct. But if you look at the incentives of the da,

53
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.740
the da works with police officers hand in hand every single day to make cases.

54
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.720
The last thing they want to do is go to war over some police

55
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.950
misconduct. And it's similar for the local mayor. Like the mayor,

56
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.960
his best friend is likely the police chief and the

57
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:02.530
mayor does not want to go to war with law enforcement in their community,

58
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.980
because there are some of the most powerful constituents in the community.

59
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.830
So you're looking at a massive problem,

60
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.790
the scope of which you don't really even know because we don't have the data.

61
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.590
And we all know if there had not been a video of George Floyd being killed,

62
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.810
it just would have been another unnoticed, um, deaths.

63
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.330
So there's.

64
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.350
<v 2>Frustration, there's anger, there's fear. Yeah.</v>

65
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.350
<v 0>It, but to me and Nicole.</v>

66
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.460
<v 2>Conversations, I've been having,</v>

67
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:36.840
there's a sense of helplessness as you watch this unfold, you know,

68
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:40.290
you wake up every morning and you see another horrific instance.

69
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:42.180
And you're like, what, what can I actually do?

70
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.340
<v 0>Where's the first place we can start as a society to start</v>

71
00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:48.480
fixing this? Well,

72
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:53.220
there are studies that have been done as to what we can do to improve please

73
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:56.640
violence. And, uh, the work that campaigns zero has done,

74
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.510
I find really compelling because it's very, data-driven, uh,

75
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:02.760
one of the leaders there as a data scientist.

76
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.980
And so they have six recommendations that have been proven to work.

77
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.740
And they're not easy because again,

78
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:13.530
you're talking about 18,000 police departments.

79
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.680
But one thing that was on the list was federal oversight.

80
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.180
When the department of justice has investigated police departments,

81
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.920
incidents of police brutality have dropped significantly.

82
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.800
And so one thing I've, uh,

83
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.810
championed is that we should have a new George Floyd police misconduct division

84
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:38.310
of the department of justice that is dedicated to police misconduct issues

85
00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:41.280
around the country. Because if you look at it objectively,

86
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.680
the local law enforcement officials are going to have a very hard time bringing

87
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:49.950
suits against other law enforcement officials in their vicinity.

88
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.050
If you're a good cop or a da or the mayor,

89
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.110
you are thrilled that there is someone who can come in and

90
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.240
administer and prosecute these matters. That's not you because in your case,

91
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.820
like you're picking a fight with someone who's in your backyard.

92
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.860
But if you have the feds come in,

93
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.430
then they can be objective and hold people accountable.

94
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.780
<v 2>You've talked about this task force a lot.</v>

95
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.950
So actually it'd be interesting to see how this would work. So theoretically,

96
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.350
you're the da in Minneapolis.

97
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.070
Would you be the one calling this task force to come in or the, the,

98
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:29.500
this task force seat objectively? And it's like, it's out of your hands.

99
00:06:29.501 --> 00:06:32.740
We make the decision. Like, how does it mechanically? How does this work?

100
00:06:32.741 --> 00:06:33.700
Or how would you want it to work?

101
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.290
<v 0>The, because of we can all see enormous public pressure.</v>

102
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.070
Like the district attorney has brought charges against the four officers

103
00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:42.904
involved, right?

104
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.820
But in the absence of this kind of situation where it's literally in the

105
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:50.040
national spotlight, you'd have the independent investigators who,

106
00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:52.000
who act like the FBI,

107
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.420
where they can be called in by local law enforcement,

108
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:57.670
but they could be called in by local members of the community too.

109
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.140
<v 2>So why don't you talked about data?</v>

110
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:01.520
One of the things we've struggled with is there's not.

111
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.340
<v 0>The data is rough w which is a major problem. And that leads us to number two,</v>

112
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.320
that you need to track complaints,

113
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.540
and you need to keep a database of officers who are fired or disciplined

114
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.400
because right now,

115
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:20.380
what happens is you can fire a bad cop and then they'll leave that town or a

116
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:22.540
state, and then go someplace else and then get rehired.

117
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.630
<v 2>The other piece of this,</v>

118
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.150
or how to deescalate a situation in most of these situations are not inherently.

119
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.160
<v 0>Right?</v>

120
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.810
So there are a range of situations where you call

121
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:39.760
someone and you'd prefer that they show up and resolve the situation in a

122
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.510
non-violent way. And so there, there are two elements to this.

123
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.950
One is trying to train police officers to have a continuum of use of force

124
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.750
where deadly force is the absolute, absolute last resort. But the other thing,

125
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:57.520
which is what I was suggesting is that you could have non police organizations

126
00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:01.120
that are able to respond to emergency calls in Oregon.

127
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:04.780
They have this crisis assistance helping out on the street organization,

128
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.130
where you have crisis workers and mental health providers who can respond to

129
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:13.390
incidents involving homelessness, substance abuse, mental health crises.

130
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.230
And in these situations, you don't need someone showing up like saying, Hey,

131
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.150
like who am I here to pull a gun on?

132
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.540
Like a quarter of police shooting victims are mentally ill.

133
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.470
Majority of mentally ill, people are not violent, are not threatening,

134
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.410
but if you're a police officer and you're in that situation, you're like, well,

135
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:32.350
snap, like the, you know, this person is not listening to anything I'm saying,

136
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.860
you know, halt or I'll I'll shoot. And then the person doesn't halt,

137
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.100
there are a lot of situations where you need help,

138
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.550
but you don't necessarily need police help.

139
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.360
Like you don't think it's like a life or death situation that's going to involve

140
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:47.194
a firearm.

141
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.260
<v 2>Is that related to demilitarizing the police?</v>

142
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:52.060
I know you've had some comments on that too.

143
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.790
And we were talking about one of our colleagues went to protest and he said it

144
00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:56.100
was peaceful. And the cop.

145
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.420
<v 0>Showed up who were also peaceful, but they were decked out in riot gear.</v>

146
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.010
Everybody got on edge, and then it got wild. Oh,

147
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.990
ride gear is not the half of it. Zack mean there's a Pentagon program, uh,

148
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.850
that actually allows the military to send surplus military equipment to

149
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.200
police and Sheriff's departments.

150
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.540
So you have some of these 18,000 police departments around the country that have

151
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.810
tanks and armored vehicles and grenade launchers,

152
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.240
and a military style hardware.

153
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.550
And studies have shown that when you have this military equipment in place,

154
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.430
you use it. And then if you use it,

155
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.340
you're more likely to wind up with, uh,

156
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.920
deaths resulting from police action.

157
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.390
So this Pentagon program, um,

158
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.340
was discontinued by Barack Obama's administration and then

159
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:52.290
was reversed by the Trump administration, which is not surprising.

160
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.860
And so we need to reign this in,

161
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.260
and that makes sense from a human perspective as well.

162
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.680
Like it just putting more people on edge. So when I went to a vigil,

163
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.680
police officers were there, but it was 100% peaceful.

164
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.940
What did it have been different if those police officers had those face masks on

165
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.860
a right gear and like Bess and nightsticks,

166
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.470
it would have given a very different energy. And in many cases,

167
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.120
if you're a protestor showing up, like you're agitated, obviously.

168
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.490
And so if there's a police officer there who let's say is wearing a normal

169
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:29.580
outfit, you can see their face and interact with you like a human.

170
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.740
Then you're more likely to have like a less negative or

171
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:39.000
violent interaction with them than if they're like a faceless military-style

172
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:42.720
looking figure. And I think it's true on both sides.

173
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:47.190
Like I genuinely think if you cover my face with a mask and give me a

174
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:49.620
Baton, like I'm more likely to be an.

175
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.480
Then if you can see my face and I'm looking at UI to I, right,

176
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.590
I'm really interested. And I'm interested in your thoughts on this, on that,

177
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.320
the community aspect of this.

178
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.840
Like what have you seen there as a good solution that could work?

179
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.340
There've been positive examples of community-based policing,

180
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:13.230
where police officers regularly volunteer and spend time in

181
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.550
like rec centers and plain clothes where it's not always just rolling up in the

182
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:20.560
cruiser, like in full uniform. And then you,

183
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.790
you wind up with more trust being developed in both directions.

184
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.910
This episode of yang speaks is brought to you by an outer known.

185
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.190
So I got a couple of things, amount of known,

186
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.630
and I'm a way down where I'm one of them was a pair of jeans because I'm in

187
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:49.010
Florida and it's super hot. And I put these jeans on and they're fantastic.

188
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.950
So checking all the boxes, I've got shirts, I got button down,

189
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.870
I sweaters and now have jeans, Kelly Slater.

190
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 2>Former pro surfer world champion. You've.</v>

191
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.040
<v 0>Done it, but this company is awesome. Yeah. The great thing is that, you know,</v>

192
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:07.390
that these clothes were produced with fair living, wages, factories,

193
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:12.160
safe working conditions. You can actually wear them with a clear conscience.

194
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:14.740
We're in a culture now where you have like these disposable clothing.

195
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.630
I cannot believe how cheap a lot of clothes are. When, when you get out there,

196
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.480
these clothes feel different.

197
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.660
They feel better and you feel better.

do it. It's awesome.

204
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.960
<v 0>So one thing that has not worked at least, uh, demonstrably,</v>

205
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.251
and this is going to paint.

206
00:12:56.251 --> 00:13:00.450
A lot of people is like implicit bias trainings and empathy trainings.

207
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.090
It's like that. If you go in and you say, Oh, you know,

208
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:07.410
we're all biased against certain people. Like you may have developed bias too.

209
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.120
And then you try and see whether that changed behavior. Right.

210
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.730
And they haven't been able to demonstrate that it has,

211
00:13:14.731 --> 00:13:16.020
it doesn't mean that it doesn't work. Right.

212
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.330
But they haven't been able to demonstrate that it does work.

213
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.500
And there's similar.

214
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.830
<v 2>Data on body cameras, right. To know, and body cams.</v>

215
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.610
<v 0>I love body cams because common sense to me, it's like, look,</v>

216
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.750
if I shoot someone in the dead of night, um, and it says me and that person,

217
00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:35.130
I shot, and there's no footage that will be like, Hey, like person attacked me.

218
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.170
You know? And then you don't know,

219
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.930
at least the footage is like another data point.

220
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.300
<v 2>I agree. It's definitely, these things are helpful,</v>

221
00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:45.630
but not necessarily affecting the numbers. Right? Like, like, like I don't have.

222
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.780
<v 0>The illusions that like putting body cams on, on, uh, cops,</v>

223
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:50.970
like all of a sudden, like, you know, all the problems go away.

224
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.130
But I will say that like, you know,

225
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.210
there have been times when you can refer to the footage and you're like, okay,

226
00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:01.290
like, I have a pretty good sense of what happened here. And, you know,

227
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:02.220
you saw the opposite of it.

228
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:07.020
I don't know if you just saw like a police chief was fired in Kentucky and

229
00:14:07.021 --> 00:14:11.910
Louisville because a barbecue restaurant owner was shot

230
00:14:11.911 --> 00:14:15.540
and they didn't have their body cams on. And so like, they looked and said like,

231
00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:19.500
what is going on? Right. So I think that's like a useful standard. It's like,

232
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.980
give people, body cams, say we expect them to be on.

233
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.280
And then if the body cam wasn't on, then you know,

234
00:14:26.281 --> 00:14:28.830
you can start unfortunately like saying like, well,

235
00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:32.580
I think something happened here that shouldn't happen. Particularly if you know,

236
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:35.550
someone has been shot and killed. Um, so,

237
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.730
so the data is inconclusive on body cams,

238
00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:41.940
but I will say like enthusiastically for body cams,

239
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.130
just give them,

240
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.580
especially cause like we hold people in other contexts that standards, we hold.

241
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.160
<v 2>Tellers. Yeah. Bank tellers, call center employees, um.</v>

242
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.040
<v 0>A hotel employees, convenience store. It's like, you know, that,</v>

243
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:59.000
that stuff's getting recorded and police officers it's literally life or death.

244
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.040
So, you know, if you have the capacity to record, I feel like you,

245
00:15:02.041 --> 00:15:05.660
you definitely should. So the two other things that they've shown work,

246
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.260
make sense. Number one, or number four,

247
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:14.120
depending on how you're counting is get rid of the language and

248
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:17.450
police union contracts that limits, uh, officer accountability,

249
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.220
where if an officer is called up on some kind of a complaint or discipline,

250
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.690
these contracts often protect them in various ways.

251
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.350
And if that language gets changed, then complaints go down.

252
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.150
So that's something that's difficult because you have union contracts that are

253
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:39.140
different across the country, but behavior changes.

254
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:41.030
If you change those union rules,

255
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.970
then the other is the thing you were saying before about training,

256
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:49.250
where if police departments have restrictions on

257
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.460
choke holds or certain techniques,

258
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.570
this brings down abuse and fatality rates. Right?

259
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.040
And so this suggests that we should be looking at national standards,

260
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.200
which would go into training.

261
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.390
So you're talking about some of the bureaucracies and protections within police

262
00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:12.290
union contracts. So there was an officer during the Parkland shooting there,

263
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:16.610
one like school cop hid behind his police car and didn't go inside the building

264
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.040
and that officer was fired.

265
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.600
But then I think it was 15 months later after firing him for neglect of duty.

266
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.130
They were forced to hire him back with back-pay

267
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.170
because firing him was a violation of his rights based on the union

268
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:37.820
contract under those pretenses. And so what a prime example of like,

269
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.910
if they want to fire somebody, they, they can't. Yeah. I mean,

270
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.710
if you have a police officer who on the scene and could have prevented a

271
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.300
massive loss of life, that was that officer's job in moment of truth.

272
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:54.500
And if they, you know, shrank from that, then like, if you're a community, like,

273
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:55.580
do you want that officer.

274
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.753
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

275
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:10.510
<v 0>This episode of yang speaks is also brought to you by can't screw it up.</v>

276
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.080
Li I mean, freshly, which is basically idiot, proof cooking.

277
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.600
And essentially the guys, they bring you meals.

278
00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:20.860
And as someone who's screws a lot up his cooking up, I've been loving this.

279
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:24.910
Cause I tried to make shrimp scampi the other night with my family because I'm

280
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:29.140
32 years old living at home in quarantine and it shrimper disaster.

281
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.560
So I'm now using freshly way more often.

282
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.700
And I look like a good chef when I do it. Uh, I feel like a good chef,

283
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.490
so I can't screw it up. Yes. You know,

284
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.190
is I can't screw it up in must be a great product.

285
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.550
I'm sure freshly chefs and nutritionists do all the hard work.

286
00:17:45.551 --> 00:17:48.610
All you do is heat for three minutes and that's dinner.

287
00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:52.080
And that like exactly what I need at this point.

288
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.950
So Joanna was one and a half million satisfied customers skip the shopping and

289
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:03.690
the prepping and the cooking freshly is offering our listeners $40 off

290
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.050
their first two orders at freshly.com/yang.

291
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:12.120
That's freshly.com/yang for $40 off of food.

292
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.920
That's $40 off some food. Can't screw it up. Li uh,

293
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.640
no it's freshly and you'll thank us. And it's delicious.

294
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.600
I think it's clearly fricking wrong that these cops killed a man

295
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.900
while arresting him when it was completely unnecessary.

296
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.790
And it's extremely wrong that our system hasn't been fixed in decades

297
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.180
of knowing these problems exist. And there's there,

298
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.560
there's things our government needs to do.

299
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:45.690
And I think people can hold them accountable or try to,

300
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:48.750
but if you're an average citizen right now, what, what can we do?

301
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:51.810
What would you recommend individual people do to start writing these wrongs?

302
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.510
It's a devastating time and it's hard to do anything,

303
00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:01.770
but be heartbroken over what happened to George Floyd

304
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.210
and his family, but also what's happening around the country.

305
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.770
We all have to do everything we can to help. So if you want to help first,

306
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.560
just trying to help people in your own life and your own situation,

307
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.520
be the best person you can be. Um, take care of yourself.

308
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.720
Like mental health is a crisis on top of a crisis right now. And you know,

309
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:26.610
it doesn't do us any good if we're individually not strong or,

310
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:31.590
or don't have our head on straight in terms of organizations to help,

311
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.400
there are a lot of them. So I don't want to just say like, Oh,

312
00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:36.810
this one or that one,

313
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.850
but some of the organizations that are doing great work in this direction, um,

314
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.730
color of change campaigns,

315
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:48.660
zero mapping, police violence.org.

316
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:54.030
One of the organizations I've found working on what you talked about, Andrew,

317
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:57.600
where you have emergency responders that are not carrying weapons,

318
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.800
responding to certain calls that are ideally non-violent nature.

319
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.190
It's called Whitebird clinic.org. Um, it's based in Oregon,

320
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.340
the David program called cahoots, which stands for crisis assistance,

321
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:11.550
helping out on the streets. It's mobile crisis intervention,

322
00:20:11.551 --> 00:20:15.600
24 seven programs like that to me, should be scaled around the country.

323
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.720
And then the other thing,

324
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:22.860
if you're interested in policy and getting new ideas out there at Berkeley,

325
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.610
chief justice,

326
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:27.270
Earl Warren Institute of law and social policy has done a lot of work on

327
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.580
frankly, community policing and how that works.

328
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:32.940
So that's the Earl Warren into the law and social policy at the university of

329
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:35.400
California, Berkeley. You know, the,

330
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:39.900
one of my hopes that rise onto this protests is that there's like a

331
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.700
set of changes that people demand because the danger is that

332
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.480
all of this energy and heart and spirit and passion

333
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.900
ends up getting channeled, but like no one knows what to do.

334
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.300
So we need to fight for something real and concrete that we can bring to our

335
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:01.690
communities and George Floyd and his family, and say, look, George,

336
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.780
his life and his death brought about tremendous change.

337
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.970
And here are the changes and we can see them all.

338
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:12.340
And that this is a positive turning point in our nation's history because

339
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:16.630
of your brother's sacrifice, your father's sacrifice like the,

340
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:19.360
the obvious one was like, well, you need to arrest, um,

341
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.220
the officers and now they've all been arrested,

342
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:24.910
but we can tell that the protest about something much, much bigger, right?

343
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:30.010
This is the crisis of our time in terms of

344
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.000
racial justice and police brutality.

345
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.820
But there are all of these things that are layered on top of it.

346
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:42.100
The fact is we've set ourselves up by having what Cornell West

347
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:46.540
called failure upon failure upon failure for decades,

348
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.370
where you have an economy that hasn't created a decent way of life for millions

349
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:52.204
of people,

350
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.370
and then a legal system and a police system that has not

351
00:21:57.371 --> 00:22:01.870
protected people's rights, particularly people of color. And, you know,

352
00:22:01.871 --> 00:22:05.080
one thing I don't mind being is like the guy who is still talking about the

353
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:08.880
economy when no one else is because the economy is still like underpinning all

354
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.250
this stuff. Like we had another 2 million unemployed, you know what I mean?

355
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.330
Yeah,

356
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.980
right now we're adding fuel to the fire because there's this backdrop of

357
00:22:17.981 --> 00:22:22.360
need and desperation, that's rising. We're at depression,

358
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.580
era levels of unemployment. Uh, people are protesting and riding on the streets.

359
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:31.000
Like the minimum you can do is safeguard people's material wellbeing.

360
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.290
We need to move very fast on universal basic income.

361
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.970
Because right now a quarter of the nation's workforce is out of work.

362
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:44.980
I've seen surveys between 66 and 80% of Americans agree that we should have cash

363
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:45.940
relief. During this time,

364
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:50.350
we're going to be digging out of this economic

365
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.630
catastrophe for years.

366
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.560
And we need to start right now and put people in a position where they feel like

367
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:59.470
their futures are secure. Right. But that said,

368
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.180
I think people misunderstand you some times,

369
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.540
like you are by no means saying that the money will cure everything.

370
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.250
It will help a lot. But if you give people money,

371
00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:09.580
they're still going to have massive injustice in us, in the police system. Yeah,

372
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:14.110
of course. Uh, I mean the money is not gonna give George Floyd's family.

373
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.040
Like they're not, it's not going to turn. People's loved ones to them.

374
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:28.373
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

375
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.890
<v 0>All right. This episode of yang speaks is brought to you by Skillshare,</v>

376
00:23:34.891 --> 00:23:39.600
which I think is essentially the way we're going to educate in the future.

377
00:23:39.601 --> 00:23:43.560
So if you want to learn anything from Phil in video, graphic design,

378
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.490
or time management or mental health practices,

379
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.950
they have online classes and how to actually tangibly learn these skills on your

380
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:55.430
own at your own time, and then apply them to your career, your life,

381
00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.230
your family, whatever you think is helpful, drawing, writing,

382
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:04.430
and journaling classes to help you manage stress during this time

383
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.110
interior design, if you're trying to redecorate or rearrange your, your space,

<v 1>Flashy.</v>

397
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.710
<v 0>So I'm going to recap, just make sure we're aligned.</v>

398
00:25:08.711 --> 00:25:10.480
If you're listening to this and you want to help.

399
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.740
I think my best thing to do is call your Congressman or Congresswoman in your

400
00:25:14.741 --> 00:25:16.330
area or your district call your Senator.

401
00:25:16.331 --> 00:25:19.270
And here's the things you should ask for. And I, Andrew,

402
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.110
make sure I get these right one cash relief, universal basic income.

403
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.980
Let's put out the massive unemployment fire and financial scarcity.

404
00:25:26.981 --> 00:25:30.160
That's fueling a lot of desperation in our communities.

405
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.320
Two is federal oversight and a federal task force three is better training

406
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.221
for officers,

407
00:25:36.221 --> 00:25:40.810
which includes community policing and not using choke holds and

408
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.770
nonviolent responses to emergency calls for is better data.

409
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.340
And making sure we track this and we know exactly what we're measuring and what

410
00:25:48.341 --> 00:25:50.920
we're trying to solve for. And then lastly,

411
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:56.140
five would be loosening up these extremely strict bureaucratic union

412
00:25:56.141 --> 00:25:58.600
contracts that are preventing our institutions from acting.

413
00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.140
Those are the five I have. I miss anything are there. There's,

414
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.320
there's the big six demilitarization, ah,

415
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.390
freak in tanks and grenade launchers out of the hands of police departments

416
00:26:10.391 --> 00:26:14.770
around the country that should be serving and protecting and not treating it

417
00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:16.120
like a war zone. Right?

418
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:22.030
So hopefully this is a helpful way to act for you listening to

419
00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:23.050
this. Um,

420
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.830
hopefully you feel there's there's causes that release or types of organizations

421
00:26:26.831 --> 00:26:31.600
to start looking for to help. We are all about solutions because to me,

422
00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:34.840
what we, the worst outcome is that we have these protests over and over,

423
00:26:34.841 --> 00:26:38.590
and then nothing happens. That's, that's the worst outcome, I believe. And,

424
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.770
or just keep this, this several actions, these Carroll actions keep happening.

425
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.730
Yeah. So w we to make real changes in our society,

426
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:48.210
and we need to present a vision for what those changes must be,

427
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.860
and then make them real,

428
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.700
keep pressure on our leaders until they become law.

429
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.200
And people will know that George's life and his death

430
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.110
change the course of history in this country for the better.

431
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:12.260
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>
