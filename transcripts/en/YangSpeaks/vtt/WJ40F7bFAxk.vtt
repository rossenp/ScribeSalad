00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>The politics of hate is the business model of cable television is</v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:08.880
the business model of digital platforms and it's incredibly profitable.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.950
It just happens to be incredibly destructive for the capacity of a democracy to

4
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:14.940
do anything. Um,

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.590
and yet that is the reality that we see in the way media operates.

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.240
It's the reality around fundraising. I mean,

7
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.030
the fact is if you've got to raise money, the old fashioned way,

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.130
the most reliable technique you've got is the politics of hate to sort of gin up

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.700
hatred to the other side, make it seem like they're the devil.

10
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.900
If they have any power at all, it'll be the end of the Republic. Um,

11
00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:38.730
and that drives the passion to get money into your side.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.740
And if we don't find a way to build democracy on top of a platform that doesn't

13
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.740
depend on making us stupid and hate each other,

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.110
we're not going to build a democracy. And, and,

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.400
and I agree it's really important to recognize it's not just campaign finance

16
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:57.060
reform, uh, finance. I mean, that's a symptom of a deeper problem,

17
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.690
but the cable and the digital problem is really profound.

18
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:03.300
And given the first amendment, there's relatively little,

19
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.770
the government can do about it,

20
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.220
but we need to think creatively about how we're going to address that problem,

21
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:09.050
too.

22
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.490
<v 1>I have an idea that I'm trying to develop</v>

23
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.290
around it because to me, so you have, and so let's, let's put a,

24
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.300
let's put people here and then media corporate interests sort of as a

25
00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:25.340
layer between, um,

26
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.880
people and legislators and we'll put legislators on top and then legislators

27
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.820
have their own, uh, messed up incentives. So to me,

28
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:35.450
the media layer is vital because right now we're turning on each other.

29
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:36.770
We're more polarized than ever.

30
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:41.630
A lot of people are losing faith that we can get anything done together,

31
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.530
uh, which is being born out by the facts. You have Congress walking away from,

32
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.350
uh, over recovery act. Uh,

33
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.320
even though it's obvious to all of us that we need to extend benefits.

34
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:56.120
And so the polarization is going to destroy us and the media

35
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:59.150
unfortunately, benefits from that polarization. So what do you do?

36
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.710
So here's my suggestion, your right, that,

37
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.330
uh, we have first amendment protections and no one necessarily wants, um,

38
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.100
folks to be, uh, governing what can, and can't be said in various news outlets.

39
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.230
Um, on the other side,

40
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:19.400
you have over a thousand local newspapers that have gone out of business because

41
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.990
they can't survive. Uh, you know,

42
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:25.970
Craigslist and internet ads have disrupted their, their advertising models.

43
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.210
And so to me, if you want a functioning democracy,

44
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:30.470
you need to have local papers.

45
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.430
And there have been studies that showed that if you don't have any local news

46
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.440
source in your town,

47
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:41.210
then you just vote on very polarized lines and nothing ever gets done is bad for

48
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:44.300
democracy. And when I was going around the country in Iowa, New Hampshire,

49
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.510
in Ohio and everywhere else, they were very passionate about this because they,

50
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.330
they lost their paper and you kind of lose your identity if you don't have a

51
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:53.690
local paper. Um, so step one is to say, look,

52
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.460
local journalism or journalism generally is a public good in a functioning

53
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.280
democracy. And we need a way to,

54
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.020
to pay for it that is not advertising or subscription.

55
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.310
<v 0>Yes. And so why don't you take an Andrew Yang like idea? Um, you know,</v>

56
00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:15.840
you could imagine giving people, uh, uh, journalists and dollars,

57
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.820
um, that they could use to fund their local local papers. Um, I,

58
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:22.230
I completely agree with you. And, you know,

59
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:25.200
one thing we forget is that at the birth of this nation,

60
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.750
the biggest expenditures the government made were expenditures designed to knit

61
00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:33.030
together an infrastructure of information.

62
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.100
The post office was the forefront of that. I mean,

63
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:39.180
now we're trying to starve the post office to defeat that election.

64
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:41.940
But at that time, the post office was the biggest employer.

65
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.260
And the biggest debate was whether they should make newspapers free to

66
00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:51.090
distribute or charge them a tiny little amount, um, to filter out, you know,

67
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:52.350
just junk. Um,

68
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.490
but their commitment to subsidize the production of news and information,

69
00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:58.470
and the spread of information was absolute.

70
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.090
And they realized you couldn't have a nation.

71
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.450
If you didn't have an infrastructure of informed citizens. I mean,

72
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.150
Jefferson's idea here is really powerful and supportive.

73
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.990
And what we've done is we've evolved into a nation where, you know,

74
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:14.940
we've handed over the production of information to these platforms whose

75
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:18.690
incentives have nothing to do with informing us in an,

76
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.000
a balanced and meaningful way their incentives are.

77
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.310
<v 1>To sell ads opposite. Unfortunately. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.180
<v 0>And, and until we change those incentives until that business model has changed,</v>

79
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.810
um, I don't know what we do now. There are alternatives. I mean, this,

80
00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:34.470
this right here, like a plot, a podcast podcast, you know,

81
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.340
I like to think about the, um, you know, the slow food movement,

82
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.250
which basically says, like, if you just cook your food,

83
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.000
there's like this little.

84
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.370
<v 1>Media movement. Yeah. It's the slow.</v>

85
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.590
<v 0>Democracy movements, slow democracy movement.</v>

86
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:50.700
Like if we do democracy in certain places, we can do it well.

87
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:52.440
And if we do it in other places, we do it poorly.

88
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:54.990
So if you do democracy on Twitter or Facebook,

89
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.860
it's no good because you're reacting to the kind of politics of hate.

90
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:02.100
And you're being driven by ad incentives. And all of that is bad.

91
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.840
But if you do politics and like podcasts or a long-form

92
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.870
narrative or town hall environments,

93
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.660
then that's more fixed to us as humans.

94
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:14.580
Like we have a chance to reflect and to think,

95
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.950
and to hear both sides and to get deep on an issue.

96
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.160
And so the question isn't so much, whether we blow up Twitter or Facebook,

97
00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:24.900
the question is how can we channel more of our political attention into places

98
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.930
where the attention span is greater than five seconds? I mean,

99
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:29.580
you must've hit this all the time. You know,

100
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:33.960
UBI is an obvious point once you understand it,

101
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.130
but to understand it, it takes five minutes at least, or maybe 10 minutes.

102
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.690
<v 1>To explain it. And.</v>

103
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.450
<v 0>How many, you know, I mean, you know, I'm a professor. So I,</v>

104
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:46.920
I I'm have the opportunity to force people to listen to me the lecture for an

105
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:47.490
hour.

106
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.970
But if you're out there on the campaign trail and you've got like 30 seconds to

107
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:54.620
make your pitch, how are you going to explain an idea like UBI to,

108
00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:56.010
in a way that people can understand,

109
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.400
but if you can bring them into a place like this,

110
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.220
the podcast where they listened for an hour to a conversation,

111
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.640
then P ordinary people, anybody can come around to understanding it.

112
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:08.510
So the point is not that you need smart people, you need smart environments.

113
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.660
It's not that you need, like PhD's running government.

114
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:15.590
You just need people placed in a context where they have an opportunity to

115
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:19.280
actually understand before you ask them what they want to do.

116
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:21.110
And we could build that environment.

117
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.090
We just have no incentive to build it right now.

118
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.970
<v 1>I'm a big believer in common sense and the judgment of ordinary Americans,</v>

119
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.650
you can go to them and you say, Hey,

120
00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:32.530
if you had a choice between bailing out wall street or homeowners,

121
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.280
which would you choose virtually every normal president would've been like,

122
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.130
let's keep able to home. And, you know,

123
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:43.840
I think that's a superior judgment than the one we actually adopted in Oh eight

124
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.190
Oh nine, again, and again and again.

125
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.620
So I agree with you that you don't need degrees or erudition

126
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:54.130
necessarily. You just need good information and an environment that's actually,

127
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.470
uh, rewarded for providing you information in a way or judgment or

128
00:06:59.471 --> 00:07:01.210
discussion or argument,

129
00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:05.890
like in a way that's a balanced and reasonable and meant to

130
00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:10.540
provide you the tools to participate, uh, in,

131
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:14.890
in your, uh, own democracy. So here's the opportunity maybe,

132
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.200
uh, here's, here's what I figured out.

133
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.950
And this is the big plan I'm going to try and propose, uh, is that,

134
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.330
so all of these local papers have gone out of existence.

135
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.870
We believe that we need to bring them back, I believe,

136
00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:31.120
or support the ones that are hanging on.

137
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.920
And so what you said about journalism dollars is right, is where I'm going. Um,

138
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.680
but the way that we consume information now is so varied that my

139
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.440
thought would be that it would essentially be a micropayment model tied to our

140
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:45.274
attention.

141
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.870
So let's imagine that every us citizen had a

142
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.160
$50 a month that goes to the stuff that they pay attention to.

143
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.390
And so then there's, and, you know, you can't make it complicated for people.

144
00:07:58.391 --> 00:08:03.220
So it's essentially just tied to whatever, uh, article I look at, or if,

145
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.210
if I subscribed to something, you know, I can use some of it on that. Um,

146
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.920
and then we could end up creating like a positive set of supports for some of

147
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:16.780
the journalism that we want, um, without having to go down this road of,

148
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.360
like, you can't say this, you can't say that. In other words,

149
00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:24.190
you reward the positive, uh, without trying to circumscribe,

150
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.030
uh, communications and other sectors, and you make it so that like the,

151
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.860
the unreasonable media is more clearly

152
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:35.110
such. So they'll always say like,

153
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.800
if you've got like the carnival Barker on the side, uh, you know,

154
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:42.310
yelling about things, then you can be like, look, you can yell. Like, you know,

155
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.720
it's, you're right. It's just, you're not going to participate in this, uh,

156
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.490
in this journalism dollars, uh, set of, uh, incentives and rewards.

157
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:52.541
<v 0>Well,</v>

158
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:57.480
so is journalism scholars directed to just the bottom line or is it directed to

159
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.780
certain kinds of activities that we know we can't do anymore? I mean,

160
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.980
like the most important activity journalism used to do was investigative

161
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:06.000
journalism. I mean,

162
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:10.050
the only way to keep local governments honest was for a reporter to show up at

163
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:14.310
city hall meetings, um, or to, you know, go to city hall and talk to people.

164
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.870
And now there are no reporters anymore.

165
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:19.200
So the corruption at the local level is exploding. Um,

166
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.350
so is journalism dollars driven towards, uh,

167
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.320
like supporting particular kinds of journalism or it's just,

168
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.810
we're going to give you money based on the number of eyeballs that you happen to

169
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:28.644
attract?

170
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.750
<v 1>Well, so the initial thought, and part of the reason why I liked the,</v>

171
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:34.850
um,

172
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.900
I like being paid based on your attention is I'm also concerned that we have a

173
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:41.120
creative atmosphere that is, uh,

174
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.470
increasingly impossible for musicians, artists,

175
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.240
uh, of all kinds, uh, as well as journalists.

176
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.500
But I agree with you that there's some fundamental public purpose to journalism.

177
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:59.060
One of the things I suggested on the campaign trail was that we publicly

178
00:09:59.061 --> 00:10:02.900
fund a number of investigative journalists per congressional district,

179
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.850
where the thinking being like, you know, what,

180
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.130
if you have a congressional district,

181
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:08.810
I'm sure there's important stuff going on there.

182
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:13.080
And so you have these journalism fellows that, uh, you could great idea. And,

183
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:13.551
and we had,

184
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:17.060
it was like the same number as like Congressman you get it's federally funded,

185
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.270
they're there. Like you would probably night someone from within the community.

186
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.750
It'd be like this big honor. Um, we essentially have to make journalism this,

187
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.790
uh, publicly valued profession. And I got into this giant, not giant.

188
00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:33.560
It was like a minor Twitter spat this issue where I was like,

189
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:37.700
look, uh, journalism is dying and we need a new model to fix it.

190
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:41.450
And then some journalists took issue with me and said, you know,

191
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.030
journalism's adapting and work during this, the new thing.

192
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.210
And then I just went on this mini diatribe. I was like, look,

193
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.170
thousand plus local papers out of existence. I've been to those towns.

194
00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:54.500
People are, uh, are devastated by their loss.

195
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.420
Every journalism, every journalist knows hundreds or thousands of colleagues.

196
00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:02.060
Who've lost their jobs over this last period of time.

197
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.950
If a young person comes to you and asks about going into the field,

198
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:08.420
you try and scare them off. You're like,

199
00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:12.560
this is not the field you want to go into.

200
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.490
You have major media outlets, like time magazine, um,

201
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.740
or not time. Yeah. Time, uh, being bought by media moguls.

202
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.550
Oh, no, sorry. Tech moguls as like a trophy property, you know, Washington post,

203
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.720
uh, you know, like bought by Bezos. Uh, and so we,

204
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:33.680
we have this market distortion of journalism that is going to make,

205
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:37.790
in my opinion, a functional democracy, impossible to resuscitate.

206
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.220
<v 0>Well, I, I think it's a really important idea for creativity in general.</v>

207
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.020
I don't know if, you know, if, um,

208
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.560
my colleague Terry Fisher who wrote this really wonderful book called promises

209
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:52.280
to keep about copyright and his idea for copyright was, you know,

210
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:56.290
copyright used to be obsessed with controlling copies in the digital age.

211
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:58.060
That makes no sense. Instead,

212
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:00.520
what we gotta do is just make it totally trivially,

213
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:02.770
easy for people to copy things all over the place.

214
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.300
But then artists get paid based on the frequency with which their content gets

215
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:11.080
consumed. So, you know, if you happen to be an incredibly popular artists,

216
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:12.880
like we're tracking, who's consuming what,

217
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.360
and you get paid based on the fact that people want to listen to you 10 times

218
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.610
more than my 11. I never understand that,

219
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:21.070
but that just seems to be the reality of, of music. So,

220
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.300
so that's a way of like encouraging people to create and encouraging the sharing

221
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:28.390
of creativity, but also guaranteeing that artists get paid.

222
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:31.420
And I think that would work for a good chunk of the journalism part.

223
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.930
But I do think that the other idea you were talking about is really critical.

224
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.100
You need journalists who in some sense are not thinking about the bottom line.

225
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.830
I think grapes in the New York times can do,

226
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:44.710
is it can say to a investigative journalist, like take a year,

227
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.860
just think about this for a year. And at the end of it, if we've got something,

228
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:49.270
we got something. If we don't, we don't,

229
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:52.510
but I'm not going to your job is not going to hang on whether you get a Pulitzer

230
00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:54.490
prize winning article at the end.

231
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.920
And so I think these fellowships is a really great idea.

232
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.810
Like pro Publica supports the idea of basically creating effectively fellowships

233
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:03.760
in journalism. We could multiply that.

234
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:06.940
I love the congressional district because you want to really drive it into the

235
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:10.270
local jurisdictions and say like, there are 10 journalists,

236
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:15.100
fellow ProPublica fellows in every district. Um, and then let these people,

237
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.980
you know, be judged locally about whether they're doing good work,

238
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.040
but at least you'd begin to drive attention to an area,

239
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:23.450
which right now there's no return for like, why,

240
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:24.580
why would you ever talk about it?

241
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:25.801
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:30.600
So there are so many things we need to do in the media sector

243
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.500
in particular. It's funny. And you, you were ahead of me on this as well. Uh,

244
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:37.470
you know, your last book talked about a lot of these issues. I kind of lived it.

245
00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:40.890
I lived my version of it,

246
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.470
but I'm convinced, uh,

247
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.580
changing the incentives for media has to be part of the puzzle or part of the

248
00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:49.200
process, because at this point,

249
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.310
people are getting their information in very limited ways.

250
00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:54.870
And when you talk about podcasts too,

251
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:57.630
this is like a thing that I'm very sensitive to.

252
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.420
It's like podcasts, work for folks like you and I that have a following. Um,

253
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.160
but it's, it's not like a real replacement. Like, do I love podcasts? Yes,

254
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:12.990
I do. Uh, you know, obviously we're on it.

255
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.590
Um, and that was one of the things that some folks in the media came back to me

256
00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:20.670
about, uh, where they said like, look like we have these podcasts. Uh,

257
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.900
and I said, well,

258
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:25.020
you have that podcast because you're a big deal journalist and you actually can

259
00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:27.450
get audience, but it's not like the, uh,

260
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:31.770
the format does not replace other forms of journalism.

261
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:34.740
It certainly doesn't replace the investigative journalism you're talking about.

262
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.480
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think it replaces it all I'm trying to think about is like,</v>

263
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:41.330
how do we get, keep, yeah.

264
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.570
How do we get people into the right context for the kind of question we want

265
00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:47.820
them to think about it? I mean, this is, I think what's,

266
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.070
what's interesting here is I just think this is a sort of problem.

267
00:14:50.071 --> 00:14:54.230
We never had to worry about like serious problems were in context where you had

268
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:56.780
serious attention to think about it. You have time to think about it.

269
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.990
And now we've got to make sure that's possible. Instead of like,

270
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:03.140
imagining people are going to make a judgment about who the democratic nominee

271
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:07.790
is going to be, uh, based on their Twitter feed or their Facebook newsfeed. Um,

272
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.690
like how do we get them into a place where they have a better opportunity to

273
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:13.790
think about the range of people? So, you know,

274
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:18.140
you experienced New Hampshire extraordinary context where

275
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.070
people meet people face to face over the course of two years.

276
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:24.980
By the end of that two year period, everybody knew who Andrew Yang was.

277
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:28.730
Everybody knew your character. They didn't know you through your ads on,

278
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.800
I don't know if you had television ads, but they didn't know you.

279
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.610
<v 1>We spent approximately I think it was something like four or 5 million on</v>

280
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.290
TV in New Hampshire alone.

281
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.320
<v 0>That's great, but that's not how they do Hampshire,</v>

282
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.240
but not just because of that.

283
00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:46.600
The point is they could see you face to face and know your character. I mean,

284
00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:49.450
I remember that town hall where, uh, you know,

285
00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:52.840
you appeal to our children and like, what are we leaving our children? And you,

286
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.320
your eyes welled up. And I looked out in the audience and people were weeping.

287
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.220
That was,

288
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.810
that was because New Hampshire puts politics at a personal

289
00:16:01.811 --> 00:16:02.740
retail level.

290
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.790
And so people have a deep understanding of the character because of the place

291
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.290
that they begin to meet them.

292
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.280
And we got to think that way about these problems generally. Like, you know,

293
00:16:12.281 --> 00:16:15.700
it's okay to think about what brand of toothpaste you need to be consuming at

294
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.830
that kind of Twitter level attention span.

295
00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:19.510
Like you don't need to worry about that so much,

296
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.400
but who the next president should be,

297
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:26.080
or like whether you BI should be at the center of any economic plan that takes

298
00:16:26.081 --> 00:16:29.320
real thought. Not that smart thought. It just takes, as you were saying,

299
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.660
common sense thought, but common sense,

300
00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:36.100
driven by people who have an opportunity to understand both sides and to reflect

301
00:16:36.101 --> 00:16:38.380
on it in a way that gives them confidence.

302
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.150
<v 1>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
