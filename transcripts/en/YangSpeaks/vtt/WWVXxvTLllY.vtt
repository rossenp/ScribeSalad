WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>Uh, I'm, uh, an entrepreneur and a practical type for me.</v>

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:08.910
The problem I was trying to solve for seven years was that we weren't creating

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.140
enough new businesses and entrepreneurship and, uh,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.590
business growth and job growth in communities around the country.

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.100
And then I realized that the problems were much bigger and deeper,

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.000
but certainly Andrew Yang in his late twenties was not thinking any of this

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.610
Andrea and his late twenties was just trying to get a deal.

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.180
<v 1>I think what's interesting. And what captured so many,</v>

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.190
so much interest about your candidacy and more was you didn't talk,

10
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.920
you talk about it in terms of the fourth industrial revolution, obviously,

11
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:37.670
you know, we I've,

12
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.250
I've interviewed you in the past and you obviously understand some of the

13
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:42.350
deeper, I mean, obviously you did the math,

14
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.710
but you also spoke about it in a very visceral way.

15
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:50.030
So when you were traveling those places and you're talking to these people,

16
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.790
how do they come through? Like in their stories?

17
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.200
Because something that I've always kind of come to understand is that elite

18
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.220
economists and many others will try to explain phenomenon way by being like, no,

19
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.070
your job has gone, but you you're better off because of X.

20
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.820
And that when you actually talk to real voters and people who have been effected

21
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:11.960
by automation, trade policy, or LOC last loss of manufacturing,

22
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:16.640
they know exactly why they lost their job and the macro force that it kind of

23
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:19.070
brought about. So is that something that you saw,

24
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.330
like whenever you were traveling?

25
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.610
<v 0>Yeah, they did know what happened, particularly in a place like Detroit,</v>

26
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.440
where the urban center emptied out for the most part

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.650
and the population drained away. Uh,

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.600
and they know that it was a combination of globalization and trade deals and

29
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:40.550
offshoring, and also, uh,

30
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.140
the automation of many of their traditional manufacturing jobs. So they know,

31
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.770
uh, and I studied economics.

32
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.280
So I understand the theory behind it, uh, you know, like, Oh,

33
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.320
comparative advantage, you'll be fine. Or, you know,

34
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:57.740
you'll learn how to do something that's higher value add. Uh,

35
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.600
but then you go there and that stuff's just seems farcical. You go there.

36
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.470
Right. Uh,

37
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.270
and there was a disconnect that I struggled with.

38
00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:11.540
And then Trump won in 2016. I started a venture for America in 2011.

39
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.170
So I've been doing that work for five years and then Trump wins and then I'm

40
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:19.920
like, okay, this is much deeper and nastier, and we're still,

41
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.260
we're still not being honest about it somehow. So that, that was what drove me,

42
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.240
but I, I am very interested in trying to figure out the Genesis of my, um,

43
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.540
uh, of my approach in part, because, uh, you know,

44
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.520
I've been an operator and entrepreneur for 20 years or so, uh,

45
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.120
and you know, they're just like facts on the ground that you have to deal with.

46
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.860
And if you tell yourself a nonsense story and you're running a private

47
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:50.300
company, uh, you're going to fail, but like, it's, it's,

48
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.680
you know, it's inevitable. And so, you know,

49
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.500
I like to think I just traffic in, uh,

50
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.340
as close a version of reality is I can find, um, because if,

51
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.780
if you're operating from reality, then you're more likely to be successful.

52
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.530
And one of the frustrations I found soccer is that, like,

53
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.610
there's not a whole lot of trafficking in reality, that's going on right now.

54
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.040
Uh, and it's going to destroy us because we have this increasingly in Kuwait,

55
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.080
uh, set of arguments. Uh, and one thing that someone said to me,

56
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:24.700
it was only as Lessig, um,

57
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.510
who said to me that we live in a [inaudible] right now where I can't get

58
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:31.240
anything done, but I can keep you from getting anything done. Right.

59
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.720
And so there's a lot of negative power going on. Um,

60
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.450
and we're in an era of unprecedented change.

61
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.650
And so if you freeze government and say, no one can get anything done,

62
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:43.390
then you wind up with, uh,

63
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.200
problems that just get bigger and bigger and you become more and more behind the

64
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:48.070
curve and out of date.

65
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.900
<v 1>I think that's a really profound point that you're making there, Andrew,</v>

66
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:52.711
because the,

67
00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:57.300
the main thing that you're observing is that we can stop things from other

68
00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:58.920
getting done. And like I was saying, like,

69
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.600
I generally find the whole shtick about businessman trying to run the country

70
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:06.930
that way as pretty hokey, because it's like, well, no,

71
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:09.330
actually like a nation state is not a business and all that.

72
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.740
But the one thing where I think it absolutely does apply is to your point was is

73
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.680
that if you keep, if you do something, which is totally delusional,

74
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.840
you generally, your business should fail.

75
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.690
Like there should be at least some sort of incentive,

76
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.830
theoretically that's in democracy, like voters should vote you out,

77
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:26.940
if you do fail.

78
00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:30.600
And yet we've kind of come to a system where you have both parties,

79
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:35.430
which are invested very much in an ideology, which has failed, you know,

80
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.320
the fourth industrial revolution as you call it,

81
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:41.550
didn't really just occur out of nowhere. One of the, you know, the deep,

82
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.340
one of the most pernicious things that somebody told me,

83
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.490
I won't name him because he was high level in economics. He said, you know,

84
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.470
I'm unconvinced that the best scenario for Amazon is

85
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:56.400
not 10% unemployment or, you know, PERMA 10 to 15% unemployment.

86
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.300
And the reason being that if you're in a rural or a small town,

87
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.540
that the best pay, the best paying job, so to speak.

88
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:07.440
And really the only option for you is to work in an Amazon warehouse at a very

89
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:09.720
set wage in a, not which is non-unionized.

90
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.610
And there is a level of corporate control there over the way that you're

91
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:18.090
conducting your life. And your, you know, you, you,

92
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.890
your singular option of being able to live that I do think is unacceptable.

93
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.800
How do you, how have you always looked at the monopolization question?

94
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.300
Cause I know you toyed with it, you know,

95
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.490
between tech and then the regular sector too.

96
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.760
<v 0>I don't think we have truly reckoned with what it means to have trillion dollar</v>

97
00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:40.680
companies that dominate so much of our waking

98
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:43.290
life. Uh, you know, and it was to me,

99
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:47.970
a source of great amusement watching these trillion

100
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:51.810
dollar companies pretend to be scrappy startups in front of Congress the other

101
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.080
way, it was like, Oh, you know, we're not number one at all.

102
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.280
We could be appended any day by those tick talkers or whatever. It's like,

103
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:05.270
we wouldn't have crushed Instagram. No, you know, it's like the whole thing.

104
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.680
I'm just like, Ugh. Yeah. Like watching them, uh,

105
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.980
try and recast themselves. Um,

106
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.370
yeah, that, that there are consequences of having companies of that scale, uh,

107
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.480
are unknown to us. Uh, but they're extreme.

108
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.770
And one of the things I kept saying to folks is like, look at this point, um,

109
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.570
Amazon no longer, uh, has to obey the rules of business physics anymore.

110
00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:36.550
It's just like this voracious black hole. Yeah. Uh, you know,

111
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.503
it's,

112
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.980
it could decide not to make money in a given quarter and it would still be a

113
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:45.790
trillion dollar company. You can't compete with them in any meaningful way.

114
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:50.470
They have essentially unlimited resources and

115
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:53.860
access to more data than anyone else. Uh, you know, that like they're,

116
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.790
they'll trumpet the fact that they're hiring tens of thousands of Americans

117
00:06:57.791 --> 00:06:59.170
while, uh,

118
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.040
while retail is shutting down and I mean made light of it earlier about what's

119
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:07.000
going to happen. Uh, and, and so the, the old tool kit would be like, well,

120
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:07.834
break them up.

121
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.620
And I think that there needs to be a breakup of some of these companies in some

122
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.000
verticals. Uh,

123
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.300
but I also don't think that actually solves the problem because you wind up

124
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:20.170
with, uh, still, uh,

125
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.800
these network effects that just advantage whatever company is, uh,

126
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:24.670
is at the hub.

127
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.320
And right now our government is so bad at this where we're essentially 25 years

128
00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:30.071
behind the curve.

129
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:34.210
So any company that's come into existence over the last 25 years? Oh no, no, no.

130
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.440
What you're doing. Uh, and then we have this mistrust of government being like,

131
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:42.940
well, you're slow and behind the times, and they're right. Really smart.

132
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.400
And the times they should decide what to do. Uh, and, uh,

133
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:52.390
and that that's been, um, one of the ways we're conditioned. Uh,

134
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:57.310
so the optimal path would be that we go to each of

135
00:07:57.311 --> 00:08:01.420
the big four or five companies and just say, look,

136
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.800
we have company-specific issues with you trying to apply a one size fits all

137
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.440
antitrust framework doesn't even make sense, right?

138
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.040
Like we're going to have to craft tailored legislation, um,

139
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.450
and figure out what the worst aspects of your enormity

140
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.890
are and then circumscribed them. So in Facebook's case, it might be like, well,

141
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:25.480
what are our biggest beefs with you? Uh, the erosion or, uh,

142
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.610
or near decimation of our democracy, I would say,

143
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.880
would be top of the list. Uh,

144
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:35.140
and then the fact that they sell and resell Austin,

145
00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:38.860
our data for tens of billions of dollars a year might be second.

146
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.740
Then the third might be, uh,

147
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.270
the fact that they have a near monopoly on certain types of social media,

148
00:08:46.271 --> 00:08:48.190
because they did by Instagram and WhatsApp.

149
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:50.650
And so maybe we have to do something about that.

150
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:54.070
And then there might be mental health of our kids associated with Instagram,

151
00:08:54.071 --> 00:08:58.680
use you down the list and just try and figure out what, what each issue is.

152
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.990
Um, like I'm not against size for sizes sake, I'm against size of it ends up,

153
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.960
um, hurting us in various ways.

154
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.340
And then you have to write company specific legislation, um,

155
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.280
for Facebook, essentially, don't pretend it's like,

156
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:17.910
we're going to take out a 20th century framework before the internet even

157
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:21.090
existed back when they're talking about picking,

158
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.580
like this company makes too much steel.

159
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.810
Like it's a very, very different world now.

160
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.050
<v 1>Yeah. I th it's, it's funny, you said I,</v>

161
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.200
what I always loved about your campaign was the feeling that I wasn't living

162
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.150
