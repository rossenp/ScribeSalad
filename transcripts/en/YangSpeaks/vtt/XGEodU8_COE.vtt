00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>Because communication is a physical art form. It needs to be learned physically.</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.840
I have a stack of Lego blocks.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.020
I have a whole little stack of post-it notes here.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.920
And if you work with someone who is a relentless fast talker,

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.190
let me tell you how not to help them say, Hey, listen, Andrew, that was great.

6
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:19.950
You did a great job tonight, but listen, next time, just,

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.400
just talk a little slower. Doesn't help.

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.550
I'm sure you know why that doesn't help cause you're not in your head,

9
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.910
but it doesn't because the person you've not given them anything actionable,

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.570
even more so you're not giving them anything physical or kinesthetic they can

11
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:37.590
hang on to. So instead we often say to people, take a Lego block,

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.540
say one idea at the end of that idea in silence stack this Lego block

13
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:47.220
until it clicks in place with the next one, then pick up another block.

14
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.770
Say the next idea at the end of that idea,

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.300
stack the Lego block again in silence. Next idea. Lego block.

16
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.840
Next idea. Lego block. You can do a post-it notes too.

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.360
They're easier to transport and most folks have post-it notes.

18
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:05.340
But what you're doing there is you're forcing a change in terms of

19
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.860
how their physical communication instrument is working.

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.940
You're giving them almost a muscle interruption because people who relentless

21
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.601
speak quickly,

22
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:16.080
especially in interviews and they feel like I've got to get all the information

23
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:19.560
out as fast as I can. And they begin to stumble over their words because of it.

24
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.260
That's a muscle memory habit. So in fact,

25
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.850
they can even practice forcing themselves to actually insert a pause,

26
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.040
share one idea at a time. And the weird,

27
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.910
cool thing about remote communication and not everything about remote

28
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:33.930
communication is cool.

29
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.610
But one of the things that is good is we actually have this weird little

30
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.580
boundary right here. I call this the cloak of invisibility.

31
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.150
I'm wiggling my hands. I'm still wiggling them. Andrew. Whoa.

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.190
Now I'm moving them still, but they're still wiggling.

33
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.170
So people can actually use kinesthetic training to try to force them to change

34
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.460
some of their habits.

35
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.750
<v 1>Wow. Yeah, they could cheat.</v>

36
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.120
This is some cheating stuff here.

37
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.770
Like I can putting Legos

38
00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:07.160
together with my hands and you can't see it. I'm kidding. I mean,

39
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:10.490
this is actually, I will say I do a lot of zooming,

40
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.290
which is probably not shocking to people right now,

41
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.290
but a lot of the time your hands are not visible.

42
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.030
And so I'm doing stuff like I'll do stuff with my hands. Do not the Lego thing,

43
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.910
but like I'll so I, I love it. Uh,

44
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:26.390
so you can use a physical activity to kind of adjust yourself.

45
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.700
<v 0>Yeah. And it sounds wacky. It's not, it's actually called embodied cognition.</v>

46
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:32.534
So that's a big,

47
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.410
fancy scientific term for it basically means you're learning something by doing,

48
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.680
getting information from your body, not just your brain,

49
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.110
because a lot of the habits that people go into,

50
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.970
they're fundamentally not in control of. They get anxious, they stop breathing.

51
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.230
They stopped breathing.

52
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.520
Their mind gets a bit panicked because their cells on a cellular level are

53
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:56.690
telling your brain you're drowning because no oxygen is coming into the system.

54
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.560
So they feel like I'm drowning. What? That does speed up heart rate.

55
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.770
The heart starts pumping faster. Big muscle groups start getting recruited.

56
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.300
Small muscle groups lock up.

57
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.460
It's like a little bunny rabbit and the headlights of a car.

58
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.850
And then in that state, what they're telling themselves is like,

59
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.400
say something smart, say something smart, say something smart.

60
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.800
And then inevitably they don't. And then they say like, Oh,

61
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.800
you're such an idiot. Why didn't you say a smart thing? So.

62
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.360
<v 1>I said that to myself an awful lot. No, I'm kidding.</v>

63
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.430
Well, what did you say? I mean, I know, I mean,

64
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.450
I've definitely been there many times in my life. Um,

65
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.170
I I'd actually think say one of the biggest things about running for president

66
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:38.970
and adapting was not doing that because I think my natural tendency

67
00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:42.570
earlier in life was to, uh,

68
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.380
Monday morning quarterback, myself or whatnot and be like, Oh,

69
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.730
we should have done this. Should've done that.

70
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.320
One of the things that I had to get better at was essentially

71
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.940
not beating myself up.

72
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.990
<v 0>But it is, it's very related to actually, I mean,</v>

73
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:01.230
in a way this drill I'm talking about right now, it's exact same thing,

74
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.560
which is you're in the middle of some thought you can feel it's going badly.

75
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.670
I'm saying dumb stuff. This is not going well. I'm on a tangent, Oh crap.

76
00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:12.330
Where am I going? But building that muscle memory discipline,

77
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.170
you force yourself to stop, finish that thought.

78
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.010
And you know what, I'm going to start a fresh on this next thought,

79
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.760
because what tends to happen is people hit the gas pedal and things go South.

80
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.240
And then the whole vicious cycle kicks in. So it's actually the same thing,

81
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:30.750
but just on a, almost a sentence by sentence or thought by thought basis,

82
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.630
as opposed to an entire media event when you're on the campaign trail.

83
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.650
<v 1>Um,</v>

84
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.340
are there other examples of physical activities if I've got a different issue?

85
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.880
Yeah.

86
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.910
<v 0>Yeah, for sure. So I got this cork, it's a wine cork.</v>

87
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:45.360
You're going to slice it into slivers. This is the tool that's very old.

88
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:49.080
This idea. This principle goes all the way back to ancient Greece,

89
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.750
an orator named DeMoss, Denise,

90
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:53.490
who would practice speaking with an impediment in his mouth.

91
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.490
And I learned this from the head of voice and speech at the Royal Shakespeare

92
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:58.590
company in London that guide him, Andrew Wade.

93
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.710
When I studied with him at the Guthrie theater in Minnesota. Anyway,

94
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.030
that's the pedigree of it.

95
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:07.680
But all you do is talk with the impediment in between your teeth like that.

96
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.340
Now I have updated this for Corona virus times,

97
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.310
which people don't want to put stuff in their mouth or on their face,

98
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.960
which makes sense, bad idea.

99
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.790
So instead I've been coaching folks to use this because they do put this in

100
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:21.990
their mouth two times a day.

101
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.700
So for the folks who get on zoom calls and they begin to get all mealy mouth and

102
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.920
they stumble over their words and as they do that,

103
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:30.240
they feel bad about what they're saying.

104
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:33.210
So they talk even faster and they close her mouth more as a close her mouth,

105
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.460
more than words come out, even worse.

106
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.180
And they begin to stumble even more as opposed to critiquing yourself

107
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.710
negatively about that and falling all back in that thought suppression trap.

108
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.573
Instead,

109
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.530
I just have to practice freaking with a toothbrush between their teeth

110
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.610
two times a day,

111
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.710
and no warning spit up a toothpaste fractures with a tooth fry for 60

112
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:59.150
seconds. And in the, the same thing, because what you're doing,

113
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.960
just like a swimmer who puts on a couple of extra swimsuits in the practice

114
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:06.110
pool. So they increase the drag and they're faster in the actual meat.

115
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.120
What you're doing is you're making your muscles jobs harder. So these muscles,

116
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.570
they're not used to communicating in a really dynamic, really dexterous,

117
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:18.200
really forceful way. And you're building stronger muscles by doing that.

118
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.300
So that's one that's about enunciation, diction and clarity. That's like.

119
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.370
<v 1>Putting weights on when you're walking or what, uh, wow.</v>

120
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.710
Just restricting your communication muscles. Um,

121
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.850
fascinating. Okay.

122
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.310
<v 0>There's one for what I call linguistic precision. And all that means is,</v>

123
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:41.470
are you saying what you want to be saying or not?

124
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.790
So like lots and lots of people, again, back to thought suppression,

125
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:48.490
they get off the stage. Someone says that was great, but listen, you know,

126
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.740
some staffer comes up to them with a, with a clipboard, they say,

127
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.140
but next time just say a couple fewer ums.

128
00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:55.090
It looked like you were kind of stammering on that one answer.

129
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:58.450
So just try not to say, um, just pause in the stead.

130
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.700
So that sounds like good feedback, right?

131
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.390
Cause you've been given an actionable thing pause instead of saying I'm okay,

132
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:08.830
fine. Does it work? No, because all the person's doing is thinking about the,

133
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.830
um, which by the way, is not actually that big of a deal.

134
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.740
People are weirdly quite forgiving of filler language.

135
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.870
It exists on a bit of a hockey stick curve.

136
00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:20.110
So people don't really notice it until they do. And then once they do,

137
00:07:20.111 --> 00:07:23.860
it becomes more and more problematic, but it's actually pretty forgiving.

138
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.370
So the bigger problem though, is that people get focused on it themselves.

139
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.060
So what they're going to actually play around with is a drill I've created

140
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:32.140
called finger walking.

141
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:36.940
And all people have to do is walk their fingers across their desk or

142
00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:37.540
table,

143
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.160
like so forcing themselves to choose each and every single

144
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:46.210
word that they share, once they've reached the end of one,

145
00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:49.540
thought they can move their hand back to the front of the desk or so,

146
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.480
but not until they've completed that idea.

147
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.310
So the point here is that filler language is not a problem. It's a symptom,

148
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.060
it's a symptom of you not being in as much charge of what you're saying as you

149
00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:02.800
could be. And the problem is not the arm.

150
00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:06.100
The problem is you're not being as precise as you could be with all the other

151
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:08.560
words, but just thinking that is not enough,

152
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.870
the activity of actually using embodied cognition to commit

153
00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:18.430
to each and every single word helps people focus in a physical way on the

154
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.510
language they're choosing,

155
00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:22.330
as opposed to the little filler words they're trying to avoid.

156
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.800
So that's something focused on linguistic precision saying smart stuff,

157
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.260
saying it in a very accurate and precise way.

158
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.620
<v 1>This is something you could do in the zoom era,</v>

159
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.620
because you could do the walking with your fingers,

160
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:39.910
choosing every single word deliberately and just do it on your leg without

161
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.013
anyone seeing.

162
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.680
<v 0>Yeah. And then people will say like, you can't do that in real life.</v>

163
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:46.420
And I'm like, yeah, you can. Yeah, you can,

164
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:49.570
you can do that a few minutes a day and you're going to build muscle memory and

165
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:49.901
you know what?

166
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:53.680
It will be faster than the last 10 years when you've been telling yourself,

167
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.150
like stop saying, um, what I get stop saying, stop saying, stop saying, um,

168
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.480
that didn't work pretend years. So don't do that anymore.

169
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.630
Do this instead a little bit and build some muscle memory.

170
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.770
So those are a couple examples of this approach of kinesthetic learning and

171
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:12.030
embodied cognition to build on the delivery side of things,

172
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:16.080
positive communication habits that help unlock both smart stuff and smart stuff

173
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.010
delivered. Well,

174
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.500
I want to give folks one more tool in terms of a kinesthetic approach to change

175
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:24.060
something, because it can be very valuable.

176
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.350
And I think you might actually have something to share about it because of what

177
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:32.700
it helps people do, which is taking your time before answering questions.

178
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.270
So I often have people keep like a wiffle ball or something like that on the

179
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:39.720
desk. And actually when they get a question asked of them,

180
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.110
roll the ball forward and let it roll back to them.

181
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.370
And then answer the question. Now do that on low consequence calls. I mean,

182
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:49.770
like you're just chit chatting with your friends about stuff,

183
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.680
but you're building the discipline of tolerating.

184
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:56.130
The thinking time it takes to come up with something that you want to share.

185
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.510
I even recommend that people do that even when they don't need it.

186
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.870
So you might get the question in the interview of like, you know,

187
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.060
tell me about your experience in your last job.

188
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.760
And you actually know everything you want to say,

189
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.090
but simply by giving yourself some more latitude,

190
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.100
some more thinking time before you begin,

191
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.090
what you do is you're giving yourself that margin of safety for when you get the

192
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:20.220
question that you really don't know what to say,

193
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.360
because you will have built already a track record of taking your time as you

194
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:25.710
move through these answers.

195
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.360
So that's a little way people can internalize that habit of pausing before you

196
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:31.194
speak.

197
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.910
<v 1>One thing I can say with authority is that whatever timeframe you think you're</v>

198
00:10:34.911 --> 00:10:38.780
pausing, it's actually much, much shorter than that. You know what I mean?

199
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:41.380
So it might that you like you,

200
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.210
like you're pausing for several seconds,

201
00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:47.870
but it's probably significantly less than that. Uh,

202
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.070
it's just when you're in that mode of answering a question,

203
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.770
even a second seems like an eternity.

204
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.900
So you actually can just let that moment breathe and just seem like

205
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:00.734
you're reflecting.

206
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.500
<v 0>They've measured this by the way.</v>

207
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:05.870
I mean speakers in high consequence situations,

208
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.040
they can be off by up to 10 X of what they're, you know,

209
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:12.530
I keep a sticky on my computer here to show clients,

210
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.050
which is this equation right there. And you see that equation.

211
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:16.723
<v 1>P is not R.</v>

212
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.180
<v 0>Yeah. Any guesses on the, the a words.</v>

213
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.160
<v 1>They're not reality is my, there you.</v>

214
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.280
<v 0>Go. Yeah. Perception is not reality and speakers.</v>

215
00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:28.730
Oftentimes in high consequence situations, there'll be off by up to 10 X.

216
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.260
So they think a pause is 10 seconds and it was a one second. And you know,

217
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.750
technology can help in this actually. So like,

218
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.410
if you're going to be interviewing record yourself, talking, look back,

219
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.020
and then actually the little sound wave thing on the voice,

220
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:46.730
a voice memos app will show you notice how long your pauses you're right.

221
00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:50.480
I promise you, it's probably at least three times shorter than you think it is.

222
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.440
Probably.

223
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.200
<v 1>I guess I got used to this on the trail where you can</v>

224
00:11:56.201 --> 00:12:00.880
pause to reflect and you realize that it's only a second and it's

225
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:03.850
completely natural sounding and whatnot. And no,

226
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.140
no one thinks you're just sitting there stressed, trumping your chin whiskers,

227
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:09.580
thinking about it. Yeah.

228
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.650
<v 0>Yeah. But see,</v>

229
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:13.650
that goes back to that initial principle I'm talking about of being other

230
00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:16.920
focused. So like your friend comes to you, your friends in a crisis,

231
00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:18.210
they ask you what to do.

232
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.630
You wouldn't feel some sort of artificial countdown clock of,

233
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.120
I better start talking because otherwise I won't look like I know what I'm

234
00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:27.090
talking about. You would just sit there for a moment, take it,

235
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:32.010
and then begin to share your thoughts as precisely and as helpfully

236
00:12:32.011 --> 00:12:35.460
as you could. Because in that moment, you're thinking about one thing,

237
00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:39.330
which is what should I say to this person right now to help this person.

238
00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:42.630
And that's where that pause would come from a deeply organic place.

239
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.810
Pausing comes from two things, two things alone, one,

240
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.190
you need some time to think about what you want to say next or two.

241
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.390
You want to give the person you're talking to time to digest what you just said.

242
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.880
So it's not as though it's too short or too long.

243
00:12:56.881 --> 00:13:01.380
It is about you actually tolerating the time it takes to figure out what you

244
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:05.490
want to say next. And that simple ball drill is a good way to make it again,

245
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.720
very kinesthetic.

246
00:13:06.721 --> 00:13:11.490
So people actually forced themselves to do it because if they try to

247
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.950
maintain a pause like that, they're not going to do it.

248
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.760
They're going to think they paused for four seconds and it will have been half

249
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:18.594
of a second.

250
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.880
<v 1>Yes. Half of a second, uh, high stakes situations,</v>

251
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.790
interviewer camera in your face, et cetera.

252
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.010
<v 0>I really suggest for people to try to embrace a growth mindset</v>

253
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.000
about communication. You can learn how to pause.

254
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.120
You can learn how to enunciate better.

255
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.750
You can learn how to be more precise with your language, their skills,

256
00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:46.230
just like a sport or a musical instrument that one can practice.

257
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.250
And the reason that's so important is because it puts some power back into the

258
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:54.510
person's hands. It's a skill you can improve. And as you do,

259
00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:58.800
so you'll reap the rewards of doing that. Even just a sense of command of, wow,

260
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.110
I actually am in command of some of these things.

261
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.390
<v 1>As a parent, we know a growth mindset is the key to life. Really? You know,</v>

262
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.700
if your kid's like, Oh, I'm bad at that being like, well, you know,

263
00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:12.330
you can get better because you can get better at just about anything.

264
00:14:12.331 --> 00:14:14.400
If you decide to put some time and energy into it.

265
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.960
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
