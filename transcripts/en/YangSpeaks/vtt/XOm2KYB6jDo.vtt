1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>And now we have the amazing car out East man who was running for Congress, Adam,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.180
Nebraska, second district, which I think includes Omaha. That's right, right.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.330
Welcome. Carl. Welcome. Welcome to yang speaks.

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:15.420
You and I met when I was campaigning in Iowa. Um,

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
because for those of you who aren't geographical experts, Iowa,

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.800
Nebraska touch each other, like right there.

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.420
<v 1>Yes. And I said this then, and I,</v>

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.530
you were the most inspiring political speaker I'd ever heard talk.

9
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:34.010
So thank you for that. It was, it was fun and, you know, politics,

10
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:34.940
isn't always that much fun.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.830
<v 0>Politics is not that much fun, but you've been in the change-making, uh,</v>

12
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.140
line of work for a long time. Um,

13
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.370
you and I bonded over the fact that you also started and ran a nonprofit that

14
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.460
did incredible work in your case. It was a, uh,

15
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.350
children's nonprofit based in Nebraska.

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.460
<v 1>Yep. I was called Omaha healthy kids Alliance. It's still exists,</v>

17
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:59.000
but I no longer there. I was hired to start it in 2006.

18
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.710
And our focus was, uh, originally was eliminating childhood lead poisoning.

19
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.890
And that eventually we grew into a green and healthy housing organization.

20
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.810
<v 0>Well,</v>

21
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.010
your evolution is similar to mine in that you run a nonprofit and you see all

22
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.980
these problems, uh, in our community is, and you think, wow,

23
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.350
someone should really do something about that. And then you're like,

24
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:22.940
I guess it might be me because after you

25
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:27.620
work, uh, as a nonprofit leader, you kind of get a sense as to, uh,

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.570
frankly like the need for different solutions to solve the problems you're

27
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:33.530
tackling every day.

28
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.680
<v 1>That's right. Well, and,</v>

29
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.240
and these are problems that can be fixed if we have,

30
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.850
cause we have the resources to fix them in this country.

31
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.320
We just don't have the political will.

32
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.860
<v 0>Yeah. Well, you're changing that.</v>

33
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:53.630
Tell us about your race in Nebraska for people who don't know that much about

34
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:56.750
it. And also, and you can do this in order. Um,

35
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.510
when did you first hear about universal basic income?

36
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.430
<v 1>Well, um, I heard about it from you on the campaign trail,</v>

37
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.260
so there's that, but um, yeah, it's,

38
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.170
it's an exciting race here in the second district.

39
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.830
All eyes are on us because in 2008, uh,

40
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.670
we gave an electoral college vote to Barack Obama in Nebraska.

41
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:22.550
We split our electoral college votes similar to Maine.

42
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:26.750
And so we have that one that some people are saying could be the deciding

43
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:29.270
electoral college votes, a little terrifying to think about,

44
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:33.980
but could be true and Biden is ahead in the polls and as am I.

45
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:37.040
And so we have a real opportunity to elect the first woman to serve the

46
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:41.000
district. Uh, somebody I'm running against a Trump Republican,

47
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.310
who's voted with him 93% of the time.

48
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.640
And also to give that electoral college vote to get rid of Trump.

49
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.100
<v 0>Well, you are up, it is very hard to beat an incumbent. Tell us more like it,</v>

50
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:55.130
it sounds like has this guy been in Congress for a long time?

51
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.860
<v 1>He's in his second term. And you know,</v>

52
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:02.080
I th I actually ran him in 2018 and came up

53
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.350
1.9% short in one of the closest races in the country.

54
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.090
So we're back again and we've given people four years to see him in action and

55
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.460
he's betrayed the district over and over again.

56
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.370
And they're looking for somebody who's actually going to represent them.

57
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.820
<v 0>Wow, you're going to make that, that the comeback it's like car, the return,</v>

58
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.340
you know, like Rocky too, a little bit like,

59
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.920
like the first race was Rocky one,

60
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.980
we all know what happens at the end of Rocky.

61
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:31.530
Two Rocky wins for those of you who haven't seen it yet.

62
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.560
Uh, one reason why I'm thrilled to get you into Congress is that, uh,

63
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:41.430
you are for cash relief during the pandemic and someone who's worked with

64
00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:43.950
families the way you have, um,

65
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.210
you would be for casually because you understand the good it would do, uh,

66
00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:50.610
in the lives of so many people in your district.

67
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.583
<v 1>That's right.</v>

68
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.390
We have so many politicians in office in

69
00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:02.370
particular on the Republican side who do not seem to understand the

70
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:05.760
needs of regular working people. And that, you know,

71
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.620
most of us are one economic shortfall away from

72
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:13.680
total bankruptcy, total annihilation of our family.

73
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.050
And if that's in the form of hitting a pothole and having your tires blow out,

74
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.830
when you haven't, you don't have the money saved up to actually pay for that,

75
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:26.490
which is challenging to do because it's expensive or getting laid off from your

76
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:26.761
job.

77
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:30.120
And now we see this in the middle of the pandemic where so many people have lost

78
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:33.390
their job and therefore lost their healthcare. So it's,

79
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.880
we need people in Congress who understand this.

80
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.980
We need more working class people in Congress.

81
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.370
The average net worth of a congressperson right now is a million dollars.

82
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.470
We need people who understand this stuff.

83
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.760
And I've had the honor of working in nonprofit organizations for over 20 years.

84
00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:51.000
My worldview is framed by the clients that I've had the honor of serving,

85
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:52.680
and I believe they deserve a voice.

86
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.750
<v 0>So tell us about your race. I mean,</v>

87
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:58.110
you came within a hair's breadth of winning in 2018.

88
00:04:58.111 --> 00:04:59.790
And what are you seeing this time?

89
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.840
<v 1>We're seeing a lot of change with independence in the district about a quarter</v>

90
00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:05.640
of the district are registered independence.

91
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:10.350
We started our campaign this time by knocking doors of independence in 2018,

92
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:14.580
we knocked on 200,000 doors around the entire district.

93
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.960
And so, um,

94
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.320
and what we heard from independence this time was their number one priority was

95
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:21.030
getting Donald Trump out of office.

96
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.490
So when we have a congressperson who has so heavily aligned himself with Trump

97
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.180
and with the Republican party, Nebraskans are pretty independent,

98
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.180
but we have a unicameral we've had, uh,

99
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.870
we've actually been a primary progressive state in the past where we had

100
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:40.470
Democrats as our governor, as our us senators. And,

101
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.030
and I think a lot of people have seen that the Trump administration's failed

102
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:47.370
promises have actually really hurt Nebraska,

103
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:49.710
especially in terms of our agricultural economy.

104
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.810
And especially in terms of that tax bill,

105
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:54.060
which we know was not for regular working people.

106
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 0>I agree with you that independence right now are looking up and saying,</v>

107
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:01.580
we got to turn the page for our country. Trump has to leave.

108
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.010
And I think that's one reason why I am so pumped about your race and

109
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:11.690
other races around the country that, uh, you have a wind at your back. Uh,

110
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.640
this time that I don't think has existed in my recent memory.

111
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.510
Um, so we need to get behind candidates like you and make sure that you,

112
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.403
you went.

113
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.160
<v 1>I agree. Well, and when we look at 2018 people talk about, you know,</v>

114
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.100
the fact that it was great that we flipped the house, but you know,

115
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.000
84% of incumbent Republicans in the house kept their seat.

116
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.490
So I would not describe that as a blue wave,

117
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.720
but I think that we can have that this time expanding the house majority,

118
00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:43.210
flipping the Senate, and obviously flipping the presidency.

119
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.660
<v 0>Uh, the, the I'm optimistic about, uh, your race in many other races, cars.</v>

120
00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:53.230
I think the toughest thing is going to be after you all get to Congress is

121
00:06:53.231 --> 00:06:57.670
trying to get that institution working, um, more efficiently and effectively,

122
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.640
uh, than it has been, uh, in quite some time.

123
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.470
But it starts with getting people like you in having a non-profit leader like

124
00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:09.010
you, uh, who is so close to your community, um,

125
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.990
in Congress trying to craft policy would be such a quantum leap

126
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.800
forward. Uh, and it is funny, like talking to you now,

127
00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:22.660
I think other people might have the same impression, um, because like you said,

128
00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:27.040
most members of Congress at this point are, uh, very affluent. Uh, you know,

129
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:31.030
a lot of them come from, uh, business backgrounds and,

130
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.300
uh, backgrounds where they can plug into like a network of money. Um,

131
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:38.680
and you come from a very different background. It's very,

132
00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:41.560
very grassroots driven. Uh,

133
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.610
the fact that a candidate like you is poised to make a bit of history, uh,

134
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.400
political history. It sounds like in Nebraska, uh,

135
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.490
is such a great sign for 2020. Um,

136
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.960
what would your top legislative priorities be after you get sworn in because

137
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:57.880
you're going to win and you're going to get sworn in 20 times.

138
00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.920
<v 1>Aside from, you know,</v>

139
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:03.790
dealing with the pandemic in a responsible way that actually demonstrates

140
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:07.390
leadership and prevents human lives from being lost. Uh,

141
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.980
my two priorities are healthcare fixing our broken healthcare system.

142
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:14.020
We're going to S we have to start with Loring prescriptions.

143
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:17.500
I'm running because my mother was prescribed a $2,500 pill that she couldn't

144
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:21.010
afford to take. And I want to get money out of politics.

145
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.840
So actually fighting corruption and reforming our system and

146
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.350
doing things to stop the threats to our democracy.

147
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:32.560
I think that that's incredibly important probably now more than ever.

148
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.910
<v 0>So many people agree with you on those priorities. I love them.</v>

149
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.350
It's a economic or a leaf fixing our healthcare system and getting money out of

150
00:08:41.351 --> 00:08:45.760
politics slash tying our politics that people, uh, my proposal, as you know,

151
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:48.760
was give everyone a hundred democracy dollars. Um,

152
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.060
so the goal will be to wash the corporate money out.

153
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.060
So it's not even quite get the money out of politics. It's more like tie the,

154
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.780
to what ordinary people think. Um,

155
00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:00.690
because right now the number of people that donate to political campaigns,

156
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.370
and if you're someone who's donated to a campaign,

157
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:04.380
you should know that puts you in, like the,

158
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.610
like maybe 10% of Americans donate to political campaigns.

159
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:13.200
It's probably risen this cycle. So let's call it 1214, but that's still, um,

160
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.370
highly unusual.

161
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.430
So what can we get that percentage up to if everyone had a hundred thousand

162
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:21.000
dollars and then they said, I like Carra Eastman. You know, I'm going to,

163
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.360
I'm going to get behind her and I've got a hundred democracy dollars to do. So,

164
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.660
like, what percentage do you think we'd get up to if everyone had a hundred free

165
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:28.494
dollars.

166
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.050
<v 1>Upwards of 80%? I mean,</v>

167
00:09:30.051 --> 00:09:32.870
I think people would actually get engaged and get involved. And,

168
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.100
and one of the things that,

169
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.070
that struck me and I don't ever hear anyone talking about this,

170
00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:40.460
so maybe we could, but when I first started running, you know, they tell you,

171
00:09:40.461 --> 00:09:44.570
like go to your friends and family, ask for money. Right. I did that. Like, I,

172
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.840
my friends gave me $50. It's wonderful. Yeah. But like,

173
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.190
what they mean is go to your wealthy friends and family and go to corporate

174
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.350
packs. But when I started looking at the lists of people who donate to Democrats

175
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.760
in our district,

176
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.480
99.9% of those people were white people.

177
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.820
And it was shocking to me that we have so few people of color who give to

178
00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:11.660
political campaigns. So, so drill down that number even more. Right. And,

179
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:14.660
and we know, especially for wealthier donors,

180
00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:18.890
they often get prioritized in my campaign. We, we run on a grassroots campaign.

181
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.370
Our average donation is incredibly low. We have thousands of donors,

182
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.020
but that's not typical.

183
00:10:24.021 --> 00:10:27.710
This is actually pretty different for a district like mine and just different in

184
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:28.190
general,

185
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.070
because it's not just Republicans that have done this it's Democrats as well.

186
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.530
So we need to change the system.

187
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.380
<v 0>Yeah. The numbers are very, very, um, damning in this regard.</v>

188
00:10:39.381 --> 00:10:42.140
So I said, let's say 10% of Americans donate.

189
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:46.370
And those 10% are donating 50 bucks. Cause that's what a normal person would do.

190
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.010
If you drill down to people who donate over $250,

191
00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:55.340
which makes you like a more serious donor that 10% drops quickly to like,

192
00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:59.570
I think it's 1%. So, uh,

193
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.580
and you're looking at the top, uh,

194
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.350
10th of 1% that give like the max of 2,800, um,

195
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.880
in a, in a federal race. Uh, and so when you were given fun fundraising,

196
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.360
uh, direction about running for Congress,

197
00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:18.530
you need to raise 1.6 million on average to be successful. Uh,

198
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.120
and so if you do the math on that, like, uh, it's hard to get there on like,

199
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.790
like 20 bucks. Uh, you know, you need like a lot of people.

200
00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:29.930
So they expect you to go chase down the folks who can give you thousands. Uh,

201
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.010
and that's the game and we need to change the game so that you have more

202
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:36.560
representatives that actually answered, uh, uh,

203
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.440
people that aren't in position to give thousands of dollars.

204
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.260
<v 1>That's right. And you don't,</v>

205
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.670
we shouldn't have candidates or elected officials spending time doing this.

206
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.290
This is not how, I mean,

207
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:52.640
you don't want your congressperson spending six hours a day raising money. Well,

208
00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:54.040
you don't want that. But unfortunately it's.

209
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.000
<v 0>The norm, uh,</v>

210
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.900
Lawrence Lessig cited a study that said that members of Congress been 30 to 70%

211
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:01.720
of their work hours raising money. So that's six hours a day.

212
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.690
That's not an exaggeration, that's not a car. I'm just making it up. I mean,

213
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:08.770
that's real. Uh, so Kara people want to get behind you and help, uh,

214
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.520
push you to victory. Uh, on November 3rd, uh, working, they,

215
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:14.230
they find out about you and how can they help.

216
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.320
<v 1>Uh, Eastman for congress.com on Twitter at Kara, for Congress car,</v>

217
00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:23.850
with a K Facebook at Eastman for Congress or Instagram at Khara for Congress.

218
00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:27.660
And we can use all the help. We need money. We need volunteers.

219
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.750
We need people just to spread the word on social media,

220
00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:31.830
whatever you can do right now.

221
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.270
<v 0>The value that gets generated.</v>

222
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.030
And the last number of days is like a lot of things in life,

223
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.940
or like a lot of the last mile value is the most important.

224
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.620
So it's not too late to help. Carra, uh, Kara Eastman,

225
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.750
Nebraska, second district give help volunteer text bank, phone bank,

226
00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:51.750
and we're going to be in position to celebrate car's victory.

227
00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:54.840
You're going to be such an incredible member of Congress and I am pumped for it.

228
00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:55.860
I'm pumped to be a part of it.

229
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.040
<v 1>Thank you. That means a lot coming from you. I appreciate it.</v>

230
