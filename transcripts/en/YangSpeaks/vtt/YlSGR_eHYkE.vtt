1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>What seemed to me to, to resonate, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.150
around you with folks that I did not expect visit,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.510
you really never seem to dislike anybody on the campaign trail.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.600
You didn't dislike people who didn't agree with you.

5
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.820
You didn't dislike people who insulted you,

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.330
you didn't dislike the people you were running against. You spoke, um,

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.910
fondly and with a lot of empathy, um, of, towards people on the other side,

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:27.180
the way you framed your, your, your policies had that dimension.

9
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:30.180
You're talking about the Bernie Sanders and imagining yourself to the left of

10
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:34.770
him. But one way people experienced politics is interesting ideological.

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:39.120
It's also on this axis of confrontational newness

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.520
and you a pretty, um, distinctive like left policy agenda,

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.490
but on the confrontational access, you were way down, right?

14
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:48.211
You would talk to people.

15
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:51.600
Democrats would rarely talk to go on programs that would rarely go on.

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.730
And even now on Twitter, I think you very,

17
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.420
self-consciously cultivate a very nice persona in a very nice space.

18
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.690
And I'd like to hear a bit about how you think about that,

19
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.910
because whether it was all authentic,

20
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:05.700
I think there's at least some recognition that it has power now.

21
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.340
And given that it's a pretty basic thing.

22
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.060
I think it probably had more power than you would have expected,

23
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.600
or certainly than I would've expected.

24
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.270
<v 1>Wow. I hadn't thought of it. And in those terms,</v>

25
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.530
but I mean, you've known me for a while. So you know that, um,

26
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.420
the nice thing is a complete facade

27
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.870
that I'm actually naturally very bitter. Um, now it's,

28
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.470
it's the case that I like most Americans.

29
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.640
And then I think that there've been massive problems that have been built up

30
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.320
over decades and decades.

31
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.620
And you wrote a book on polarization and why we're polarized.

32
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.540
And I feel like people have gotten driven into different corners and pitted

33
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.240
against each other in a way that's unproductive.

34
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.680
I naturally don't get angry at people that disagree with me.

35
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.720
I kind of expected degree of political, uh, asynchrony, because,

36
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.330
you know, it's like not like someone's going to believe everything you believe.

37
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.220
And one of the things that I did find running for president was that

38
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.610
the media would often try and go to me into conflicts.

39
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.360
It would be like, this person said this, what do you think about that? And,

40
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:20.300
and the dynamic was supposed to foment and expression of outrage.

41
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.350
And then I would say something that seemed to me to be like the natural

42
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:24.891
reaction,

43
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:29.510
but I just think that the outrage cycle is very,

44
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:32.900
very negative. Uh, and I think a lot of Americans,

45
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.740
including me are very tired of it, but I can genuinely say it.

46
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.250
Wasn't really a strategy on my part. And it's not a strategy now,

47
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.960
except in so far as when I'm putting out a message,

48
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.580
I just find it more productive for me to be positive

49
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.160
than for me to throw a rock at somebody.

50
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.140
<v 0>It struck me too, that it reflected in part the media you came up through.</v>

51
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:01.960
So I think when most run for president, they think about getting coverage on,

52
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.640
you know, MSNBC and in democratic or liberal aligned

53
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.380
publications, which have,

54
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.620
which tend to reward and more confrontational approach.

55
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.010
And that's true also for centrist publications, right? You, you,

56
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.270
you have a great story on your blog about being at an early Iowa event.

57
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.550
And like all the reporters are there to hear Michael Abinadi,

58
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.000
including like the centrist reporters who just want conflict, but you came up,

59
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.490
I mean, you're on my, on this podcast pretty early in your campaign,

60
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.670
but you did Joe Rogan's podcast, my friend, Sam Harris, um,

61
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.800
you were on like a lot of YouTube world things, and that's a, that's a,

62
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.280
it's a very political space. And sometimes it can be even an angry space,

63
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:41.710
but it's, it's like a more mixed space.

64
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:46.630
You have like a lot of fans on Reddit and four Chan. And that struck me as,

65
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.420
uh, like informing your approach way through that,

66
00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:55.030
that those are different worlds to talk to where people have different political

67
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.930
concerns.

68
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.520
And it always struck me that you ended up representing a slightly less polarized

69
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.410
media in what ended up working for you and what you then

70
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.010
were rewarded for saying, and, and representing and politics.

71
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.130
<v 1>Israel. I genuinely went where they would have me,</v>

72
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.200
I guess, where like the, the, uh,

73
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.030
MSNBC's and CNN's, um, uh, and, you know, central,

74
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.090
his publications were not very excited to have me on, frankly.

75
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.260
So if you were me and you were like, who wants to talk to me? Like, Hey,

76
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:32.094
do you want to talk to me?

77
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.690
That's one reason I'm grateful to you because you had me on when others were

78
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:40.290
not. And so I'm grateful to you, and I've always seen you as a very,

79
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:45.180
very smart fact-driven purveyor of what

80
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:48.000
you regard as truth, you know, and, and it's, you know,

81
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.090
it's one reason I appreciate you and this conversation so much,

82
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.250
and I did not get that vibe

83
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.520
from some other outlets and journalists. And so, you know,

84
00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:02.130
it really wasn't necessity being the mother of invention,

85
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.770
where I would talk to people that would have me on, um,

86
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.170
and a lot of those folks where you tubers and,

87
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.200
and podcasters and folks who didn't have a cable network behind them.

88
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.580
<v 0>Yeah. It's a, and it worked, I mean, I want to get to UBI,</v>

89
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.370
so we won't spend all, all the time looking retrospective of your campaign, but,

90
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.240
but it did just strike me as I thought,

91
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:23.250
you and Pete Buddha judge did the best job of this.

92
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:24.420
And you did somewhat differently. Right?

93
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:26.970
I don't think people would have judge would have gone on Ben Shapiro show and,

94
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.690
and, and debated circumcision like that wasn't his vibe, but there was, uh,

95
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.150
like Joe Biden for his virtues has a very old media view

96
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.340
of politics. And also doesn't do that much media.

97
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.180
And a lot of Democrats would come up through, through the ranks for a long time.

98
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.110
Like they saw media very much. I would call it the way it wasn't 2005,

99
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.400
and now there's this burbling fractured and it can be very polarized,

100
00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:54.780
but it also can be very mixed up in a way that can be useful world out there.

101
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.970
And that if you're a lot of it,

102
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.270
much more audience than people, um, I think in the mainstream media recognize,

103
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.571
you know,

104
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.840
what some of these folks on YouTube were able to command is in the millions. It,

105
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.240
um, it, it, it rivals the cable networks,

106
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:11.630
but it doesn't have like the mainstream establishment, uh,

107
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.710
respect that say a cable network does. And so it gets ignored,

108
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.620
but it's no worse a way to reach people.

109
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.290
And I think Reddit had that quality for you too. You're very big on routers,

110
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.990
just aren't ready yesterday. And you're involved, I guess,

111
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:28.610
in some California data privacy initiative and had 23,000 up votes,

112
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.610
just noting that you were part of it. So these are,

113
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:33.250
these are pretty different worlds. And, and,

114
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:37.640
and I wonder how much you think the democratic party or just traditional

115
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.240
politics,

116
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.220
politicians in general are missing them and leaving these worlds unspoken too.

117
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.860
<v 1>Well. This to me is, um, something we should talk about more as well,</v>

118
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.630
because I think the shifting media landscape is going to impact

119
00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:56.860
politics very dramatically. And some folks are going to be late to it.

120
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.460
Like you're on top of it, just from that line of questioning.

121
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.990
But if you look at the cable news audiences, um,

122
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.710
you're looking at the low millions and it tends to be like the same 2 million

123
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:13.060
people over and over again. And you're talking about a massive population of,

124
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.490
you know, tens of millions of voters.

125
00:07:15.491 --> 00:07:19.930
And so you hit it on the head where if you look at the audience of some of the

126
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:23.320
biggest podcasts, uh, it goes into the millions.

127
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:27.850
It is higher than the cable news casts.

128
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.860
And they cable newscasts drive this media narrative bubble that

129
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.150
then gets self-reinforcing. And then everyone looks out out and says like, Hey,

130
00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:40.750
aren't you concerned about whatever the heck we were concerned about yesterday.

131
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.000
And meanwhile, like, they're just listening to Joe Rogan or whomever, you know,

132
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.050
like that they, they're getting a very different perspective.

133
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.030
And they're hearing about issues that are more relevant to them than a

134
00:07:55.031 --> 00:07:56.950
lot of the DC oriented issues.

135
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.230
The biggest example of that on the trail was impeachment.

136
00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:02.140
I don't think I got a single question about impeachment, uh, the entire time.

137
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:04.810
And then, and this was when he was actually getting impeached.

138
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.070
So there are different conversations happening,

139
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.510
and it would be very beneficial for politicians generally,

140
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:16.570
but Democrats in particular to start trying to broaden their universe,

141
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.890
because what you don't want to do is just end up in a world where just talking

142
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:23.140
to each other and then wondering why no,

143
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:25.300
one's listening to you and that's the danger.

144
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.040
<v 0>And one of the things that I like about these different worlds as somebody who I</v>

145
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:34.810
try to spend a certain amount of my media diet in subcultures that are not my

146
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:35.860
main one, um,

147
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.880
because I think it's important to know how their argumentative universe is work

148
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:42.490
and what they consider important and unimportant.

149
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.640
And this to me was always the secret of your campaign that people didn't quite

150
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:48.760
realize, uh, that politics,

151
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.600
Washington politics has developed a set of things that it considers like the

152
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:55.950
questions of the day, the week, the month, a year. Um, so, you know,

153
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.350
at a certain point it's impeachment, which is very, very,

154
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:01.530
it was important that like I ran an impeachment podcast and I think it's

155
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.830
important what was happening there. Um, but taxes, healthcare, I mean,

156
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.850
these are, these are real things you might ask, like, how did this guy,

157
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:12.660
Andrew Yang get on Joe Rogan and some of these other shows because he doesn't

158
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:15.090
allow just anybody on, um, that's a big show.

159
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.410
He has a lot of options about who comes on and there's this whole world that is

160
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:24.210
very focused on AI risk and what that's going to do and how that's going to

161
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:24.931
change things.

162
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:29.700
And when you came up and wanted to move that up as an issue in politics increase

163
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.030
like as a political scientist would say, increase in salience and politics,

164
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:33.941
there was a,

165
00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:36.990
a world of people there for that because they were already having that

166
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:41.370
conversation. But nobody in politics was like politics reflected. The,

167
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.780
the set of issues at Washington thought was important and understood how to talk

168
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:48.660
about, but it's not the only set of issues people care about.

169
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:51.990
And so then there are these whole worlds that are really underserved in terms of

170
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:52.860
their concerns.

171
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.750
And like what always struck me as an interesting bypass you took into this

172
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:00.660
was like the value of your campaign to me, was it, it,

173
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.540
it elevated concerns that deserve more attention to politics,

174
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.380
and they typically get not just solutions, but concerns. And you know,

175
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:10.470
that I have a different view on a lot of the AI economic risks than you do,

176
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.360
or at least somewhat. But, um,

177
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.030
but there's no doubt that it should be talked about.

178
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.370
And so you went where people were talking about it.

179
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:21.120
And I think there was a lot of surprise that so many people were so, uh,

180
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.850
were so concerned and so engaged on this.

181
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:26.280
And so ready for a candidate to try to say, no,

182
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:28.260
this should be one of the 10 issues we talk about. Like,

183
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:29.610
let's move something else out of the frame.

184
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.830
<v 1>Yeah, that's right. As well. Where if you talk to techies,</v>

185
00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:37.130
they're much more concerned about AI. And as you know,

186
00:10:37.131 --> 00:10:41.660
the central argument of why campaign around automation than a lot of other

187
00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:42.494
Americans,

188
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.500
and they were happy to talk to a political figure who was talking about

189
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.410
something that they'd been thinking about for months or years.

190
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.900
And one of the funny byproducts of it all was that I ended up having

191
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.780
conversations with people that didn't feel terribly political.

192
00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:04.400
If you know what I mean, it was like, look like what's going on with AI? Like,

193
00:11:04.401 --> 00:11:06.340
what should we be concerned about? Like what,

194
00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:10.820
what does that competitive landscape with China look like over time? Uh,

195
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.770
and because of that,

196
00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:17.510
I ended up reaching audiences that genuinely did not consider themselves super

197
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:18.344
political.

198
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.670
And hopefully I did broaden the range of concerns that we should be looking at

199
00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:26.210
as a country. And it wasn't very deliberate on my part. I mean,

200
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:27.530
I just cared about what I cared about,

201
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.390
what the folks who also cared about it,

202
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.880
but it is a sign how both DC and the media have this

203
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.200
relationship where there's like a set of prescribed concerns that may or may not

204
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:46.760
line up with the concerns around the country. Thank you for listening in.
