1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.290
<v 0>I think your book is,</v>

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.000
it is so timely and you obviously were working on it before everything

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.320
that happened with George Floyd and nationwide, it's called five days.

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:15.090
And it's about, uh, the five days at the center of the, um,

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.860
Freddie gray protests. Obviously you're in Baltimore right now.

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.510
You're from Baltimore. Uh, and so the city is near and dear to your heart. Um,

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.890
how did you experience, um, those protests in real time? Um,

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.180
and then how did this book come about?

9
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.621
<v 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:35.510
I remember the whole thing kind of a gun began when I was sitting in,

11
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:38.990
in Freddie Gray's funeral. And, and for those who, who might not remember,

12
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:43.130
you know, Freddie gray was a, a 25 year old young man, uh,

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.510
in Baltimore who made eye contact with police and ran. Um,

14
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.460
the reason I say that is because that was his crime was if you are in

15
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.640
a high crime, oftentimes high poverty area,

16
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.740
making eye contact with police and running is enough to trigger probable cause

17
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.060
had he done that in a wealthy neighborhood, he'd been going for a jog,

18
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.560
but he makes eye contact with police and runs in Harlem park

19
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.950
Sandtown-Winchester, which were two areas of Baltimore, West Baltimore,

20
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.780
deep poverty. And, uh,

21
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.100
he's arrested an hour after he's arrested he's in a coma.

22
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.080
And when he, the,

23
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.390
when he's finally taken to the university of Maryland medical center,

24
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.220
it is deemed that, uh,

25
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.900
he has three broken vertebrae and a crushed voicebox and a crushed larynx.

26
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.130
And so there were protests that took place in Baltimore for two weeks after

27
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:37.250
domaining justice and accountability saying, you know, how was someone arrested?

28
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.900
And an hour later they're in a coma and no one has an answer for what happened.

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.750
And, uh, and the morning of his funeral,

30
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:47.540
I went to the funeral and Andrew was crazy because I remember sitting in the

31
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:52.490
back of the church and I didn't feel like I had earned the right to make that

32
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:54.170
walk up, to go view the body.

33
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.900
So I just sat in the back and I left the funeral and

34
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.800
I had to fly to Boston to give a talk on poverty.

35
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.130
And the irony of that hit me really hard that

36
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.350
the night of his funeral was the night that Baltimore started this

37
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:15.831
process.

38
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:19.700
And that's when you saw the unrest take place literally to the point that by six

39
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.690
o'clock that night, the governor had called in the national guard, uh, and,

40
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.920
and put Baltimore under a state of emergency in a curfew. And, um,

41
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.260
and I found myself in Boston talking about poverty,

42
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.610
both because of the work that I was doing.

43
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.670
Cause at that point I was running an organization, um, that I,

44
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:37.340
that I founded that focused on helping students jet first,

45
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.610
generally first-generation students make it and stay in college.

46
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.180
But I also knew that they were there to kind of talk about my past and my

47
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:46.430
background and, and put me up as an example.

48
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.790
And it was in that moment that I started realizing how dangerous

49
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:57.380
that was, how it made me complicit as well. Wow.

50
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.080
That, that we can sit there and say,

51
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.110
and look at the people who make it and say it's because of them.

52
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.760
And that's such a great story.

53
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.300
And then look at ones who don't and say it's because of them.

54
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:13.450
And it's because they didn't work hard without understanding the systems that we

55
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.710
still have in place.

56
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.060
<v 0>That's what your book, the other Wes Moore is all about is that it's exactly.</v>

57
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.310
<v 1>Right. It's about the same.</v>

58
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.970
<v 0>Neighborhood and one winds up here and then the other one's up, uh, you know,</v>

59
00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:24.804
in jail.

60
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.980
<v 1>That's right. And how,</v>

61
00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:30.870
and how we are so quick as a society to either congratulate or to castigate

62
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.240
without being willing to understand or indict systems that we have

63
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:39.000
in all of this. And I think about this in context, and, you know,

64
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.800
earlier on this week, uh, you know, we had, uh, the, the, the,

65
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.340
the current governor of Maryland, you know, he announced that he's petty,

66
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:50.910
he's putting, he's putting out a book, right. And in the book,

67
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.150
he starts talking a lot about, uh, this moment.

68
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:57.100
And he was the brand new governor. He think he was governor for, for, uh, for,

69
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.990
for three months at the time when everything jumped off with Freddie gray.

70
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.100
But during this book he's spends time. And, and,

71
00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:07.950
and the exact quote that he used when he was describing the,

72
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.600
when describing Freddie gray was he called him a Crips gang connected

73
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.500
street level drug dealer with a long criminal rap sheet.

74
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.830
I spent four years focusing on and understanding what happened around Freddie

75
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:25.820
gray and what happened in Baltimore around those times. And,

76
00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:27.240
and here's what I do know.

77
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.100
And I can say this definitively that the story of Freddie Gray's life is a story

78
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:33.150
of societal failure,

79
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.550
because this was a young man who was born underweight and premature.

80
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.290
He was also born addicted to heroin because his mother battled heroin addiction

81
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:47.100
for much of her life. She grew up in deep poverty, her entire life.

82
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.970
She gives birth to twins. Once the twins are old enough to,

83
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.760
they actually gain enough weight, that they're able to leave the hospital.

84
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.000
They move into a housing project on North Carrie street over in,

85
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.020
over in West Baltimore.

86
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.160
And that housing project in 2009,

87
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:07.080
along with 480 other homes were actually cited in a civil lawsuit

88
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.880
because of the endemic levels of lead inside of that house. You know, and, and,

89
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:14.400
you know, it's just like, you know, the CDC, right?

90
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.260
The center for disease control indicates that if a person has six milliliters of

91
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.560
lead in every deciliter of blood, but never deciliter of blood,

92
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.970
that person will have cognitive damages for the remainder of their life. Right.

93
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.500
We've known this as a neurotoxin for a century. If a person has six,

94
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.650
Freddie gray had 36.

95
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.510
So this was a young man who was born premature underweight,

96
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.900
addicted to heroin and lead poisoned.

97
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.950
And by that time in his life, he's too.

98
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.560
And so when we're making these judgments about people,

99
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.690
by the time he was in fifth grade,

100
00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:58.300
he was four grade levels behind in reading of the cognitive damage of,

101
00:05:58.301 --> 00:06:00.260
of the lead poisoning. You know,

102
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.400
he finished his last recorded day of school in the Baltimore city school system

103
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.970
was in 10th grade. And he was 19 years old.

104
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.730
He had been in special education classes,

105
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:15.090
his entire academic career because of the lead poisoning. And so when we're, um,

106
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.200
I'm hearing this, uh, where, where, you know,

107
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.880
hearing the current governor making points about how well, you know,

108
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:27.350
he was a, he was, no, he was no choir boy. He was no singer in the church choir.

109
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.210
I know he wasn't, but I also know this is that Freddie gray never had a shot.

110
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.120
Freddie gray never had a chance.

111
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.650
And that was the point of all of this is that we have to understand all of these

112
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:41.150
moments and all of these periods.

113
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.680
We have got to understand it with a sense of context, because the truth is,

114
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.170
is that every system that touched Freddie's life,

115
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.240
whether it was the health system or the housing system or the education system,

116
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.930
or our policing system, that it not only failed to help him,

117
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.930
but it did severe and lasting damage.

118
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.780
And now we see the product.

119
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.140
<v 0>Yeah. And he dies in police custody after an hour. I mean, like that,</v>

120
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:11.980
that's like the brutal end, you know, to,

121
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:15.880
to a story of institutional, uh, failure. Uh,

122
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.540
and the, the tough part of it is that, like,

123
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:23.710
if you have a set of systems or an economy,

124
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:25.900
that's grinding people up and then someone

125
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.360
dies as a result. Uh, it's almost like a reflex to say, well,

126
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:35.220
what was wrong with this person? Uh, you know, because that,

127
00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:39.880
that's actually a more comforting stance and narrative than to

128
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:43.060
say, like, wait a minute, like maybe we've had, uh,

129
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.110
problems up and down for years and decades and generations, uh,

130
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.090
or even the fact that in his case, I mean, you know,

131
00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:51.040
he's born to a mother who's addicted to heroin. I mean,

132
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:55.600
you could probably trace some, some, uh, um, problems even before he was born,

133
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.280
um, to, to various failures. And th this is something so that the book,

134
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:03.070
one of the things in the book that struck me was, um, there's a woman, uh,

135
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
I believe her name is Tawanda Jones and she's,

136
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.920
she's protesting like, um,

137
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.670
I believe it was a brother or like someone else who, uh,

138
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.480
who was a victim of police violence. And, uh,

139
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:21.280
so she's holding like weekly protests before Freddy, uh,

140
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.220
dies. And,

141
00:08:23.221 --> 00:08:26.950
and then the Freddie gray protest ended up getting built into like a

142
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.100
preexisting. And this struck me forcibly, cause you're like, wow,

143
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:34.510
this is like a constant sort of waterfall of impacted

144
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:39.100
families and protests that preexist any one person where everyone's looking

145
00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:43.450
around being like, who are you protesting? Because they had like,

146
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.990
like different family members who'd been, uh, victimized.

147
00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:48.910
So that was one thing where I was like, wow,

148
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.540
like if you're in that environment like that, that, that is, uh,

149
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.290
mind blowing for most, um, tele Andrew, one.

150
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.110
<v 1>Of the most fascinating things for me about the project of writing five days was</v>

151
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.550
first identifying who were the people that I wanted to follow over this five day

152
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:06.750
period. And that I wanted to,

153
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.650
I wanted the reader to be able to walk through this era,

154
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.970
walk through this chaos, through their eyes, through the eyes of these people.

155
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.910
And one of the first people I knew that I was like,

156
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.760
I got to make sure she's profiled is to want to Jones.

157
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.130
And because it's important to remember that even in the two years before

158
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:30.260
Freddie gray, right, right. There was Chris Brown,

159
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.370
there was Anthony Anderson and there was her brother,

160
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.260
Tyrone West, and every Wednesday still to this day, in fact,

161
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:43.910
she just had the 371st straight West Wednesday where

162
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:45.890
every Wednesday she protests.

163
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.320
Sometimes it's just her and maybe one other person.

164
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.830
And sometimes she's got hundreds of people with her, but rain, sleet,

165
00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:54.350
snow doesn't matter. She protests.

166
00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:59.270
And she protests the fact that even prior to all this where she was

167
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:02.390
in and she found herself and that's having these amazing conversations with her

168
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.130
where she would say, you know,

169
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.320
I was so proud to March with the gray family when they called me and asked me,

170
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.520
and I was so proud of the fact that the city was standing up and saying,

171
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.670
you know, yes, we want justice and yes, we have to address policing.

172
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.571
But she said,

173
00:10:17.571 --> 00:10:22.400
but I just also felt a certain type of way where I still thought to myself,

174
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.240
but where was this when my brother was killed, right. Where was this?

175
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:29.150
When my brother's body was literally left in the middle of the street with mace

176
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.530
all over him and boot prints all over his body, where was this?

177
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.480
And so she, every Wednesday,

178
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.590
she protests demanding justice and accountability for what happened to her

179
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:41.450
brother. And she was,

180
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.100
she was such a fascinating person to follow over that five day period,

181
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.310
especially when you look at it in context of who some of the other people were,

182
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:52.730
right. So you had to Wanda, but then I also, you know,

183
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.880
going to spend time following a major Marc party,

184
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.750
who was a Baltimore city police major who grew up in West Baltimore.

185
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.170
And I remember him specifically telling me before we, he said, listen, you know,

186
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.740
I know that none of my colleagues woke up that morning with homicide in their

187
00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:11.510
mind. But I also know that for kids in West Baltimore, I grew up,

188
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.950
I know why they don't believe me, right. Or,

189
00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:17.960
or following someone like Greg Butler, who's a basketball star,

190
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:20.900
turned protester, or following someone like John Angelos.

191
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.740
Who's the son of the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, literally, you know,

192
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.540
a billionaire who was also the head of baseball operations for the Orioles

193
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.610
and base. And,

194
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:35.480
and on the Wednesday after baseball played its first ever game with no fans.

195
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:38.420
Now we're doing all the time, but their first ever game with no fans,

196
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:40.130
when the Orioles play the Chicago white Sox.

197
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.970
And it was because John Angeles was one of the people in the room making the

198
00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:47.600
final decision of basically saying, no, we should play the game.

199
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.050
Even though the city is in a state of emergency because the world needs to see

200
00:11:51.051 --> 00:11:51.884
this.

201
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.320
And so watching various and different perspectives of people like that,

202
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:57.580
people like, and Nick Mosby,

203
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.600
who's a city Councilman at the time whose wife was the state's attorney in

204
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:06.010
Baltimore, but watching it through their eyes, I think, uh, you know,

205
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.540
hopefully provided a real kaleidoscope understanding of the complexity of the

206
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:15.310
moment. But also that if we thought that this was just about

207
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.580
policing or just about Freddy,

208
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.310
that we're missing a bigger point,

209
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.940
that society was trying to tell us something else that they were hoping that we

210
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:26.020
would actually pay attention to.

211
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.310
<v 0>Well, there, there was another fact in the, uh,</v>

212
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.620
Towanda Jones narrative that also hit me really hard, which was that, um,

213
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.520
and I'm not sure if it was for her brother or for another, uh, victim,

214
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.590
but that they essentially settled for a million dollars and gave

215
00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:47.880
it to the three survivors of the victim of police brutality.

216
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.450
Um, and that struck me because it was a situation where it's like, well,

217
00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:55.950
you clearly know that something went terribly wrong if you were settling with a

218
00:12:55.951 --> 00:12:58.590
family, but, but there's no, um,

219
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.250
like no arrests made no accountability. It's just like, there's a death.

220
00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:06.660
And then there's like some, uh, some money. And one of the things that, uh,

221
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:11.430
I found when I was researching the extent of the problem of police misconduct

222
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.910
was that that actually happens all over the country where they're,

223
00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:19.140
they're settling these civil judgments to the tune of over a billion dollars a

224
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:21.780
year in the aggregate. Um, and,

225
00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:24.960
and so that's their way of papering over this problem. Um,

226
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.610
and so if you think about like the,

227
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:31.590
the number of times that happens and no one gets a dime or the

228
00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:34.470
number of times it happens in someone sues and it's completely unsuccessful

229
00:13:34.471 --> 00:13:37.740
because the, can you imagine trying to Sue your local police department? I mean,

230
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.910
that, that sounds, uh, like very, very difficult to me, you know, like, uh,

231
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.130
like you, you feel like everything would be uphill.

232
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.550
So the fact that you're still getting a billion dollars under those conditions

233
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.180
struck me as a sign, that the problem is orders of magnitude bigger.

234
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.090
Like if you had to try and throw a measurement on it, you were like,

235
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.990
police are causing billions of dollars of, uh,

236
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.880
bodily harm to Americans every single year. Uh,

237
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.430
and the fact that that was happening in Baltimore where there's like,

238
00:14:05.431 --> 00:14:09.180
no real responsibility, but here's some but like blood money essentially.

239
00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:12.060
It's like, Hey, we killed your dad, but you know, here's a little bit of money.

240
00:14:12.061 --> 00:14:15.330
Like maybe that makes up for it. Like that also hit me really hard.

241
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.680
<v 1>It w and honestly,</v>

242
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.940
and I think Towanda story is such a powerful one around it because she didn't

243
00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:23.160
take any money. And it was for that reason,

244
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.090
because they also knew that with taking the payment meant, there was also a,

245
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.470
you know, there was also essential.

246
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.390
<v 0>Agreement to never talk about this.</v>

247
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.460
<v 1>And she's like, I'm not going to stop talking about it.</v>

248
00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:35.310
So she never took any money for, and, and I, and,

249
00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:39.840
and you bring up an incredibly important point because there is this narrative

250
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.010
about Baltimore when people say, so what, what brought the temperature down?

251
00:14:44.011 --> 00:14:47.640
What calmed everything down in Baltimore. And, and oftentimes the narrative is,

252
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:50.610
well, it was when the national guard were called in, right.

253
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.830
That's not true because, you know, first of all, I can,

254
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.390
I can tell you as a person who, you know, very proudly wore the uniform,

255
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.050
you know,

256
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.580
oftentimes when you introduce military personnel in the situations that doesn't

257
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.700
calm situations now, right. But the second thing,

258
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:10.520
and the most important thing to remember is those are some of the biggest

259
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:14.420
protests that were going to take place in Baltimore were actually set to take

260
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:18.560
place the Saturday after the unrest, what happened,

261
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:20.240
why those protests never happened?

262
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.740
It wasn't because the national guard was there.

263
00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:23.510
The national guard was already there when they were being planned.

264
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.510
What happened was, was when the state's attorney,

265
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:31.400
Marilyn Mosby announced she was pressing charges against the six officers.

266
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.250
Because up until that point, you're absolutely right.

267
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:38.480
Andrew it's like th th the thread was common, right? Something happened,

268
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.750
a payout ensued, and it went away.

269
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.810
That was a general trend, right?

270
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.070
But this was the first time in Baltimore history

271
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.400
where the state's attorney was actually saying, no,

272
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.540
I'm actually pressing charges against these officers for misconduct.

273
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.160
I remember being there.

274
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.360
And you're where there was almost this celebratory vibe throughout the streets

275
00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:05.780
of Baltimore. Cause people were shot. People are like, what, wait, what, wait.

276
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.130
She announced what?

277
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.570
That they're arresting the officers for that because we hadn't,

278
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.580
we had never seen before. And now granted fast forward, you know, we had,

279
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:19.940
two of the officers were found not guilty for the officers where their case that

280
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:24.230
their charges were were, were, were dismissed. Um, but that moment,

281
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.640
that was what actually what brought the temperature down because people thought

282
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:33.260
for the first time, we actually might see justice. And what's interesting. Now,

283
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.990
I think even when you look at what happened with what's happened with George

284
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.823
Floyd,

285
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.300
one of the big differences I think between then and now is the bar has been

286
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:46.250
risen where at that point, the charges were like,

287
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.010
Whoa, that's a big deal, calmed everything down. Now,

288
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.280
charges have been filed the bar isn't about charges anymore,

289
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.300
the bars convictions. And that's going to be the real test to see,

290
00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:00.320
can you actually get convictions for, you know, for, for these,

291
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:02.480
for these instances, in the case of torch Floyd,

292
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.460
when you were literally watching a grown man in handcuffs on the

293
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:12.260
ground with another man nonchalantly leaning his knee into his neck until he can

294
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:16.040
no longer breathe. I mean, the bar is not, can we get an arrest, the bar,

295
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.110
his conviction for that?

296
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.840
