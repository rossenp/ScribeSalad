1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.321
<v 0>Well, Friday night,</v>

2
00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:05.370
we all got hit by the terrible news that Ruth Bader Ginsburg has passed away at

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.730
the age of 87 or fifth bout of cancer.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.430
And I was talking to someone and they said,

5
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.870
I think at least what I felt it's like,

6
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:17.220
you kind of felt like she was going to hang on until, uh,

7
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.240
after this election.

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.290
And it was clear that she was fighting to hang on and she's a very strong

9
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:27.090
person, but, um, her strength ran out, uh, you know,

10
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:31.770
we're all human and she passed away Friday night.

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.450
Uh, and the question is, uh, what does this mean? I mean,

12
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:40.410
the first thing is you, you honor the passing of an icon,

13
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.510
someone who is a trailblazer, uh, uh,

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.240
for really, um, women certainly in the legal field,

15
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:52.380
but she, I think she was bigger than, than that, where she stood up for,

16
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.930
uh, an evolving sense of what human rights were, uh,

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.220
over her career, really transcended generations. Uh, you know what I mean,

18
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.730
what a full life, uh, I think someone said, it's like, you know,

19
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:10.350
you can't imagine living a more impactful, more important life, uh,

20
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.430
leading a more important career than she did. So on one hand,

21
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.920
you just look up and say, wow,

22
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.990
like so grateful that she was among us and did what she has

23
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:23.820
done. Um,

24
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.230
and that lasted unfortunately for apparently about, uh,

25
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.120
30 seconds before then people started turning towards what this means in terms

26
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.910
of the Supreme court, uh, this election,

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.550
whether Trump is going to nominate someone,

28
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:40.440
which I think he announced he is going to,

29
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.730
and then whether the Senate would move forward to confirm a new justice,

30
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:48.060
despite the fact that the election is at this point

31
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.690
44 days away. Uh,

32
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:56.220
and the average Supreme court confirmation process takes 2.2 months

33
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.300
and that's an, a normal circumstance. So, uh,

34
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.570
so to me, it's really

35
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.510
awful that after sandbagging Merrick, Garland, uh,

36
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.960
in 2016, where they say, Hey, look,

37
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:14.970
it's only a year until the election. Like,

38
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.960
let's not deal with this until after the election. Uh,

39
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.950
and then now when you're in the reverse situation, but instead of having a year,

40
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.840
you have six weeks and you're like, no, no, this time we're gonna,

41
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.960
we're just going to cram this through because it's a, you know,

42
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:34.050
a different situation. Um, like that strikes, I think,

43
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.090
any reasonable person as utterly ridiculous and awful and,

44
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.480
like, you know, it's, it's just a clear, uh,

45
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.090
double standard where you take one approach.

46
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:49.380
If it's a justice that represents a viewpoint, you don't like, and then, uh,

47
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:50.850
when the shoe's on the other foot, then,

48
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.110
then you take a totally different approach.

49
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.400
<v 1>So here's a couple of dots. Um, one like it's heartbreaking.</v>

50
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.890
Like she was a, um, even president Trump was asked, like if we got to,

51
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.290
they got a very real candid reaction of him.

52
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.120
Cause he found out the news Friday night from a reporter after his rally, um,

53
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.400
which quick comment his team should have told him between the walk from the

54
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:17.810
rally to his press. That's what we would do and be like, Hey, by the way,

55
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.820
if so-and-so died or this broke, that news, whatever it is, anyway, he did say,

56
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.640
wow, like I have nothing to say, except she's an amazing woman.

57
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.320
Like she lived an amazing life. Um, this is very sad, something like that. Um,

58
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.410
and then it is heartbreaking. The reality is though,

59
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.470
what you just said is that this is going to be extremely politicized and we're

60
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:37.660
not even gonna wait. It's just gonna, it's already started. Um,

61
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:38.620
so I thought it'd be,

62
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.600
we wanted to hop on the pod and break this down. Um,

63
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.380
because this is your September surprise.

64
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.120
This will be the focal point of election and Tim Alberta.

65
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.670
Who's one of our buddies from the campaign. Um,

66
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.470
just wrote a piece in Politico talking about what Trump and McConnell would or

67
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.990
could do, but one of the things that's fascinating, Andrew,

68
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:06.100
and this is why it matters is that the Supreme court

69
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.760
is, and I quote the most and quote,

70
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.560
the most important factor in voting for president or when they go to vote

71
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.630
for 21% of the electorate, 21% of all voters,

72
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.450
this is the Mo this is the thing they care about. Um,

73
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.280
so thoughts on how this affects Republicans affects Democrats,

74
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.920
like it's gonna effect, this is the most important thing for almost everybody,

75
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.540
um, when it comes to voting and you now have this hanging in the balance before,

76
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.960
one of the more important elections we've ever had.

77
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.181
<v 0>Well,</v>

78
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:40.920
one legitimate reason to be concerned about having an even number of justices

79
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:44.190
right now. And this is before, uh, you know,

80
00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:49.140
we get to what you just described is that back in 2000,

81
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:53.610
the Supreme court essentially helped decide the election between, uh,

82
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.470
Al Gore and, and, and George W. Bush, uh,

83
00:04:58.471 --> 00:04:59.670
you know, they decided five,

84
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.140
four along unfortunately party lines about what to do with the Florida recount.

85
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.480
Uh, and, and so you have a very real impact on potentially the resolution on the

86
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:13.830
election, uh, which to me is another reason why it's,

87
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.730
it's terrible for, uh, us to try and cram a new justice in,

88
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:21.150
and then have that just as literally, maybe turn around and decide an election,

89
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.380
uh, days later. I mean, like, I don't think that strikes anyone as a good idea.

90
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.690
Um, but to your point,

91
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.310
there are millions of Americans who have been focused on

92
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.270
the Supreme court and other courts around the country and Republicans have done

93
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:41.220
a superior job of motivating their base around, uh,

94
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.100
judicial appointments. Uh, they, they, they're very,

95
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:48.270
very consistent on that and they,

96
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:52.980
they care more about non Supreme court, judicial appointments,

97
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.290
I believe, uh, then the other side, uh,

98
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.180
and they're smart because those judges ended up deciding a

99
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:05.630
lot of things, uh, that never even get to the Supreme court. I mean,

100
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.280
it's not like the Supreme court hears everything, you know,

101
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.540
that you have to go through several levels, uh, to, to get there.

102
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.300
<v 1>How Trump won over the evangelical, right, is that, Hey,</v>

103
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.260
you don't have to love Trump,

104
00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:21.580
but he's going to stand for conservative values on, in, on our Supreme court,

105
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.960
here's a list of justices.

106
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:26.410
I'm going to nominate you drop that in may of 2016 before the election.

107
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.420
So that sorry to interrupt with that a big.

108
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.810
<v 0>No, not at all. You're right. They're very smart and deliberate about.</v>

109
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.880
<v 1>It. They knew it. They knew the numbers.</v>

110
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.930
<v 0>And evangelical voters listen, and they say, look,</v>

111
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:42.010
I can hold my nose and vote for this man, because he's going to stand up for,

112
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.560
uh, the things I care about instead, or whatever that, whatever they believe in.

113
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.410
Well, I mean, that's, that's,

114
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.950
I think the most common issue for folks who are focused on, uh,

115
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.780
these appointments is, uh,

116
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.860
is pro-life versus pro-choice the big one now.

117
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.920
So the question now,

118
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:07.810
if you look at the actual ins and outs of nominating and

119
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:10.840
confirming a Supreme court justice,

120
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.850
you need several Republican senators to say, look, I'm not going to do this. Uh,

121
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.790
given the timeline, given the circumstances, um,

122
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.600
you need approximately three to come out and say that that,

123
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:27.070
that they're not down for this hurry up confirmation process.

124
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:27.970
Uh,

125
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.960
and there there's a real possibility that those three Republican senators exist.

126
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.890
So if you, and I believe, uh,

127
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.830
at least a couple of them have already signaled that they are not going to go

128
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:41.350
along with a confirmation process.

129
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.910
And some of them are up for reelection right now in a really tough races. Uh,

130
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.510
Susan Collins in Maine, um, is one of them.

131
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.280
So hope is not lost in the sense that, uh,

132
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:59.200
there's a real chance that enough senators look up and say,

133
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:01.870
look, it's, it's really, really, uh,

134
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.300
not appropriate for us to cram a Supreme court justice,

135
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.310
uh, in this timeframe six weeks before an election, uh, you know,

136
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.490
after we essentially waited a year, uh,

137
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.860
in 2016 saying that the people should decide.

138
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.590
I think if we have a consistent message right now,

139
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:23.620
it should be let the people decide, but, you know,

140
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:27.430
and to your point about how this is going to affect the election,

141
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:31.480
it's going to energize voters on both sides. Uh,

142
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.700
there are many people who are going to look up and say, wow,

143
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:37.210
we need to get Trump reelected because he can appoint a replacement to Ruth

144
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:38.044
Bader Ginsburg.

145
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.880
And there are many voters around the country who say we really need to get Joe

146
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.450
and Commonwealth liked it because they're going to appoint a replacement to Ruth

147
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:50.770
Bader Ginsburg. And that to me is appropriate. Like that is a much,

148
00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:55.120
much better process for us to determine who replaces RBG

149
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.300
than doing this, uh, completely rushed and

150
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.370
inconsistent with past practice, uh, confirmation process that some people are,

151
00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:11.240
are looking to, um, to, to shepherd through in record time. I mean,

152
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.260
the whole thing just leave a terrible, terrible sense, uh, in many,

153
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:20.460
many American's minds as to what this process

154
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.193
became.

155
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.370
And especially if it turns out that this new justice ends up having an impact

156
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.160
on, uh, the outcome of the election,

157
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.250
because there is a real chance that there are legal challenges associated with

158
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:33.084
this election.

159
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.670
<v 1>I think this probably is a net positive for Republican turnout,</v>

160
00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:40.730
more than Democrat turnout in the sense that I feel like Democrats have a

161
00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:45.680
million reasons to want to vote against the Donald or fill their

162
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.580
principles violated in certain ways. But Republicans may have been on the fence,

163
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.130
but I don't love this Trump guy. And he's like,

164
00:09:51.131 --> 00:09:55.610
I'm just gonna stay home or now like, well, I now know I'm getting my vote.

165
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.750
If we win guarantees a conservative justice on the, on the court, um,

166
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:04.340
that is more powerful. Um, now let me ask you this. Um,

167
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.890
or could it be more powerful? Let me ask you this though. Um,

168
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.670
this is what's Tim Alberta's point. We're just fascinated. He's like, if,

169
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.740
so on one hand, Trump could say, Hey,

170
00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:16.700
I want to nominate a Supreme court justice before the election. Here it is.

171
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.670
I'm going to get done. Um, cause who knows,

172
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.710
or they could wait, they could say like, we're elected me and I will do this.

173
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.350
Um, and even if he loses,

174
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.670
they still might be able to pass this thing and approve it between the end of

175
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.580
November 3rd or whenever they actually, we count the votes.

176
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.320
And when Mike Pence swears in, uh, the next,

177
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.240
you know, the next Senate, right, the next Congress,

178
00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:44.270
I think that's the Vice-President's job. Do you? And that's his point?

179
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:48.110
He's like Mitch McConnell has options here and he might actually choose to wait,

180
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.730
um, cause he can still get what he wants,

181
00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:51.260
but it affects the election in a different way.

182
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:54.590
What are your thoughts on how to play that? Or if they,

183
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:57.320
which way they lean either? I don't know. It's interesting question.

184
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.430
<v 0>Well, the excitement for Republicans, um,</v>

185
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.200
could be elevated either way. Like if you don't,

186
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.360
if you don't get the justice, say, look,

187
00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:11.000
you gotta vote for Trump so we can get this justice. That's very,

188
00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:13.970
very powerful motivation. Um,

189
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.830
if they get the justice through, I would argue that,

190
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.340
you know, you would also motivate the same group of voters, um,

191
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.810
because they would see that that voting for Trump gets

192
00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:30.830
results in a particular way. Yeah. So, uh,

193
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.230
but I agree that there, there is a tactical issue. Uh, you know, it,

194
00:11:35.231 --> 00:11:39.530
it could be exciting to Republican voters who are motivated around this, uh,

195
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.270
to say, uh, you gotta get out there if you want this justice. Um,

196
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.050
I would also suggest though that, to me,

197
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.410
let's say Trump loses and that outcome is determined in November.

198
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.620
And then for the Senate then to turn around and say, Hey,

199
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:58.780
the American people chose Joe, but now we're,

200
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:01.810
we're still going to go ahead and cram in this appointment. Um,

201
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.570
I think that they would have a very,

202
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:08.260
very hard time convincing both the American people and uh,

203
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.720
even the Republican senators that,

204
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:13.480
that was appropriate in the least,

205
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.980
I think there would be a half a dozen Republican senators, uh,

206
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.900
who would stand up and say, look, uh, you know, we just lost an election. Uh,

207
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.920
you know, like we're literally in a lame duck session in the last month,

208
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:31.090
the waning days of, of this Senate,

209
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:34.690
like some of us are leaving, like, uh, like I don't think, um,

210
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.700
I don't think that process, uh, would, would, uh, stand up personally.

211
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.850
I mean, like I've been wrong before about cause you know, people,

212
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.790
people aren't very principled in some of these situations,

213
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:50.320
but I think that would be in some ways the most distasteful

214
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:51.154
approach.

215
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.150
<v 1>So here's what I say. I want to know if you agree with this,</v>

216
00:12:54.151 --> 00:12:58.200
like this is all we can kind of say right now because you never know how these

217
00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:01.220
things play out. Um, but here's what I'd say to look out for.

218
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.580
I don't want what your thoughts, why you think I'm right.

219
00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:05.280
I say one lookout for the Republicans to use this,

220
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.620
I will say extremely well to help Trump win in 2020. Um,

221
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.550
cause I think Mitch McConnell while he's a scumbag and the definition of a

222
00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:18.600
hypocrite, he's a genius. He is a political genius. If you will, like,

223
00:13:18.601 --> 00:13:21.570
he's a mastermind at winning elections, you should not win.

224
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.880
And getting these pastors should not be passed and doing things the American

225
00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:26.580
people do not like, or even, um,

226
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.640
have any sort of tendency to approve on a majority basis.

227
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.290
But I'd say political side from the Republicans is going to use well,

228
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.910
I think I'd be interested to see how this engages the, um,

229
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.600
the women's vote in 2020. That's the second piece of this. Um,

230
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.390
because I do think that's what RBG stood for and that,

231
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.010
that puts this issue front and center on the ballot to me. Um, and then third,

232
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:54.690
I'm really interested in how the Democrats can respond to this

233
00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:59.250
without, um, frankly you're looking kind of lame or soft where it's like, no,

234
00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:01.530
don't do it wait for us. Or I, you know,

235
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.830
like without looking reactive or passive in a certain way. Um,

236
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.410
but those are my three, I dunno, anything to watch out for what you think.

237
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.970
<v 0>Yeah. The, the the message should be let the people decide. Um,</v>

238
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.880
we have an election coming up in, in, in six weeks. Uh,

239
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.540
one reaction I did see, uh,

240
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.190
that people were taking right now is to donate to Mitch McConnell's opponent,

241
00:14:23.191 --> 00:14:25.130
Amy McGrath. Uh, and,

242
00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:28.830
and I would suggest that there are a couple of better things you could do than

243
00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:32.940
that though. That's a very natural, emotional reaction. Um, but, uh,

244
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.820
Amy McGrath not hurting for money. Um.

245
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.680
<v 1>Money is not helping when right now she's not going to lose enough money. Yes.</v>

246
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.870
<v 0>Extra dollars in Aquafina, make note nine.</v>

247
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.170
<v 1>Senate races open that are closer right now that could use the money. Sorry.</v>

248
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.780
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. That's exactly right. Like,</v>

249
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.820
like if you're thinking I'm going to donate, um, to Mitch McConnell's opponent,

250
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.920
pick one of the other races, uh, and donate to them instead, uh,

251
00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.360
like Lindsey Graham's opponent,

252
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:02.270
Jamie Harrison's actually neck and neck with him in South Carolina,

253
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.890
that's a political earthquake in the making. So you don't, you can donate that.

254
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.430
Like there are a bunch of other races that make more sense. Uh, and the,

255
00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:16.220
the second thing is to try and put pressure on

256
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.090
some of these moderate Republicans are going to be, uh,

257
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.540
trying to decide whether or not to go along with this, uh,

258
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.980
hurry up confirmation process. So Mitt Romney's one, uh,

259
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.070
Lisa Murkowski is another Susan Collins is another, uh,

260
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.270
and there are a couple of others, um, that I believe are sway a bowl.

261
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.190
Um, and that could be for political purposes, if they're up for reelection, um,

262
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.850
or it could be, uh, no, uh,

263
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.200
just an emotional appeal as like your, their constituents constituent.

264
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.400
Let's say you're their constituent and you voted for them and didn't vote for

265
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:57.050
them. Say, look, you know, you're like, you're my Senator, uh, that, like,

266
00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.540
I feel strongly that you should just let the people decide.

267
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.690
Let's let the election go. Like, uh, you know,

268
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.920
working on the winnable Senate races and then working on the moderate

269
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:10.340
Republicans who are going to decide this thing, um, or their opponents,

270
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:14.750
if that's the way you decide to go, you know, like, um, then, uh,

271
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:19.730
that to me would be like a couple of very concrete things that

272
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:22.420
you could do. Uh, another thing would, would be just to,

273
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.960
to do more of whatever you're doing now. So, uh, phone bank,

274
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.770
call people, text, bank volunteer, make sure and vote,

275
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.310
get your friends to register, to vote, particularly in swing States, um,

276
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.330
around the country. Um, so those are some of the things that,

277
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:42.980
that I think we should be doing. The Senate looks very, very, uh,

278
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.190
winnable for Dems this cycle,

279
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.640
where they could get a slight majority if they win some of these races.

280
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.600
<v 1>So the Senate races that are close and closer to</v>

281
00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.430
McGraths are in Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Arizona,

282
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.170
Michigan, Colorado, Texas, even Alaska. So those are the number of States. Um,

283
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.790
give me more info, yank speaks listeners. Um, so I agree. Um,

284
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.140
we learned this a lot when we were running,

285
00:17:11.141 --> 00:17:14.020
is that if you actually call your Congressman or Senator,

286
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.660
they don't get a lot of calls like this. So, um,

287
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.670
if you're in many States and got five friends to call,

288
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.730
that actually has a way bigger impact than you think. Um,

289
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.440
because people are like, Oh, you don't listen to people.

290
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.370
The people don't actually talk to them very often. Um, so that actually works.

291
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.410
Let me ask you this.

292
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.900
And I think it's a good way to close is this feels dark to me.

293
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.230
This is a sad day. This is a sad moment. Um,

294
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.190
I, I think ignoring your political ideology,

295
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.630
I think a balanced court is better than an overweight Republican one,

296
00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:45.560
particularly when I think that the,

297
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.970
like the popular vote voted for Clinton last time.

298
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.720
Like I think the majority of the country is leaning more left at least in terms

299
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:56.460
of sheer numbers. Um, so this feels dark and heavy.

300
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.870
Um, and I there's a lot of people out there. Um,

301
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.480
we're looking for a sign of hope. Um,

302
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.480
what to you, what's the positive spin on this?

303
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.640
What do you gives you hope as we come down the pipe, um, post RBGs legacy.

304
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:19.130
<v 0>First day, it really is reflecting on what a tremendous, uh,</v>

305
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.260
figure and leader.

306
00:18:21.261 --> 00:18:25.670
She was just feeling like a sense of history. I mean, uh,

307
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.660
Evelyn was incredibly sad to hear of her passing, just, uh,

308
00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:32.120
Americans around the country, uh, are,

309
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.520
are devastated and just reflecting on what she's she means to so

310
00:18:37.521 --> 00:18:42.350
many of us, I was actually thinking to myself, wow. Her passing. Um,

311
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.100
I was trying to think of other people that would have had a similar impact on,

312
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.090
on millions of people around the country. And it's a very, very short list.

313
00:18:50.091 --> 00:18:53.930
I mean, she she's really, uh, one of the, uh,

314
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.610
sort of the Mount Rushmore of, uh, of, uh, living American figures and, and,

315
00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:03.080
you know, until this week, um, uh, the,

316
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.741
and one of the,

317
00:19:03.741 --> 00:19:07.100
so I think there are a few reasons why we're sad right now there are,

318
00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:08.600
and they're all important.

319
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:13.330
Number one is a human being that we are all that we all admired and

320
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.590
treasured is, has gone. Uh,

321
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.730
number two is the tough truth that while Trump has

322
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.620
nominated and confirmed two Supreme court justices,

323
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.640
they were replacing conservative justices. Uh, so we, we still,

324
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:31.940
as you were saying, Zach have like a moderately balanced court. I mean,

325
00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:36.140
unfortunately a lot of rulings are going five, four along party lines, um,

326
00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:39.950
with Roberts as sort of the swing, but you still have this sense of balance.

327
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.660
RBG is a very progressive vote.

328
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:47.630
And if you replaced the progressive vote with a very, uh,

329
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.920
conservative justice and some of the folks that they have on the short list, uh,

330
00:19:51.921 --> 00:19:56.480
to be the next Supreme court justice are very conservative.

331
00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.480
Uh, then that's, uh, a major,

332
00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:04.400
major shift for the court where you have then six, three or five,

333
00:20:04.401 --> 00:20:08.090
four conservative majority is consistently down the board, um,

334
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.140
which is why we're all hurting, uh, on the side.

335
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:17.510
And then the third thing is this for bidding sense that, uh,

336
00:20:17.511 --> 00:20:21.350
the Senate may abandoned principle. And, uh, and,

337
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.480
and because of the abandonment of principle,

338
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.490
there's a sense that our institutions are, uh, eroding even further.

339
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:29.070
Uh,

340
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.900
and in many ways I feel like this election is about the integrity of American

341
00:20:32.901 --> 00:20:34.790
institutions and our trust in them.

342
00:20:34.791 --> 00:20:38.090
And that that trust has been slipping for years and decades for a variety of

343
00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:41.360
reasons. Uh, and now the Supreme court,

344
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.030
which many of us have already questioned, um,

345
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.680
whether it's truly an apolitical entity over the last number of months and

346
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:52.450
years, but like now is in danger of becoming, uh, you know,

347
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.730
even more, um,

348
00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.400
of a political football. It feels like, you know what I mean? Like, and,

349
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.830
and so like, I mean,

350
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:05.950
heck I remember reading Supreme court rulings and like spending hours,

351
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.960
like pouring over the reasoning and, and whatnot.

352
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:12.640
And then now it seems like that stuff's not actually how these things go down.

353
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:16.030
It's just like, well, you know, like we were there, we pointed this person.

354
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.140
<v 1>Like, I felt like, I felt like people were like, they had their party line,</v>

355
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:19.921
you know, they were going,

356
00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:23.190
and then someone wrote some sort of dissertation or response wherever it's

357
00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:24.600
called to explain it to them.

358
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.000
<v 0>Yeah. Like backing into it. Uh, you know,</v>

359
00:21:27.001 --> 00:21:31.620
and each Supreme court justice has four brilliant clerks,

360
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.310
uh, who are like some of the best law school grads in the country. That frankly,

361
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.040
you, you could get like a pretty good explanation for it.

362
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.690
<v 1>I get it right. Bait. You debated, you know, you take the other side. Yeah,</v>

363
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.950
for sure. And there are logical reasons for a whole bunch. I mean,

364
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.870
like whether you agree with them or not,

365
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.520
you can find facts to support your opinion all the time. Um, sorry, keep going.

366
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.760
<v 0>I mean, I mean, it's like a sinking feeling, the sinking feeling you have,</v>

367
00:21:56.761 --> 00:22:00.570
because, you know, like you'd like to believe that legal reasoning transcends,

368
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.490
uh, like political beliefs. Um, so,

369
00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:08.160
so these are the reasons why we're all sad Zack and like they're all very

370
00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:11.850
legitimate, important reasons. Uh, like the, the,

371
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.680
the thing I would say that, um, you can take away from this, um,

372
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.840
that you could frame as a positive is that this will make it

373
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.240
indisputably,

374
00:22:24.241 --> 00:22:28.500
crystal clear to everyone on both sides on any side,

375
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.610
how important this election is. Like all of a sudden, you know,

376
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.250
you look up and say, wait a minute, uh,

377
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.550
there are a lot of fundamental, uh,

378
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.150
legal rights that you may take for granted.

379
00:22:42.151 --> 00:22:45.960
Now that may actually be changed or called into question, uh,

380
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.920
in the days to come. Uh, and so if,

381
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.200
uh, if there were folks who were,

382
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:56.070
who were on the fence about getting out there and voting, um,

383
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.040
on either side and there is this instinct that you,

384
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.070
you suggested before that Tim suggests that it's like that this is going to

385
00:23:02.071 --> 00:23:06.030
energize one side more than the other. Um, but T to me,

386
00:23:06.031 --> 00:23:09.540
the positive from this is to just show how important this election is going to

387
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:13.740
be, and that we all need to do everything we can, uh,

388
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.200
to get people out, to vote, to, uh,

389
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.550
to fight for the candidates that we believe in. Um,

390
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.830
because there's a lot at stake,

391
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.810
like a lot of things that we have grown to just believe

392
00:23:27.811 --> 00:23:30.720
as true about American life, um,

393
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.160
may be called into question. Uh,

394
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.230
if this election goes in particular direction.

395
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.580
<v 1>I think what gives me hope is, um, this, yes,</v>

396
00:23:41.581 --> 00:23:45.000
it puts importance on the election and your best case scenario right now to me

397
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.853
is we,

398
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:50.360
we turn out as a country cooler heads prevail in November,

399
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:52.640
and it's such a stomping that

400
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.310
your congressmen, your senators are on the way out.

401
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.960
There's the be ideally embarrassed from a clean sweep and that there's no way in

402
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:05.510
their right mind without massive revolt, um,

403
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.440
that they would try to push us across the finish line after the American people

404
00:24:09.441 --> 00:24:13.460
speak on November 3rd. That to me is, is a realistic outcome in our best case,

405
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.323
I think.

406
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.190
<v 0>No, I think there's a chance you see record turnout, um, in part,</v>

407
00:24:18.191 --> 00:24:21.250
because I think there are some folks who are going to be voting at higher levels

408
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:23.740
because of mail-in voting actually.

409
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.580
<v 1>And people are, you know, they're getting, I mean, I love like people to me,</v>

410
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:32.050
the NBA, every single NBA player right now is wearing like vote and running ads.

411
00:24:32.051 --> 00:24:35.320
Like to me, that's that that's never happened for my lifetime.

412
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:40.270
I don't think it has a zero impact. Um, and if it gets 5,000, 10,000, 50,000,

413
00:24:40.271 --> 00:24:43.930
a hundred thousand people in some of these States to vote and get a whole new

414
00:24:43.931 --> 00:24:45.160
election, and I will say,

415
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.540
FYI people falling in the democratic primary this year,

416
00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:54.280
2020 record turnout record turnouts for Biden,

417
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.670
for Biden, um, the same primaries we were in, you know,

418
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.320
Iowa New Hampshire record turnout. So that gives me hope, you know,

419
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.023
um.

420
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.730
<v 0>Let's, let's, yeah, let's get out there and fight for it and vote. I mean,</v>

421
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.880
that's really the big message you can take from this, uh, and,

422
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:14.050
and continue to be inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

423
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.860
because you can imagine the arc of her life and her career and the impact she's

424
00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:22.270
had been, you know, uh, if any of us can accomplish anything,

425
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.590
even like, you know, five, 10% of that. I mean, like, you know,

426
00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:29.020
we we'd consider ourselves very, very, very fortunate.

427
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.693
<v 1>Successful. Yeah.</v>

428
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.270
So thank you guys for tuning in this is our first kind of rapid response,

429
00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:37.690
but this is the fitting one, right? No better reason than,

430
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.020
than the passing of a, of a goat, the goat. Um.

431
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:46.810
<v 0>Yeah. It's passing out in historic figure. Uh, let's make her proud. You know,</v>

432
00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:49.480
the thing I'd say is like, for people who are sad right now,

433
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.640
just take that sadness and translate it into action,

434
00:25:51.641 --> 00:25:54.310
because that's what she would want for us.
