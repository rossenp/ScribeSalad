00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>The, the thing that has hit me, Joel,</v>

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:05.490
is that I used to think that if you had enough people on board with something,

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:07.170
then that would get the job done.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.270
But now I'm realizing that our government is increasingly detached from what it

5
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:14.520
is that we all want. Uh,

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.150
and I I've been digging into some of the structural reasons why that is.

7
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.960
So part of it is this 21%, um, satisfaction rate,

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.530
94% reelection rate. And you're like, well, that's a pretty big divide. Like if,

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.100
if I was, uh, let's say running a company, I'd be like, well,

10
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:33.570
this might not be introducing the feedback that I'm looking for.

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.350
Uh, uh, but because our government, like you said,

12
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.460
people just have just thought, okay, this is the way it is.

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.500
So it shall, so it was so whatever shall be. Uh, and so now, now for me,

14
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.920
it really is about the systems. It's like, okay, how do I like,

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.680
did representatives get elected? How do they keep getting reelected?

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.280
What are their incentives? How does the leadership work?

17
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.880
<v 1>This is a gridlock that's happened over and over on a thousand different things.</v>

18
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.800
Uh, and I mean,

19
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.910
obviously going back a few administrations and where they just were like,

20
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.090
born us, not going to do any, we're just not going to help you at all.

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.380
How what's the salute? How would you change that system?

22
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.700
So that would stop.

23
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.540
<v 0>All right, here are a few big things that we need to do.</v>

24
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.670
Number one is public campaign financing so that if you run and you get a certain

25
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:29.660
number of signatures, you get some public money, enough to be competitive. Uh,

26
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.200
by proposal during the campaign was a hundred democracy dollars for every voter

27
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:34.640
you can give to any candidate and you want,

28
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:36.830
and so then if I got 10,000 people behind me,

29
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:39.740
I get a million bucks and that's enough for me to, to compete and run,

30
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.990
wash out some of the corporate money. Uh,

31
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.490
because right now just the companies are bombing hundreds of millions of dollars

32
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.880
into various campaign. So that's, that's big domino. Number one,

33
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.570
number two is, uh,

34
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.820
open primaries in place of these party primaries and trying to make

35
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:00.830
the districts more competitive.

36
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.840
So right now over 80% of the congressional districts are either clean

37
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:08.780
Republican or clean Democrat. And in other words, there's no,

38
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.740
there's no uncertainty as to who's going to win the general election.

39
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.570
And so if you're a member of Congress in one of these safe seats,

40
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.050
then you don't care about compromising with the other side,

41
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:24.470
you just care about not getting primaried by someone in your own party,

42
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.390
typically someone much more extreme.

43
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.620
And so that ends up distorting your legislative incentives because it's like,

44
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:35.090
well, I'd rather just seem like I'm like very, very strong on this side.

45
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.030
And if nothing is done, like I'm safe.

46
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.900
But if I were to reach across the aisle and compromise and do something that

47
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:43.130
some people are unhappy with,

48
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.670
that's actually very bad for me in terms of my reelection prospects.

49
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.580
That's the current set of incentives that they have. Um,

50
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.940
so if you had open primaries instead of the closed primary system,

51
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.870
then you'd have to reach out to more people in your district and not just

52
00:02:56.871 --> 00:02:59.620
satisfy, um, the, the folks, your party,

53
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.750
the big change in this direction, that would be huge is ranked choice voting.

54
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.990
Because then if you have a number of

55
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.320
people in the district and it's open and ranked

56
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.750
choice voting, then it makes it so that no,

57
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.970
one's worried about wasting their vote for number one,

58
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.520
because right now it's like, Oh, you can't vote for that person.

59
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.870
You're going to end up costing us this election. If you're ranked choice voting,

60
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.480
you can vote for whoever the heck you want, and then trust that, uh, your,

61
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.220
your votes going to end up, um, counted in the best way possible.

62
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.710
Uh, and it also diminishes the incentives to campaign negatively because

63
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.000
if you were,

64
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.430
if let's say there are five of you in the field and I trash candidate,

65
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.460
number two, then that person looks bad. I look bad.

66
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.380
And then candidate number three is going to come up and peat us.

67
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.650
But so by choice voting elections,

68
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.320
everyone plays it more above board. Uh,

69
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.080
because when you start throwing rocks at people like, you know,

70
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.860
you look bad in the person you're throwing rocks at, it looks bad. So,

71
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:03.570
so these would be the, the biggest changes you could make. But the,

72
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:06.490
the change that I think has been rattling around for a long time,

73
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.040
that I am totally for, that would change this. Um,

74
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.690
maybe the most dramatically is just term limits for members of Congress, uh,

75
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:17.620
where if you have a term it's a little bit like term, uh,

76
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.140
18 year terms for Supreme court justices. Um,

77
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.380
but we're making almost the equivalent of lifetime appointments in Congress

78
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:23.860
right now,

79
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.160
where you have dozens of members of Congress who've been there for 30 or 40

80
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.420
years, uh, you know, like, and,

81
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:34.240
and you can see it too in the age of our leadership where not to knock,

82
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.630
you know, cause there, there are a lot of like awesome, um,

83
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.260
people of any generation, any stage. Um,

84
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.650
but we have the equivalent of a gerontocracy right now,

85
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.320
which is one reason why things feel the way that they do.

86
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.380
And then the average age of a us Senator, I believe is 62.

87
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.130
If you look at leadership, uh, Nancy Pelosi is standing Hoyer,

88
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.060
Mitch McConnell are all in their seventies or even eighties,

89
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.650
I believe in one case. Uh, so you, we,

90
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:06.190
we have a system that is rewarding seniority to the nth degree in

91
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:09.220
Congress and nothing ever changes. Um,

92
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:13.510
so I would have term limits for members of Congress at the end. What's wild.

93
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:14.680
Joel is when I looked into this,

94
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.230
it turns out the vast majority of Americans intuitively agree with,

95
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.610
with term limits. Uh, like it has something like a 78 or 80% approval rating.

96
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.550
So think about that for a second. Like what can you get?

97
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.010
80% of Americans do agree on like, not a whole lot,

98
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.360
but you can get them to agree on the fact that.

99
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.750
<v 1>Yeah, good. That's something they would all agree on.</v>

100
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:33.600
I liked chocolate and then yeah, that would be about 80%. Yeah.

101
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.440
<v 0>Yeah. It's like, I like chocolate and if I send someone to DC,</v>

102
00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:41.220
they should eventually come back about the only two things I could.

103
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.060
<v 1>I agree on. How do you get them to vote on something that would limit them?</v>

104
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.180
That's literally so counterintuitive.

105
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.700
<v 0>Well, my, my big, uh,</v>

106
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.050
proposal Joel is term limits for members of Congress,

107
00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:59.240
but current, uh, current members exempt or grandfathered in.

108
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.250
So if you're a current legislator,

109
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:03.510
you might get on board with this because you're like, well,

110
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.760
it doesn't affect me.

111
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.840
<v 1>And then it turns out strong Thurman was actually still alive. And he was like,</v>

112
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:15.700
it's fine with me. I'm 125 now. And yeah. How long did he laugh?

113
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.550
He was like when he was 94, something like that.

114
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.920
<v 0>Yeah, he, he got up there. Uh, so those are some of the big structural fixes.</v>

115
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.230
Uh, if there's something that I'm excited about right now,

116
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:28.540
that's sweeping the nation. It is, um,

117
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.900
running towards voting because some States are voting on it right now. Um,

118
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.770
I think Massachusetts is going to pass it Maine already has it. Um,

119
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.300
I think Seattle and New York city have it too, not statewide, but, um,

120
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.370
but in the cities. So when voters find out about ranked choice voting, they,

121
00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:44.920
they love it.

122
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.300
They get excited because everyone realizes it's just a better expression of

123
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.030
preference and it's a better democracy.

124
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.240
It's just a higher functioning democracy. If you can just say, look,

125
00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:58.450
I like this person first, this person's second, this person third.

126
00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.081
And then after that,

127
00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:01.540
I refuse to even express a preference because I hate everyone else.

128
00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:05.050
Like that's fine. You know, like that, that would, that would work.

129
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.510
That would have worked wonders, um,

130
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.650
over the last number of presidential cycles too, to be honest with you,

131
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:16.240
because if you look at what was going on in the Republican primary in 2016, uh,

132
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.990
Trump was, Trump won those primaries,

133
00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:23.140
but he wasn't getting 50% in a lot of the places, you know,

134
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.340
that there were a lot of places early on, whereas like Trump with his crowd,

135
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.190
but then there were, you know, whatever,

136
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.650
six or seven other candidates and they were splitting up the rest of you had

137
00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:36.100
ranked choice voting. It might be that someone else would have emerged on top.

138
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.510
<v 1>Yeah, no, I, I, and it's one of those things when you say it, you're like,</v>

139
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.550
why isn't it? It seems, it's such a, seems a logical as in like,

140
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.990
yeah, well, that's, that seems like such a, well, that's what you do. If you,

141
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.950
if you're in a boat you need an or because that makes you move.

142
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.930
Like that seems perfectly reasonable and it doesn't seem that complicated

143
00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.793
at all.

144
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.020
<v 0>Well, yeah, it's not. When people find out about ranked choice voting, um,</v>

145
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.870
it ends up winning everything because everyone looks at him and he's like, well,

146
00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:11.500
that just seems better. That's more logical. Like we should just do that. Uh,

147
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.390
and right now the only resistance is from frankly,

148
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.620
uh, folks who are currently in power who liked the 94% reelection rate who were

149
00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:22.960
like, Oh no, like this is going to complicate my life.

150
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.220
Like I've got my million dollar moat all set up. I could just like,

151
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.260
I could just crouch here forever, the current system. Um, so, uh,

152
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.180
but the average voter loves it.

153
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.130
And if we can get that done for anyone who wants a more vibrant democracy or

154
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.880
is thinking that there's a need for a third party in the United States of

155
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.110
America or other major parties,

156
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:48.970
because the current two party system might not be, uh, humming,

157
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.390
uh, then you should just get behind ranked choice voting because the great thing

158
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:54.850
about it is it's, non-partisan bipartisan. It's like, look, it's just better,

159
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.153
better democracy,

160
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.290
but it ends up enabling a more dynamic,

161
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.390
uh, third-party candidates as well,

162
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:06.960
because then the third party candidate can show up and be like, don't worry.

163
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.660
You're not going to help that person. You hate get elected or like,

164
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:12.120
you're not going to be wasting your vote and you can still vote for me.

165
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.320
And like people cause right now that that argument actually is very,

166
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:20.010
very powerful on people. It's like, no one wants to help. Um, you know,

167
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.110
the person, they like the least get elected.

168
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.040
<v 1>Massachusetts, Seattle, New York habit.</v>

169
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.310
<v 0>Uh, Massachusetts voting on it right now. Um, Maine has it, uh,</v>

170
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.870
and then New York and Seattle, I believe just recently adopted it or.

171
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.310
<v 1>Right. Yeah. And they gotta get rid of, you know, the, the college, you know,</v>

172
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.710
the, what do you call it? The electoral college that is, I, I,

173
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.033
I,

174
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.970
this is why I feel right about this is because even when I was six years old and

175
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:52.490
they were explaining governance to me and I was just like, what?

176
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.350
I'm so confused, why is it called a college, a we,

177
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.060
uh, w what is the point of it? And I couldn't, I still to this day are like,

178
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.380
so we, and, and doesn't make any sense at all.

179
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:09.290
And I get that it has benefited both parties.

180
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.310
It has benefited the Republican party most recently, uh,

181
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.460
with like Bush Gore and obviously Trump, uh, Clinton,

182
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.600
but it's benefited the Democrats at some point, but I still, to this day,

183
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:25.490
it's just like the popular vote seems as simple Ockham's razor.

184
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.380
That is the straightest thing line to electing the most popular

185
00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:31.214
person.

186
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.840
<v 0>So here's my proposal for the electoral college reform that I think would make</v>

187
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:36.680
everyone happy.

188
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.580
So the one problem with trying to abolish it is that you need a constitutional

189
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.890
amendment, super majority to do it. And you'd have a dozen States that are like,

190
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:50.150
wait a minute. I'm less influential under, you know, the popular vote system,

191
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:52.520
because I'm Nebraska Montana. Like, you know,

192
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.270
like the electoral college helps me. So, so then you, so you run into a very,

193
00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:57.710
very practical problem where it's like,

194
00:10:57.711 --> 00:11:00.020
I'll never get this change because there are a lot of people that would be

195
00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:02.420
shooting themselves in the foot. Um, there there's a,

196
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.070
there's a legitimate reason to it,

197
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.300
which is that let's say we had popular vote and I was running for president,

198
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:11.960
which I did. Thank you, everyone who supported me really appreciate it. Uh,

199
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.850
then I, I would never leave a major media market.

200
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.640
I would always be in a major media market because I just get more votes.

201
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.610
And then if I went, if I went to some less populated area,

202
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.490
just be a waste of time. Um, now right now,

203
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.180
like the balance might be excessive in a particular direction, but, you know,

204
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.570
I don't, I'm not sure it'd be optimal for us just to be, uh,

205
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.610
campaigning on the coast or in the big cities.

206
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.380
So that the change that would that's practical and doable that most everyone

207
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:41.540
should get behind that would also help ease.

208
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:46.130
This problem is you make it so that the electoral college awards,

209
00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:50.270
its votes, not winner take all by state, but proportionally by state.

210
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.850
So in other words, uh, if you know, California has 40, uh,

211
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.200
electoral votes or more than they get awarded proportional to how many,

212
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.580
how much I won that state by.

213
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:05.320
So it's that getting all of them I'd get 60% of them or something along those

214
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:06.880
lines. And if you did that,

215
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:11.140
then all of a sudden the incentives for national candidates would be to campaign

216
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:12.610
anywhere. They can actually move the money.

217
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.190
