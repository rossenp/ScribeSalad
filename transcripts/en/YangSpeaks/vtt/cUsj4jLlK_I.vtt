WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>So the monies are not going to flow to local journalism. Um,</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.500
but the local journalism,

3
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:09.390
sustainability act had so many smart things in it. Uh,

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.150
and you have to ask yourself if you're a member of Congress,

5
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:15.930
how can you be against trying to make local journalism function in your

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:17.100
community? Uh,

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.330
because theoretically they'd be helping cover you

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.640
like cover it, cover the issues you're working on that you care about. Um,

9
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:27.750
so for the life of me,

10
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.960
I don't understand why you only have 50 or 60 members of Congress.

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.890
It's bipartisan too. Cause a lot of the places that have lost their papers,

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.110
the fastest are more rural red States. Uh, you know, like,

13
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:43.980
like they, they see this problem just as clearly. Um,

14
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.900
so I'd love to, yeah, so this should be universal.

15
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.480
And one of the reasons we're going to have this conversation with you is trying

16
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.140
to push this because I want people to pass a local journalism sustainability

17
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.810
act. So, so for the folks that are,

18
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.130
are wondering how the heck can you reverse this tide?

19
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:06.780
Like what is in the local journalism sustainability act that would help fill

20
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:08.250
this one to $3 billion gap?

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.170
<v 1>Um, so, uh, I, Steve is really clever.</v>

22
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.970
He was, uh, worked at the,

23
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.650
the FCC and he did this like important report

24
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.360
documenting what was coming,

25
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:27.170
everything that was coming actually he's the one who really helps us get to the

26
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:31.730
one to $3 billion number because he's identified the critical information areas,

27
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:35.480
cost it out a way to a model of thinking about what are the key things that are

28
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:39.800
missing. And he's also identified a lot of safe ways. Um,

29
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.120
this is more recently now safe ways to direct money, to,

30
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.003
to news,

31
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.430
without fear that the government is going to control the

32
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:50.264
coverage.

33
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.430
<v 0>Yeah. W w I have to say that concern is so overblown because we all watch</v>

34
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:57.470
NPR, uh, you know, it's like,

35
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.440
do you really think that there's some government bureaucrat being like,

36
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:04.250
you know, like stop this Andrew Yang guy in his tracks,

37
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.840
like, um, you know, it's like,

38
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.740
like the fact that people are so concerned that if government touches it,

39
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:16.010
then all of a sudden we'll wind up in big brothers zone. Um,

40
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.900
but it just strikes me as, um, paranoid, frankly. It's like,

41
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.360
like you, you have models in other countries.

42
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.330
You're the BBC that's freaking publicly funded. Uh, you know,

43
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:29.780
it's been going on for decades and they managed to irritate politicians of every

44
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.720
Stripe. Uh, so there, there's no reason to think that,

45
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:33.860
especially if we're remote,

46
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.370
like if the federal government sends money to Tucson,

47
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.210
you're telling me that some bureaucrats going to be like, Hey folks in Tucson.

48
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.800
But like, we've got a school board candidate. We have our eye on like that,

49
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.380
you know, like that, that that's not, um, it's not anyway.

50
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.670
<v 1>I think that the reason people are paranoid is that there is like,</v>

51
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.230
there are propaganda efforts afloat that are working that are

52
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:02.110
privately initiated and we have, um, you know, a president.

53
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.550
<v 0>That's why we need to do this because you're seeing private propaganda fill the</v>

54
00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:10.080
gap, you know? So, so having a nonprofit or public funding model, um,

55
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.980
to me makes sense. And a lot of this stuff in, um, in,

56
00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:17.010
so I'm looking over here for some references because I want to get some of the

57
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:20.310
facts, right. Um, so the local journalism,

58
00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:24.060
sustainability act has so many fun measures in it, um,

59
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.020
that I thought were genius. Like you said, very, very clever. So number one,

60
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.820
everyone gets a $250 refundable tax credit to pay for a subscription to a local

61
00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:36.240
news source. So essentially you, you sign up for local news, it's free for you.

62
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.950
Uh, number two,

63
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.780
any small business gets a $5,000 credit to buy local advertising.

64
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:43.770
How fun is that?

65
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.970
<v 1>That's one of Steve's most genius ideas too,</v>

66
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:52.350
is that there's already a lot of government money that supports

67
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:54.540
advertising. And so we can take,

68
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.430
we can actually assemble a lot of money just by directing like public health

69
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:03.810
messaging to the places that actually by the way happen to be the most trusted

70
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.790
sources, local news.

71
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.450
Cause that's another thing like we trust the media except their local media.

72
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.440
<v 0>Except local media. We all instinctively trust local media more. Um,</v>

73
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.810
so to your point, It is more trustworthy.

74
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.370
It tends to be more objective and unifying. And that's why it's, uh,

75
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.710
it's depolarizing number three,

76
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:26.400
federal advertising budgets spent on local media organizations, uh,

77
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.630
and tax credits to maintain journalists and staffers number four,

78
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:34.980
three to one, a matching donation for any journalism, nonprofit.

79
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:38.670
So if you gave to your local nonprofit paper or whatnot,

80
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.210
you'd get matching funds. Number five,

81
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.640
define public service journalism as a tax deductible activity.

82
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.020
The one I loved the most,

83
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.940
number six was an opportunity to recede papers from private equity

84
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:55.380
funds, um,

85
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.590
that have gotten gobbled up or you could try and replant it in the community.

86
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:02.100
So here's what happens. You, you have, um,

87
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.630
thousands of family owned papers and cities around the country that got

88
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:10.680
consolidated into a conglomerate at some point it's called good net or, uh,

89
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.330
or one of these. Um,

90
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.040
and then ganache fell on hard times and was then bought by a

91
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.910
private equity fund or hedge fund at South private equity fund typically. Um,

92
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.700
and the private equity fund then owns a bunch of papers and then rings them for

93
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:27.810
cash. They look around and say, Ooh, like I have economies of scale. Um,

94
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.160
and then if someone raised their hand is like,

95
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.170
I'd like to report on my local school board and be like, well,

96
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:36.000
that has zero economies of scale, so no you're out. Um,

97
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.420
but, but now they're looking around for an exit. They're looking around saying,

98
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:41.970
what the heck do I do with my investment? Because this has not worked out.

99
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.790
Even my ringing for cash ruthlessness has not worked out.

100
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.850
And so if you give them an easy way out and say,

101
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:52.230
why don't just give that paper back to the community with five Oh one C3,

102
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.140
there's some local stakeholders and we'll cash you out.

103
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.590
Not so you make out like a bandit, but that,

104
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:01.760
that you actually make it out alive. Um,

105
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.530
that would be such an enormous win.

106
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.050
I thought this was the most genius idea and the whole thing.

107
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.360
<v 1>Oh, well, thank you. I wrote it. No I didn't. Um, but I agree.</v>

108
00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:13.330
I really agree. I think you're totally right. The, um,

109
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.350
those are the group of us that were advising Steve and working with him on this

110
00:06:17.351 --> 00:06:21.910
are very concerned about what the risk is also for the exit that

111
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:23.080
these, um,

112
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.640
private equity firms are gonna pursue that own a significant number of the

113
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.740
highly trusted brands in our country.

114
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.720
And we know that there's a big risk of a bad outcome because we know as

115
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.370
you alluded to that, there are bad actors who are, uh, on, on both.

116
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.690
I mean, bad actors,

117
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.700
PR propagandists advocacy efforts that are starting

118
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.740
new local news brands and allowing them to spew partisan

119
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.420
nonsense, um,

120
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:56.380
instead of fact-checked stories that actually bring people together.

121
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.480
And so those actors, you know, exist out there. There is a fear that is,

122
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:05.800
I don't think unwarranted that the, when the exit happens,

123
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.570
the papers go into the wrong hands. And so I thought Steve's idea here.

124
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.630
The replanting idea is really a genius idea to, um,

125
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.310
because it says let's incentivize a different outcome with.

126
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.920
<v 0>An example from the presidential trail that maybe folks, um, uh,</v>

127
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.020
will take to, uh,

128
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.940
the main paper that all the presidential candidates wanted to, um,

129
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.580
get coverage in was the Des Moines register, uh,

130
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.460
because it's the biggest circulation in Iowa.

131
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:38.950
And obviously I was the first state and the rest of it.

132
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.370
So we can just hang out with them all the time, um, or try to.

133
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.210
And so they wrote a good story about you. You are very, very pleased and, uh,

134
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.890
like your staff was very happy. De Moines register was bought by one of these,

135
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.570
uh, private equity firms, uh, and like tacked onto its, you know,

136
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.250
several hundred newspaper collection

137
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.190
while I was running. And so the journalist I was talking to was there,

138
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.200
it was like, well, we're not sure what's going to happen. Now.

139
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.320
We just got new ownership and like, it wasn't like a hip hip, hooray,

140
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.690
we got new ownership. It was like, Oh, like, you know,

141
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:13.630
I might lose my job kind of situation. Um, so,

142
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:17.200
so these are the folks that we've been relying upon, um,

143
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.670
for generations to help vet,

144
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.110
uh, national candidates who come through. Uh,

145
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.730
and so if you start doing a number on even massive pillars of local

146
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:33.430
journalism, like the Des Moines register, like where, where do you,

147
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.340
where does it end? It ends in tears, uh, really,

148
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:38.740
or it ends in an information wasteland. And like you said,

149
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.173
propagandists will fill that.

150
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.410
<v 1>And I'm really worried right now. And I actually started a third, um,</v>

151
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.540
pro organization, um, the last month because, uh, okay. Think back to,

152
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.370
um, 2000, the last time we had a contested presidential election,

153
00:08:54.371 --> 00:08:58.080
which it possible that we're going to have again. Um,

154
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.300
and it came down to Florida. Um, the, the apparatus at that time of the,

155
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.860
of the newspapers in Florida was so strong and robust, like,

156
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.720
um, in the Miami Herald, I think had about 350 person newsroom at the time.

157
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.590
And they just went to town, making sure that, um, you know,

158
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.730
people understood what a hanging Chad was and they were in the room watching the

159
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.760
Chad's hang or whatever was actually going on. And, and that's,

160
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.590
that's like really, um,

161
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.300
you can't underestimate the difference between what the, the rest of us were.

162
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.050
We were just to kind of sitting at home, watching CNN here or,

163
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.370
or whatever we're watching now, um, Twitch here, uh,

164
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.420
when we're having it explained to us what, what is going on.

165
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.430
If there are people who are in the national stage have that behind

166
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:52.290
them have like all that 350 person newsroom that like understands

167
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:52.940
the,

168
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.780
the arcane details of local politics and local election administration versus

169
00:09:57.781 --> 00:10:01.710
today, the Miami Herald newsroom is under a hundred people.

170
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:04.560
It's probably about 50 people. I mean, that's,

171
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.510
that's just like unreal to think about what's going to happen.

172
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.680
And it's like, we are in a much more insecure and unstable, um,

173
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:18.090
situation in terms of, uh, challenges to the integrity of the election.

174
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:22.650
Because one of the two candidates for president has already decided he doesn't

175
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:23.281
trust the outcome.

176
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:27.960
Plus a pandemic has made a lot of Americans wonder if they can trust the

177
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:32.280
outcome, adding on to that, like the history of voter suppression.

178
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.610
And that, that has been kind of opened up a little bit with,

179
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:39.990
by certain court moves. And so all of that, um,

180
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.050
is really scary situation like even right now,

181
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.550
because the people that are going to be explaining all of this to us have even

182
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:51.630
less firsthand independent accounts to rely on, which is why.

183
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.380
<v 0>He said, they'll all be parachuting. And then, uh, you know,</v>

184
00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:57.230
you get there and like, who's there, what's the record.

185
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.210
<v 1>And we already saw that happen in the primaries people, the, the, you know, you,</v>

186
00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:06.740
you, it, I love journalists. I am a journalist. And I want to say,

187
00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:07.760
you can always believe journalists,

188
00:11:07.761 --> 00:11:10.490
but you actually can't always believe journalists because sometimes they do

189
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:14.330
parachute and we do do that. And we don't know what we're talking about.

190
00:11:14.331 --> 00:11:15.920
And it's dangerous to say,

191
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.690
to scare people about things that you don't actually need to be scared about,

192
00:11:20.691 --> 00:11:22.940
but it's also, um, dangerous to,

193
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.830
to relieve big people feel relief when they shouldn't. I mean, it's just a bad,

194
00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:31.910
bad situation. So, um, so the, I was like up, yeah.

195
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.600
<v 0>I think journalists have been getting a bad rap. Um,</v>

196
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.750
but I think a lot of the bad rap they've been getting does not apply to local

197
00:11:38.751 --> 00:11:40.730
journalists earlier point it's like we,

198
00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:44.540
we chose sort of trust local journalists in a different way than we do. Um,

199
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.000
some of the national media figures and the national media figures,

200
00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:51.920
a lot of the economic incentives are around feeding into the polarization

201
00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:56.770
narratives, unfortunately, and those incentives do not tend to exist locally.

202
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.050
Like if you're a small town paper,

203
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.820
the last thing you're going to do is being like,

204
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.120
we're the small town paper that only half of you are going to like.

205
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.820
<v 2>Your recipe for success.</v>

206
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.830
<v 1>I mean, like obviously there's exceptions to every rule,</v>

207
00:12:13.831 --> 00:12:17.160
but the truth is that. Yeah, I agree with you. And that's so,

208
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.810
so I started a project Andrew called vote beat where we are deploying

209
00:12:21.811 --> 00:12:26.220
local reporters because in the pandemic we've seen just hundreds and hundreds of

210
00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:29.130
reporters for a load from their jobs who have, um,

211
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.230
for local reporters who have this deep,

212
00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:34.770
trusted relationships in their communities. They have a lot of local knowledge,

213
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.780
but they're not working. And then there's this craziness that we have to cover.

214
00:12:39.781 --> 00:12:40.530
So yeah.

215
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.320
<v 0>You're matching the resources to the need nicely done. Uh, and,</v>

216
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:46.800
and it's one reason why we have to act fast Elizabeth,

217
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.750
because these reporters expertise will not be there forever. Uh,

218
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.130
you know, the ability to replant these papers will not last forever.

219
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.950
Um, w w we have a window of time that we have to run through a window

220
00:13:01.951 --> 00:13:04.400
of opportunity. Uh, and I,

221
00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:07.920
I applaud you for leading on this issue. Um,

222
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.530
certainly before I'd figured it out, um,

223
00:13:10.531 --> 00:13:14.520
we need to try and get more resources to the American journalism project.

224
00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:18.420
We need to pass the local journalism sustainability act. If we do that,

225
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.790
then we'd have a real chance, um,

226
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.260
at having people like you covering important issues

227
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.850
in communities for decades and generations, instead of seeing it with her away.

228
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.950
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
