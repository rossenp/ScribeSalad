1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>There's like this tone I've seen in some of the media coverage where it's like,</v>

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:07.710
Hey, some jerks want to reopen schools.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.110
And then the media organizations are like casting that as, uh,

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.720
a terrible idea and dangerous. And then as usual,

5
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.040
the truth lies somewhere in between. Um, so first, can we lay out the case?

6
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.670
Why frankly, kids actually benefit from school or need school, like schools are,

7
00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:31.620
are, uh, are like a huge value add on several levels?

8
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.350
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I think that there's,</v>

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.590
there's this sort of kid case in the kind of economy case for why we have

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.830
schools. And so I think on the, on the kids side, um,

11
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.790
one clear thing is that kids learn better in schools. So we saw this, you know,

12
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:47.180
we, I mean, that's should be sort of obvious. Um, but even if you sort of,

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.140
if you look for a data from the spring about kind of what happened to metrics of

14
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:55.490
learning, uh, when kids went remote, you know, they, they went down a lot. Uh,

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.520
kids do not learn as well, uh, as well remotely.

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.230
And that is particularly true for students who have fewer resources. Uh,

17
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.660
and so that, I mean, the,

18
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:07.250
the kind of potential learning loss is in the inequality,

19
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:12.230
in those learning losses. If we, you know, if we are fully online or, um,

20
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.870
with kind of, no, as we were in the spring,

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
the potential losses for the year are very, are very significant.

22
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.020
So I think there's just like huge value for kids in being in school.

23
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.420
And it isn't just learning. It's also socialization, you know,

24
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:26.720
sort of thinking about like, what is your five-year-old getting out of,

25
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.240
out of school? Yeah. Part of it is like they're learning to read,

26
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:30.074
they're learning their letters.

27
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.830
Part of it is that they're learning to like operate in the operate in the world.

28
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.220
Um,

29
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.830
we don't know that much about what's going to happen if we lose those things.

30
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:40.070
But I think we have a sense that, that they're, that they're important.

31
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.020
And then there's this sort of separate issue,

32
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:45.350
which is just schools are the kind of childcare that a lot of people are using.

33
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.980
So if we want people to be able to go to their jobs and the, you know,

34
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:51.380
participate in the economy, particularly women,

35
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.710
we need to figure out something for their kids to be doing during the day.

36
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:57.920
And if that's not school, I don't know what it's, uh, what it's going to be.

37
00:01:57.921 --> 00:01:58.311
But, you know,

38
00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:01.290
I think people have bristled this idea that like school is childcare like, Oh,

39
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.480
what school is not childcare? Well.

40
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.430
<v 0>School is definitely childcare people.</v>

41
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.440
<v 1>It is. I mean, it's not pejorative, it's not, it's not meant to be pejorative,</v>

42
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.590
but it is, it is a thing that people are using for childcare, for sure.

43
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.540
And I think it's important to recognize that.

44
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.860
<v 0>Um, yeah, you know, not this extreme end, um, my wife,</v>

45
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:23.180
Evelyn said something because she's always looking out for, um, for kids,

46
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.410
you said like schools are an abuse detector where if you are,

47
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.080
um, uh, mistreating your child,

48
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.410
like the most common place people are going to pick up on it is when their kid

49
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:36.620
goes to school and that they have like a bruise or marking or they seem

50
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:41.510
traumatized. Uh, so you know, like it's, it's childcare. Yes. I mean,

51
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:45.110
that's just a factual, uh, reality,

52
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:48.350
but it's also in some cases, even like a safeguard or a Haven.

53
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.880
<v 1>And it's a place, people get food, right. I mean, sort of look at like what,</v>

54
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.090
you know, what happened to food insecurity over the last, uh, you know,

55
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:58.340
over this, this last period, you know, many,

56
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:00.490
many more kids are going hungry because you know,

57
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.250
the school lunch program is serving, you know, millions,

58
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.730
tens of millions of kids every, every day. And,

59
00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:08.500
and I think part of what's missing from some of these conversations is a lot of

60
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.820
the people having these conversations are, are, it's not,

61
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.320
they don't care about these issues, but they're not living them. Right.

62
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.480
So we're having this conversation. And like, the truth is like,

63
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.660
if my kids don't go to school, that is going to be annoying for me, but it,

64
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.310
it is not, you know, there's.

65
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.210
<v 0>It's essential, it's not priceless.</v>

66
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.261
<v 1>Exactly.</v>

67
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:28.050
And a lot of the people who are having these conversations are in that role.

68
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:28.950
And so we're sort of like,

69
00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:33.870
it's hard to really visualize quite how bad this may turn out to be for

70
00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:36.540
kids who are in a very different situation.

71
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.270
<v 0>So let's see if we can try and define the impact of an extended summer slump,</v>

72
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.250
because I know when kids go off for the summer and they're,

73
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:49.770
they're not doing a whole lot, um, that there's some data around,

74
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.000
um, the fact they forget stuff. Uh, the fact that they learned things.

75
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:57.450
So let's say we extended the summer slump by several months for the spring,

76
00:03:57.451 --> 00:04:01.200
which we probably did. Uh, like, do we have any sense of, of how,

77
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.180
and as a parent, um, my kids haven't learned for like, quite some time.

78
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.150
It's like, like they, they, you have online school, but like, uh, I mean,

79
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.890
it's not a great and, uh, like, and anyone who's out there first,

80
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.390
actually let's unpack that for a moment because there are a lot of, um,

81
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.890
like a techno optimists who are like, Hey, um,

82
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.770
online school is the future. Online school is the bomb.

83
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:31.410
Why do we even send kids to school? Like online is a way,

84
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.390
do we have data on that? Aside from my anecdotal, um, since, uh,

85
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.780
that my kids have not been exactly like, uh, you know,

86
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.670
tearing the world up over the last number of months.

87
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.540
<v 1>I mean, I think the best data I've seen on this was put out by, um,</v>

88
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.020
actually one of my colleagues, who's an opportunity insights, uh,

89
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:49.950
and they use data from Zearn,

90
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.830
which is an online math platform that's linked to your Brega.

91
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:56.190
So it's actually a platform, a lot of schools use. Um, so it's basically,

92
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.400
so Eureka is like a standard math curriculum. And then Zearn is this like,

93
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.540
like online portal where you basically like kids can sort of self learn in,

94
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.820
in German. A lot of schools use it in the school.

95
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.850
And what's really nice about it is you can track progress,

96
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:11.250
really granularly because there's like these badges.

97
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:12.990
So you can see like at the end of each lesson,

98
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:14.970
like you do this activity and then you earn a badge.

99
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.150
So you can see like how quickly are kids learning, he's earning these badges.

100
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.621
Uh, and so they,

101
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.590
they look at sort of what happens to kids who are enrolled in schools who are

102
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:25.530
using zones. So the school is using Zearn before and after.

103
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.970
And they can see like what happens to the number of badges and in, you know,

104
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.530
schools in high-income districts, the, there is some learning loss that share,

105
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.210
you know, the like badge earning goes down by like, I dunno, 30%, uh,

106
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.880
or something in, in schools, in low income districts.

107
00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:44.580
And this isn't low-income kids, it's just schools in low-income districts.

108
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:49.110
So it's going down by about 70%. So like, yeah.

109
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.960
So it's basically like people, I know some people have said, well,

110
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.780
like maybe people are, you know, have moved to other, I mean,

111
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:56.490
this sort of like technological, like,

112
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.590
and people move to even better systems for remote learning. I think.

113
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.193
<v 0>No.</v>

114
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.720
<v 1>Your transition would be an online math platform that you are already using.</v>

115
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.831
If you ask, like,

116
00:06:08.831 --> 00:06:11.890
what is the thing that is going to be the most successful in moving to remote

117
00:06:11.891 --> 00:06:13.930
learning, it would be things that are already on the computer.

118
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.020
And so I think that, that, that gives you a sense. I mean,

119
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:21.220
if you kind of translate that up to the whole year, I mean, this is like a,

120
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.540
like an unbelievably large amount of learning loss beyond the summer slump,

121
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.493
which is already there.

122
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.030
<v 0>Yes. So,</v>

123
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.750
so it sounds like if you had to just throw in a couple of numbers that you could

124
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:35.560
be like, look, um, these kids are learning math, uh,

125
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.850
at 30 to 70% less efficient or slower rates

126
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.570
than had been the case when they were in in-person schools as like a,

127
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:47.140
just a general estimate, which jives with my sense of reality.

128
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.880
Like if you were to tell me, Hey, their learning is slowing up by 30 to 70%. Um,

129
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.990
I would agree. Uh, and what, what you said about, uh,

130
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.950
the social operating system, my kids get in school. So I,

131
00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:00.850
I was a very nerdy kid. Um,

132
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.240
and so I think that's mainly what I got out of school.

133
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.110
It was trying to like traffic God, like, what the heck is going on?

134
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:11.920
Why is this kid, um, you know, seem to be mad at me or whatever, like, uh,

135
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.060
you know, like that, that kind of interaction. Um, and for my kids too,

136
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:19.450
like when they're online learning, uh, it's really, you know,

137
00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:21.670
they're not learning that and they just like wander off.

138
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.640
I can actually sense my kids and becoming less, uh,

139
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:28.690
with it or personable because they're just not forced to interact with a whole

140
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:29.740
lot of other people.

141
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.190
And I'm sure parents around the country are experiencing the same thing.

142
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.890
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I think that people's, you know,</v>

143
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.580
it's sort of been interesting in a negative way for many of us to kind of

144
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:43.930
realize the ways that our kids deal with this, which is mostly not good.

145
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.221
Um, but you know,

146
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:48.970
there are sort of kids like who are super social for whom I think this has been

147
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.840
like, obviously very like hard, you know, it's sort of like just very hard.

148
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.960
They're moody, they're angry. They're, you know, they're depressed.

149
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:58.720
Like they just can't, can't see people. And then I think there are other kids,

150
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.390
um, I think at least one of my kids a little bit more like this,

151
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:04.330
and maybe this is one of yours where on the one hand actually seems fine.

152
00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:05.710
Like they seem pretty happy,

153
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.600
but you can sort of see that there are things about interacting with other

154
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:12.100
people that they're starting to like,

155
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.300
do their like skills at doing are starting to decay. Yeah. Right. And then,

156
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.630
you know, when my kids went back to camp, it's actually like I did,

157
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.160
and that they were around other kids.

158
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.240
I realized how much they had missed that and how much, you know,

159
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:28.600
for my five-year-old like, like re-engaging with the question of like, okay,

160
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:33.110
what is an appropriate amount of wrestling to do with another kid? Um, you know,

161
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.480
and like, how am I supposed to, like,

162
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.910
for him sort of like monitoring his behavior is,

163
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.120
is a thing like all five-year-old boys. Like we, we work on,

164
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:43.840
I realized we'd sort of like not had any of that. Um,

165
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.730
and I think that that is a big piece of, I mean, it was a big piece for me of,

166
00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:51.100
of learning in school. Um, like how do I deal with other people?
