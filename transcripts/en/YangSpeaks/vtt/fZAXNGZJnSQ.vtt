00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>Alex would love to hear about your journey and how you also came to</v>

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.560
join this coalition of mayors for a guaranteed income.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.840
<v 1>Holyoke's a city of 40,000 people right outside Springfield. And I say it's a,</v>

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.060
a small city with big city challenges.

5
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.390
We were once the paper city of the entire country,

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.050
the first planned industrial city in the United States.

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.910
And because the forces of capitalism and globalization, we fell on hard times.

8
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:29.270
Those factories, shuttered jobs moved down South and overseas.

9
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:32.750
At the very time new people came to our community. And today we're, we're,

10
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.700
we're largely more 50% Latino,

11
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.870
mostly in Puerto Rican descent and the jobs that were once available to Irish

12
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.320
immigrants and Polish immigrants were not available to Puerto Rican migrants in

13
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.870
our, in our community. And so for years,

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.940
policymakers and mayors have struggled with, well,

15
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:50.360
how do we create jobs and build wealth for people in our community?

16
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.580
And when I think about the fact that we focused on entrepreneurship and built

17
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:58.760
in wealth building opportunities for, for people in our community, not,

18
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.640
not sort of seeking large corporations coming in,

19
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.800
so our residents can make a minimum wage jobs,

20
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:07.070
but how do we give people the tools they need to start their own business and

21
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.930
build wealth for themselves and for their families.

22
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.800
It's why I'm a strong supporter of a single payer healthcare system and why I'm

23
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:16.670
a strong supporter of a, of a guaranteed income in the middle of this pandemic.

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.990
While our federal government seems more concerned with bailing out corporations

25
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:23.450
and institutions and businesses, you know,

26
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:26.270
we need to fight for people's bailout people here in Holyoke.

27
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.910
We already have a high population of folks that are food insecure,

28
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.020
housing insecure that are concerned with how to put food on the table and pay

29
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:34.820
their rent, pay their mortgage.

30
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.230
And now with the incredible reduction in the economy,

31
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:42.530
the fact that our economy is shrunk by what, over 33% in the last quarter,

32
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.610
our GDP by 10%, our economy is not going to return to the way it was before.

33
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.590
And so we were already forced to redefine what, what productivity was,

34
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.960
who capitalism was serving. And now it's even more pronounced, um, in,

35
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:59.240
in communities like Holyoke and communities across the country.

36
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.450
And so this is really about, you know, as, as mayor Brown said,

37
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.650
basic humanity and dignity for our people and what choices people can make.

38
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.750
Like you, can you start that business? Can you be a mother or a father and,

39
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800
and take care of your kids at the same time,

40
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:16.940
or do you have to choose between working to provide for your family or being

41
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:21.470
there for your child and no person in this country and the wealthiest country on

42
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:25.540
earth, you'd have to make that decision. And clearly we're, ill-prepared, uh,

43
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.790
in terms of policy and legislation to meet families where they're at,

44
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.690
then I'm running against a member of Congress that takes the most amount of

45
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:36.200
corporate money of any member of the house, Democrat and Republican.

46
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.080
You just took the top spot away from Republican Kevin McCarthy,

47
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.440
and that's from wall street and big pharma and pharmaceutical companies.

48
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.090
And he's even, again,

49
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.210
publicly denounced and come out against the paycheck guarantee act,

50
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.390
he's come out against monthly recurring emergency payments throughout the

51
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:53.570
duration of this pandemic. And even has the goal of the site that site,

52
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.470
the deficit, you know, something oftentimes reserved for folks on the right.

53
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:01.300
And so he just fails to meet the urgency of this moment. And, you know,

54
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.510
it's time we actually send unbutton Democrats to Washington.

55
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.800
It's not enough to be a Democrat.

56
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.680
You have to be a Democrat that actually wants to represent and fight for people.

57
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.990
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
