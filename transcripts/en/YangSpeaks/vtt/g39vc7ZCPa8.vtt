1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>We've had breaking news. Andrew a lot has happened since our last episode.</v>

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.200
<v 1>Yes. Kamala Harris, vice president Biden,</v>

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.470
Harris ticket. Uh, I'm excited. No,

4
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:17.010
I got to know comma lawyer very well on the rail. It's funny like the,

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.040
the different candidates. Uh, you're literally side by side,

6
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.590
uh, in, in the case of me and Commonwealth, I think,

7
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.650
or was it a debate neighbor multiple times now,

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.580
one time I smuggled a handkerchief on stage for, uh, she was just like, yay.

9
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.160
I was like, sure. You know, uh, um, but, but more than that,

10
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.920
we, uh,

11
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.820
were in Iowa back to back multiple times, uh,

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.470
really much more Iowa than anything else.

13
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.950
Cause she spent a lot of time there and I did too. Um,

14
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.240
but we have each other's, uh, contact info.

15
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.220
I got to know her husband, um, too on the trail. Doug, who's a great guy. Uh,

16
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.140
I'm excited. I think the Biden Harris ticket is really hard to beat,

17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.640
you know, it's like, it, it feels balanced and comma is a freaking

18
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.490
powerhouse where like she'll, she'll, she will be very,

19
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:17.960
very strong on the trail and make a lot of people very excited. Uh,

20
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.730
so it it's it's great.

21
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:24.500
And the most important thing always to me was Joe's desire for the right

22
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.890
partner because he wanted someone, he had the right relationship with.

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.850
And it seems like he had a relationship with Kamala from way back because she

24
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:35.720
was friends with his son Beau and he was attorney general and she was an

25
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:40.100
attorney general. Uh, so yeah, you know, it, it's a phenomenal picture.

26
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.270
<v 0>In terms of your relationships with candidates on the trail. You were closest,</v>

27
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:48.410
I thought with Joe Camila and maybe Tulsi.

28
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.780
<v 1>Corey Booker, sorry.</v>

29
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.120
<v 0>You're right. Um, so, uh, I selfishly from Andrew Yang perspective,</v>

30
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:57.050
this is pretty cool. Cause you're,

31
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.030
you're friendly with her are friends with her. Um,

32
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.840
but thoughts on the strategy of this? Like in what,

33
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.490
what do you think besides do I like the person?

34
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.700
Do I think they're a good leader. What do you think from a political standpoint,

35
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.090
optic standpoint, what are your thoughts on, on the Camila pic?

36
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.560
<v 1>I think there's a really great balance again, where you have, uh,</v>

37
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.940
Joe who's older than two of Kamala was, uh,

38
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:24.860
it was like a generation younger. Uh, you have obviously the gender dynamic,

39
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.250
the race dynamic, uh, it's very balanced. Uh,

40
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.470
there's even a little bit of an East coast, West coast thing going.

41
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.290
<v 0>The, the right. I watched Fox news last night,</v>

42
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.320
cause I'm always so interested in what they say about the VP pick and they

43
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:38.540
already have tried to brand her and bench Bureau came out.

44
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.240
Same thing said comma is a radical lefty.

45
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.970
And to me that branding does not stick.

46
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.130
I think she's really as moderate as they come.

47
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.710
I think it's insane to try and call her that. I mean, yes,

48
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:52.520
she's had some California policies she's kind of been wrapped up in or just by

49
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:57.350
being us Senator from the San Francisco or Bay area, um, is one thing,

50
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:01.330
but he an attorney general, uh, there is no,

51
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.740
she's a very moderate sensible politician. Um, so I think that won't stick.

52
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.700
I don't know, to me she's already been branded and throwing the nonsense at her.

53
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:13.540
Won't stick the way it might with some of the other lesser known VP candidates

54
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.374
he was considering.

55
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.140
<v 1>Yeah. I think they have to try that. I don't think it's correct or effective.</v>

56
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.080
Uh, but you know, at this point they're in desperation mode.

57
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.700
<v 0>Yeah. It was, it was fascinating like Hannity and Laura Ingram were like,</v>

58
00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:29.760
this is the most radical ticket that Democrats have ever run. And you're like.

59
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.570
<v 1>I really think that's correct.</v>

60
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.470
<v 0>Oh, I don't know how many moderates are really watching Fox news anymore,</v>

61
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.380
but I don't, I don't know. But, um, that doesn't feel right.

62
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:45.140
So congrats to Camila and her team. Um, and I'm,

63
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.300
I'm excited. I think this is a solid pick and we're and look, the other thing,

64
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:49.050
the other fact,

65
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.010
the other piece of this is that all of the Democrats fell in line,

66
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.790
which I think is rare. Like we usually have rifts in our party. Um,

67
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.170
and that was nice to see the rest of the democratic leadership and candidates

68
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:04.020
all come out and support her and Joe with you pick.

69
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.701
<v 1>Yeah. I agree.</v>

70
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:10.350
Congrats to Kamala and Doug and the whole team and win this thing.

71
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.140
<v 0>Yeah. So we're going to help, which is exciting,</v>

72
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.680
which brings me to other forms of helping and probably one of the reasons many

73
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:21.240
of you tuned in because yesterday hashtag let yang

74
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.300
speak DNC was trending.

75
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.460
I think it got up to number three in politics and trader,

76
00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:29.220
but it was like it's top 10 and Twitter, at least in the United States.

77
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.350
So that the high level overview is that the DNC came out with their ma let's

78
00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:36.270
call it their speaker card. Um,

79
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:39.000
of who's speaking all four days during the DNC convention.

80
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:40.560
And we were left off that list,

81
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.860
which was a bit of a shock to us because we've been in conversations with the

82
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:45.300
DNC, um,

83
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.500
about speaking and have been given what seems to be some prime time slots

84
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.340
throughout the week. We are expected to speak at the convention, be a member.

85
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:57.330
So, and then you tweeted out, um, you know, if I'm honest,

86
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.820
I was expecting to speak in a sense of,

87
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.150
should speak with the people on that list. So your react,

88
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.660
I think the world is interested in your, your real reaction and also why this,

89
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.350
um, why this matters to you and to frankly, our supporters.

90
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.730
<v 1>I commented to a journalist that it's not like you or</v>

91
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:21.480
me were jumping up and down, like yelling at anyone's ear, being like, Oh,

92
00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:25.530
we need this spot. We need that. That's not. Uh, yeah. Um,

93
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.240
but that there is like a real sense that we have a lot of people that, uh,

94
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.890
supported my campaign. Many of whom were on the fence about Joe. Uh,

95
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.420
and I've been telling them we need to get by and Joan, uh, get Trump out.

96
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.230
Uh, and I, I said, this makes that case a little bit harder to make,

97
00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:47.730
because one reason why people who supported me would support Joe is like, okay,

98
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:52.320
if yang is a big part of the team, then we can advance some of the,

99
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.100
um, ideas and policies that I ran on. It's just harder case to make.

100
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.720
If it seems like we are not being included.

101
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.760
Uh, and to your point, it's like,

102
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.840
I thought we were being included that that was like the mystery. And it's like,

103
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.790
Oh, like, Hey, like what, what, what transpires here? I want to be clear.

104
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.320
<v 0>Listening. It's it's not about us. Um, like, would you like to speak? Sure.</v>

105
00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.670
But that's not the point of this.

106
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.370
The point is we have a powerful message and a lot of people that supported it

107
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.110
and wanted this voice heard.

108
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.260
<v 1>It was actually really touching the outpouring of support. So thank you.</v>

109
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.260
If you were part of it, but like that boring. I was bored yesterday. I was like,

110
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.320
wow. I'm like, that's so, uh, it was hilarious.

111
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.480
<v 0>People that will need it on you forever.</v>

112
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.450
People have hated on you forever on MSNBC. I'll remain nameless,

113
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:39.670
but they came out and they were like, Andrew, Yang's beyond it.

114
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.200
This is ridiculous. Like that to me was, um,

115
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.090
I don't know, funny and kind of case in point.

116
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.730
<v 1>Gratifying, I was like, Oh, thank you. That's so kind of really like,</v>

117
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:58.510
it did reflect on it for a minute. Um, because, uh, you know,

118
00:06:58.511 --> 00:07:02.620
there are other folks that are also not on the program that ran and, um,

119
00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:04.990
the fact that there doesn't seem to be much of an outcry.

120
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.910
It was really touching to me. I was like, Oh wow.

121
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:10.060
Like people recognize what we did. Yeah.

122
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.860
So thank you to everyone who helped me make that happen. Um, yeah.

123
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:17.770
We're, we're keeping, making things happening every day.

124
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.390
<v 0>Twitter went nuts. Here we are. We'll be involved in the convention somehow.</v>

125
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.680
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
