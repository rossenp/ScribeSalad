1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>We are going to see and are seeing a bunch of jobs get automated in a shock-like</v>

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.780
way, because people need to find ways,

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:09.900
at least in the near future to do things with less human contact between human

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:13.170
beings. And we're seeing this moment,

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.390
that is a very deep reminder that people don't have

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.950
control over their economic fortunes, that all of a sudden,

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.500
a pandemic virus or something,

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.220
a technological dance could happen in your industry that, that lays you off,

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.500
or that destroys the economy in your town.

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.750
And so you really get into, I think your argument now for,

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.830
for UBI, um, which AI coronavirus,

12
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:45.660
like these things begin to almost operate as like metaphors for just a

13
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:48.660
shock and what happens to people during a shock.

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.200
And do you want to leave it up to Congress to argue about expanding UI benefits

15
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.034
during a shock?

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.300
So there's been a lot of movement actually in the Andrew Yang direction,

17
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.950
or as I often like to think about it,

18
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:03.510
the anti Lowery direction towards just giving people money, um, during this, uh,

19
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.620
during this pandemic,

20
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
and that's been a real policy shift that is not how we've done things during

21
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:09.960
past crises.

22
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.690
So I'd like to hear you talk a little bit about why you think that's happened

23
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.940
and what you think we can learn from its performance so far.

24
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.720
<v 1>I'm very happy for it to be the anti Lowery direction.</v>

25
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.680
And certainly, you know, I'm thrilled about anyone who gets on board,

26
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.960
doesn't matter why or what you call it. You know,

27
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.930
that there are now dozens of mayors around the country who are championing

28
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.110
guaranteed income, Michael Tubbs the original,

29
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:36.350
but there are now dozens of folks, Keisha Lance bottoms, uh,

30
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.560
Eric Arcedi and around the country who are committed to universal basic income

31
00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:40.310
pilots.

32
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.820
And the reason as well is that now it's just common sense where you look around

33
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:45.890
and you see that there are tens of millions of Americans.

34
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.270
Who've gotten shoved out of the labor force because we don't need as many

35
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.010
bartenders, airline, attendants, security guards, ushers,

36
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.600
personal trainers,

37
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.860
you name it like there's so many jobs that required physical proximity that now

38
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.680
does don't make sense. And like you said, it's not no one's fault.

39
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.750
And so then you look around and say,

40
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.710
how are we going to get economic resources into the hands of these millions of

41
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:10.544
people?

42
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.500
And cash relief is the only sensible solution and $1,200 in

43
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.970
April. Uh,

44
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.470
going out had a really positive effect on many households and on

45
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.000
propping up our economy,

46
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.980
but we need to make that regular recurring predictable we've been

47
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.890
living off of the first cares act.

48
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.920
But then now that benefits have elapsed,

49
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.510
you're going to see distress and disintegration pick up in many,

50
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:40.070
many households and communities.

51
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.630
And there really is no feasible way to help so many households manage this

52
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.390
except for direct cash relief. And it's not just you,

53
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.660
me and Annie and mayor Tubbs at this point last I saw

54
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.510
76% of Americans are pro cash relief during the pandemic.

55
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.400
Uh, and 55% are now universal basic income.

56
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.590
So it's no longer the magical Asian man making this case.

57
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.940
It's the majority of Americans realize it's common sense and something we need

58
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:10.530
to do.

59
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.390
<v 0>So there's a big jump between using cash transfer for</v>

60
00:03:15.391 --> 00:03:17.760
relief, which is what we've seen during the pandemic. And as you say,

61
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.810
it's already, uh,

62
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.540
as Mo Republican's already moved into a stance of opposition on it,

63
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.010
even though the pandemic is ongoing and moving to a basic income floor

64
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.930
and right in the middle of that jump is this argument that Republicans are

65
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.670
making on the UI on the unemployment insurance, why they won't extend the $600,

66
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.650
which is that if people can get paid and can

67
00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:43.800
support themselves in their lives without working, they won't work.

68
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.320
And the point of American economic policy should be getting as many

69
00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:54.300
people to work as we can, no matter what, no matter what job they have to take.

70
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.150
And so what is your argument to them?

71
00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:00.480
What is your argument to Republicans who say, look, relief is fine,

72
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.650
but we do not want to be paying people not to work because we want people

73
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:05.484
working.

74
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.860
<v 1>Agree and say,</v>

75
00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:12.480
the last thing you want to do is tie economic relief to job status or

76
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:16.590
employment status. So if you put cash into someone's hands and say,

77
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.860
you can have this cash, unless you start working. Um,

78
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.840
then it actually is a detriment to them going back out there as quickly as

79
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:26.310
possible. In some cases, I mean,

80
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:30.030
most people will still just be panicking until they find a job. And so to me,

81
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:34.530
this effect is overstated and overblown. Uh, but the extended exists.

82
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.060
You are right now tying a lot of this cash to employment status, I would say,

83
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:43.020
make the cash unconditional, and then you'll have a baseline.

84
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:45.240
And if you go out and get that part-time job,

85
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.170
because it's not ready to be a full-time job because the bowling alley or the

86
00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:52.620
retail store is not at full reopening yet,

87
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.180
then you get to keep that money as opposed to right now saying, well,

88
00:04:57.181 --> 00:05:00.180
wait a minute. If I take this job, then I stopped getting benefits.

89
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.930
So the problem right now is our existing legacy

90
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.490
infrastructure that ties the cash relief to not working.

91
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.600
<v 0>I think the U S government has a spending constraint on it. Could,</v>

92
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.280
could we do a UBI and a green, new deal and Medicare for all?

93
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.070
And just put it on the, put on the national credit card or do we have

94
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.160
limited resources? And we have to make choices between them.

95
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.190
<v 1>The argument I made on the trail as are, um, which, uh,</v>

96
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.480
I sent you to agree with is that we have a revenue problem in that the biggest

97
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:37.800
winners in the 21st century economy are paying zero or near zero in taxes very

98
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:40.620
often. And the most prominent example is Amazon,

99
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:44.610
the trillion dollar company that paid zero in federal taxes last year.

100
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.440
And so what I said to folks is like, look,

101
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.930
if you have Amazon paying zero in taxes,

102
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.970
you're going to have affordability problems for sure.

103
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.430
And that if you harness the gains from the Amazons and apples and

104
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.213
Netflix's of the world,

105
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.340
then you have a lot more revenue to work with very quickly.

106
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.250
And then if you put that money into people's hands,

107
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.750
that money does not disappear.

108
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.920
It ends up going right back into the local economy,

109
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:14.390
in the form of car repairs and daycare expenses and the

110
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.950
occasional meal out.

111
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.650
And those businesses all then create more opportunities and can create

112
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:23.750
virtuous cycles, uh,

113
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.190
that help end up creating jobs and human

114
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.311
wellbeing. But the,

115
00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:33.710
the big thing as where I think is that we need to stop measuring our

116
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.500
economy in terms of these narrow economic outputs,

117
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.690
where if you try to figure out what's good for us by what's good

118
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:46.490
for the stock market, then you're lost. Uh, and so if we wait.

119
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.830
<v 0>No, but I'm going to hold you on.</v>

120
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:49.810
I'm going to hold you on this argument before you go into it,

121
00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:50.860
because I want to stay on the,

122
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.550
I'm not measuring our economy by narrow economic outputs by GDP right here.

123
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:58.330
I'm the question I'm asking is, um, is can we afford it?

124
00:06:58.331 --> 00:07:01.060
I know we need to pay for it. Yeah. Do we need to pay for things like this?

125
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:04.900
And what I would say is I know the, the, the corporate tax data on this stuff,

126
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.261
you know,

127
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:10.210
well enough to say that the list of things I just gave you Medicare for all UBI

128
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:11.170
and green new deal,

129
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.520
you could do everything that the folks I know who want to tax

130
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:18.880
corporations and rich people quite a bit more think we should do.

131
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:20.590
And in most cases, I want to do those things too,

132
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.500
and you wouldn't come near paying for the set of things. So,

133
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:24.580
so at some point you have to,

134
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.760
there is a question of whether or not these things are worth raising taxes,

135
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:31.210
for which I often think they are. Um, but taxes are our hard sell.

136
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:34.930
And then there's a question which you will sometimes hear people associate with

137
00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:37.060
modern monetary theory and other things arguing,

138
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:39.820
which is that maybe we don't need to raise taxes for them. Now,

139
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:41.290
a lot of MMT years would say,

140
00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:44.380
you can't do things this big without raising taxes cause you get inflation.

141
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.870
So that's a, that's an argument as well. Um, but,

142
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:48.220
but that's my question for you. Like,

143
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.680
do we need to figure out how to pay for it because we have to figure out how to

144
00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:53.560
pay for it. Then it's going to be a, um,

145
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.320
it's going to force more choices and more sequencing.

146
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.730
<v 1>I agree with everything you just said as well. And I also, I've seen the math.</v>

147
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.950
I know the price tags on some of the things we're talking about,

148
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.140
but one of the things I said to folks on the trail was what is the

149
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.170
cost of not addressing climate change?

150
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.860
Or what would the costs of climate change be if we just let it wreak havoc and

151
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.190
ravage our country. And then people reflect on that for a second.

152
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.150
Most of them don't know the size of the economy pre pandemic was 22 trillion or

153
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:27.640
so. So if I throw that in there, then they say, well,

154
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.030
climate change is going to cost us trillions of dollars and thousands of human

155
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:34.810
lives if we were to do nothing. And so then you start thinking, okay,

156
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:37.480
the cost of inaction is in the trillions.

157
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.730
So then what is the benefit of our investing

158
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.140
in climate change mitigation,

159
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.940
particularly if you start measuring how we're doing based upon how we are

160
00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:53.020
actually doing as human beings, like if you have a group of people drinking,

161
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.330
unclean water, or, uh, having their town submerged, uh, you know,

162
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:01.680
that that might not show up in certain economic indicators, uh, but it ought to.

163
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.210
So the way I'd answer your question is to say that, uh,

164
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.270
we should not be thinking we can just do everything under the sun, uh,

165
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.620
in terms of putting it on the government's bottom line,

166
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.090
but we can be much,

167
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:19.620
much more aggressive than we currently are about making large scale investments

168
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.280
in our own future, in our infrastructure,

169
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.260
addressing climate change and putting universal basic income into our hands.

170
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.060
Because in many cases,

171
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:34.980
a lot of these investments will end up paying us back in both human ways

172
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:37.500
and economic ways. Uh, and the,

173
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:41.700
the argument I make on the trail was that if you have universal basic income and

174
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.030
people's hands, does that improve our educational outcomes?

175
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.770
Does that improve our health outcomes?

176
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.400
Does that reduce the costs of incarceration?

177
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.570
Does that improve the ability of ex-convicts, uh,

178
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.290
their ability to reintegrate into society? Like there are many,

179
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:02.790
many things that we spend a ton of money on right now that we could

180
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.440
reallocate or alleviate if we invested directly in our people.

181
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.390
And that was what a lot of people were missing.

182
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:13.320
Oftentimes is that the investments you and I are describing actually pay off and

183
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.730
in many cases pay for themselves.

184
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.430
