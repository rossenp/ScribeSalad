1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>Your book is phenomenal. I enjoyed it immensely. I've been a fan of SNL,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.450
uh, since I can remember. So let's start with a title, a very punchable face.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.550
Uh, you know, I think most people like find that funny, uh,

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.480
and there's like a theme of self-deprecation throughout the book. Um,

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.170
so what were the, what was the process behind your deciding on a title?

6
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:25.350
Because I know the title of your first book is actually kind of a big decision.

7
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.580
<v 1>It is, it's like with music, you put out an album, you,</v>

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.070
the first one can just be your name, you know, it's easy. No, you know,

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.180
that's just like the industry standard, you got an eponymous album, but that's,

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.230
you know, with books, you got to actually think about it, you know? Um, I wanna,

11
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.070
I also, before I start wanting to thank you, um, I was,

12
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.210
I'm very honored that you,

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.290
that you agreed to do this and talk to me and I'm a big fan of yours.

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.240
And I think what you brought to the campaign was such an elevated

15
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.060
and fresh set of ideas,

16
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.720
and you were just really fun to watch.

17
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.690
And also you, you, you like,

18
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.670
it was the only new ideas that were out there. And I really, uh, I,

19
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.150
I don't know, I gained like a whole new, uh,

20
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.450
like idea of what a candidate could be from watching you.

21
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.130
And I hope that your ideas continue and that you continue and,

22
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.730
and make them a reality cause it was really inspiring to see. So thank you.

23
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.860
And thank you for doing this cause it means a lot. Um, I, uh, I,

24
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.110
I, I wrote about a lot of,

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.710
so there's a lot of self-deprecating and humiliating things in my book.

26
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:40.670
I really wanted it always my book to be entertaining. Um,

27
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.680
I didn't want it to be, uh,

28
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.370
trying to be overly educational or pedantic in any way,

29
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.320
or I didn't want it to be, um,

30
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.610
just taking weird victory laps about anything or, or just like name,

31
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:57.380
dropping stuff. I wanted it to be stories that I thought were, were,

32
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.080
you know, that were funny and that people would, would like reading and,

33
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:05.930
and I ran everything through that filter and it turns out a lot of those stories

34
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.410
ended up being ones where I was injured, um,

35
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.970
or humiliated or emotionally abused or,

36
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.490
um, uh, you know, just by my own dumb decisions, uh,

37
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.200
got injured or put in a terrible position. And I thought, you know,

38
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.070
that would be entertaining. And it seems like people do enjoy when I, when,

39
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.420
when, uh, you know, injurious things happened to me.

40
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.530
<v 0>I, I confess that after reading your book,</v>

41
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.490
like you did start to resemble one of those action movie heroes in my mind where

42
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:43.820
like you take your shirt off and then there's like this scarf of that.

43
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.880
This is from like the Google mishap. This is from the bike.

44
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.140
This is from the surfing.

45
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.420
So you started to resemble that kind of figure in my

46
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:54.680
mind. Uh.

47
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.903
<v 1>Wow.</v>

48
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.390
<v 0>You're also, as, as we all know, you're engaged to, uh,</v>

49
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.480
like a superhero that, you know, everyone's growing, growing up with.

50
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.510
So there's that too. That's another reason why you seem like an action hero.

51
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.850
<v 1>No real superhero, but also that's not she's, it is a movie.</v>

52
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.890
<v 0>So I confessed to being, and this is one thing I liked about your book too,</v>

53
00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:19.980
is that like your, you know, your book was very, very personal. Um,

54
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.680
but like you said, it wasn't like a name-dropping type book.

55
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:24.330
It was like personal about your childhood,

56
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.830
personal about your formative experiences, which were very funny,

57
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:31.260
like consistently. Um, I, you know,

58
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:35.010
I feel like I understand Staten Island better, thanks to your book.

59
00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:38.910
And also I happened to have seen, um, King of Staten Island, uh, you know,

60
00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:43.620
relatively recently. And so like between that and your book, like,

61
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:46.830
I feel like I understand the fifth borough, uh,

62
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.540
hopefully it's not an insult be called with it, bro.

63
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.800
<v 1>And that's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said about that Island.</v>

64
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.930
<v 0>Staten Island. We're part of New York. It's real,</v>

65
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.000
we swear. Uh, and,

66
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.390
and so you went from Staten Island, you went to high school in the city,

67
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:10.170
which also had many, many funny, um, anecdotes, certainly the most effecting,

68
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.240
very, very quintessentially New York story,

69
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:17.160
I thought was the story of your mom and her bravery, uh, during nine 11. Uh,

70
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.510
and I was in New York, um, on that day,

71
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.990
like I remember when the towers fell was a beautiful day in terms of the

72
00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.820
weather, like, you know, not a cloud in the sky.

73
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:29.940
And then you hear that a plane crash in the world trade center. Uh,

74
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.680
and I was part of the crowd of thousands that just started

75
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:39.360
walking away from downtown. Like I was near the empire state building. Uh,

76
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:42.420
I showed up to work and then this happens and then everyone in the office is

77
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.870
like, we should get the heck outta here. Um, and then we start walking North.

78
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.370
Um, but your mom did the opposite. Your mom actually headed towards the towers,

79
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:54.810
which to me is probably the most heroic thing I can imagine doing,

80
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:56.370
having been on the Island that day.

81
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.290
Like every human instinct is like go away from, uh, uh,

82
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.020
from what is happening. And she actually went, went towards it.

83
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.180
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, um, it's, I don't,</v>

84
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.830
I don't know how that, that instincts happens. I think she, she,

85
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.710
you probably don't know until that moment happens,

86
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:17.820
how you're going to handle it.

87
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.040
And I think it probably for her came from knowing that all her,

88
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.970
you know, all the firefighters that she knew and worked with and,

89
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.150
and loved were all in there were, were,

90
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.030
were closer or near the buildings. And,

91
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:37.220
and I think she genuinely wanted to help them, um, and,

92
00:05:37.221 --> 00:05:41.040
and help get them out of that situation or help treat them. Um, you know,

93
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:42.210
I don't think she,

94
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.350
I don't think she ever imagined that the,

95
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.490
that the buildings would both fall, you know, I think that she didn't, you know,

96
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:54.570
she knew they had been hit and she kind of gradually figured out once,

97
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:57.410
depending on and been hit that it was a,

98
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.380
that there was a clearly a coordinated terrorist act,

99
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:04.580
but I don't think she ever thought structurally something like that would

100
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:09.260
happen. I mean, it was so crazy to start seeing happening because you don't,

101
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.010
even when things get hit, you know, you just don't expect that to happen.

102
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:16.820
So maybe she, uh, you know, I don't know that she ever thought that,

103
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:19.770
that I don't think she could imagine that that would have happened. Yeah.

104
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.010
<v 0>Well, that chapter certainly humanized you and your family, uh,</v>

105
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.570
in an incredible way because frankly, people look at you and think, Oh,

106
00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:31.870
I sit now famous celebrity engaged to a celebrity. And then when you,

107
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.920
when you read about your mom rushing towards the towers, uh,

108
00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:40.630
the fact that her life was saved twice by firemen who were right there with

109
00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:45.550
her, that the people she was with, um, lost their lives, uh, that, that day.

110
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.110
And then you imagine, uh, you know, you, and obviously like, you know,

111
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.920
people associate this with, uh, with your cast mates, Pete Davidson as well.

112
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.150
Like you realize that like the human condition, uh,

113
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.500
like it's, uh, it's your family,

114
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:07.150
it's Pete's family, it's the 343 families that got, um, uh,

115
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.240
that got devastated that day, who were families of firefighters.

116
00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:13.210
And it seems like your family has so,

117
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.470
so much of like the firefighter DNA, uh, like in your,

118
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.480
uh, like your family's history. Like, I, I felt like I got to know you better,

119
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.210
uh, as a result of sharing in that experience.

120
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.560
<v 1>It was, you know, it's such a, it's the community I knew the most, and it was,</v>

121
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:32.170
you know, like my, you know, my grandfather was a fireman.

122
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:37.090
My great grandfather was a fireman, all my cousins and, um, my uncles,

123
00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:39.010
everyone who lives on my block,

124
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:41.560
where my whole family lives mostly on Staten Island,

125
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.880
we're all in the fire department.

126
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:47.710
So I knew it forever as this really fun community of, of all these,

127
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.820
like, I feel like firefighters are some of the funniest people and, and really,

128
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.590
uh, a loving group of people. And then after that, there was a whole other,

129
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.090
you know, obviously element to it and you, and it was even more of a community,

130
00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:05.410
but in a whole different kind of way. Um, and I thought that one of the most,

131
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.900
uh, the things that my mom said that was the craziest to me was, you know,

132
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:13.390
when I went, I went, I remember going to visit, uh,

133
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.650
the head fire department headquarters where they have, they keep wa uh, uh,

134
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.540
basically a wall of the names of all the firefighters who died in the line of

135
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:23.320
duty.

136
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.850
And she said that in the first hundred years of the department,

137
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.620
they filled one wall. And then that day on September 11th,

138
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:36.400
they filled an entire other wall. Like that was, that was what the,

139
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.500
the sheer numbers for the department were. And, and, and, and Staten Island,

140
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:42.334
obviously,

141
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:47.350
including Pete's dad was part of that wall and a substantial part of that

142
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:50.670
wall on Staten Island. So, um, you know, I, I'm,

143
00:08:50.671 --> 00:08:55.230
I'm very proud of my mom and that's why I wanted to write that chapter. And, uh,

144
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.010
I really feel.

145
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.760
<v 0>For her of, of going through that and losing colleagues like that,</v>

146
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.460
you know, people, I was surprised by so much of your background because,

147
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.630
you know, I think they'll have very high level view is, um, you went,

148
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.620
went to Harvard, uh, that's one thing, and you had like a really fun, uh,

149
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.820
set of stories about Harvard. Uh, and so you don't think, Oh, you know,

150
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.630
like the mother works for the fire department, uh, you know,

151
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:26.490
grandfather was a fireman, uh, you think like, Oh, he went to Harvard. So,

152
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:26.761
you know,

153
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:31.740
maybe his parents were like orthodontists or whatever his

154
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:33.930
parents were president and vice-president of Harvard

155
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.120
or something or something. Right. Like the wiggle bot.

156
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.410
And then when you went to Harvard too,

157
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.620
like you framed it in such human terms where like, there's like this Haba,

158
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.970
like mystique, and then like you unpacked it, um, in such a humble way.
