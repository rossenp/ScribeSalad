WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>So two of the things that you pointed out as a programming choices, one,</v>

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.040
was that anything with Donald Trump or response to Donald Trump rated better?

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.290
And so, uh, you,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.640
or D just every about every cable news outlet covered everything Trump did,

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.660
um, during his 2016 run. And then that became true,

6
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:20.610
obviously when he was president. Um,

7
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:24.480
and then the inverse of that was that if there was something kind of educational

8
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:25.860
or scientific, uh,

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.780
or deeper than it would be less appealing or wouldn't rate

10
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:35.190
as well. And so you wound up wound up with like a bias towards, uh,

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.730
Trump all the time and less about, for example,

12
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.430
what a public health official or scientist was saying.

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.970
<v 1>Mm yeah. Yeah. Um,</v>

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.320
and initially when the pandemic started,

15
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.210
they are professional journalists and they kicked into gear just like they

16
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:58.040
should. And they were trying to get the information they could from

17
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:02.180
scientists and doctors and frontline workers, and,

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.840
um, developed a special, um,

19
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.700
Dr. Zika manual was, you know, on once a week, um, to,

20
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.120
to cover, you know, focus on issues related to COVID.

21
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.200
And after a number of weeks, they discovered that that wasn't writing well.

22
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:20.930
So then it got kind of, you know, started on Monday, Tuesday,

23
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:22.550
and then they pushed it to a Friday.

24
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.060
Cause that's the day that they don't care as much about ratings because that's

25
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.700
for our own programming for MSNBC's or less words,

26
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.000
programming needs, that, that it wasn't as important.

27
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.930
And then it slowly just kind of fizzled out and died. Um,

28
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.800
and it was because it wasn't writing well. And,

29
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.660
and then you could see the coverage when they were,

30
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.190
would do a COVID segment. It really was about just the politics.

31
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.380
Um, and they would have on science reporters or correspondents,

32
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.680
but they were, you know, pushing them,

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.740
trying to get them to talk more about the politics and the actual science.

34
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.500
And it was through a time when there were a lot there. I mean,

35
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.780
there's still lots of information coming out all the time about the,

36
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.580
about the virus and vaccines and what we know and what we don't know,

37
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.480
and that all of that was, you know,

38
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.690
they would try to get to it if they could, or it just,

39
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:23.660
wasn't kind of the top line. It was something that was thrown in maybe as a,

40
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:25.700
you know, an afterthought, um,

41
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.870
that all of that information really got pushed to the wayside and they focused

42
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.890
much more on the politics. And it was, you know, the, uh,

43
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.900
Trump attacking the blue state governors, or, you know, what Trump,

44
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.980
you know, what dumb thing Trump said or didn't say, or didn't do. Um,

45
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.600
it really focused on that.

46
00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.850
And I understand that there's a time and a place for that,

47
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:48.710
but it was just dominated everything.

48
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.810
<v 0>That drove me crazy on the trail to where it was always like</v>

49
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.820
Trump's stupid or inflammatory comment of the day. And then even like,

50
00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:01.900
I'd running for president and I were in New Hampshire and they'd be like,

51
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:03.610
Trump said this, what do you think of that? And I'm just like,

52
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.610
are you kidding me? Like really? Yeah.

53
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.870
<v 1>And yeah, yeah. W it, that, um,</v>

54
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.040
that same idea was pervasive throughout the, you know,

55
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.630
it was last election cycle as well. Um, the democratic primary process,

56
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.051
you know,

57
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:23.190
if there was a personality dispute that got way more attention than any

58
00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:25.350
interesting policy conversation.

59
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.530
And I think there were lots of interesting policy conversations we could have

60
00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:33.390
had, you know, um, the ideas that you had being the start of it.

61
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.270
Um, uh, but then, you know,

62
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:40.380
when it came down to the general and it was Biden versus Trump and, you know,

63
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:44.820
every, almost every single I know that they tried to, to,

64
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:47.280
to focus on Biden, um, when they could,

65
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:50.460
but it always turned into a segment about Trump. You know,

66
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:53.250
they don't want to talk about anything that is negative towards Democrats,

67
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.900
cause that was bad for the MSNBC audience and the same thing, you know,

68
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.290
applied to the democratic primaries as well. He don't, there just,

69
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:06.090
wasn't a full discussion that ultimately benefits everyone. So.

70
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.860
<v 0>I might have been part of that or a non part of that.</v>

71
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.000
<v 1>Yeah. I know. I know. I,</v>

72
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.300
this is not exactly an unbiased audience I'm talking to right now.

73
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.280
<v 0>Yeah, no, no. I mean, again, like this, this to me is more of like a systemic,</v>

74
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.070
um, uh, fraud problem.

75
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.440
<v 1>And, and it, uh, yeah, I saw it happen. I've watched it in 2016. And so that,</v>

76
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.320
you know, when everybody was, I'm sorry, um,

77
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.620
everyone was shocked that Hillary didn't do better than she did. I,

78
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.830
I was frustrated cause I was like, no, there were,

79
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.100
there were pulling numbers out that showed, you know, enthusiasm for her,

80
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.360
you know, that were concerning. And you know,

81
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.180
that MSNBC wasn't covering that.

82
00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:54.430
So that liberal audience didn't necessarily, you know.

83
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.490
<v 0>Well, that's rough, you know,</v>

84
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.300
like that there were actually some numbers that cut the other way that weren't

85
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:03.840
covered. I mean, that's, that's actually new to me relatively speaking.

86
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.070
Maybe everyone knows that already.

87
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.230
<v 1>I was angry almost every day in those meetings through,</v>

88
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.350
and it, it did,

89
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.540
it was not pleasant because I, I was at a point where I, I,

90
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.600
I, I mean, I never really bite my tongue anyway, but I,

91
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.770
I just could not believe that they were making decisions about, you know,

92
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.770
economic policy segments and, Oh, that's not going to,

93
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.080
you might not the day that I gave my resignation,

94
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:35.130
they canceled an economic segment because quota wasn't going to rate and they

95
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:38.430
filled it with some other like, um, you know,

96
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.020
not a serious segment. And, um,

97
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.900
I, you know,

98
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:50.670
between the pandemic and I Al I frankly had issues with how they were

99
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:54.930
covering the George Floyd stuff. Um, the, the protests,

100
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.370
uh, again, you know,

101
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.810
the way that they covered the protest, they,

102
00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:06.740
they wanted conflict and they put the correspondence on

103
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.310
the ground in a way that they, they, even if nothing was happening,

104
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:12.380
they wanted it to seem like something was happening.

105
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.470
And if there was a car that was on fire,

106
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:19.610
they're going to play that video over and over again. Meanwhile,

107
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.150
95% of the protests were peaceful,

108
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.490
but I've been in the control room going back to 2015 and the black lives

109
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.700
matters protest, then people, um,

110
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.840
they would monitor all of those protests, they'd have cameras and choppers,

111
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.100
you know, they are monitoring the protest and in less,

112
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:43.450
it turned violent. They would not quote, take it live. You know, they,

113
00:06:43.451 --> 00:06:47.720
they wouldn't show that peaceful protest because nothing was happening according

114
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:50.810
to them, you know, it was, it was boring and it wouldn't make good TV.

115
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.570
So that, um,

116
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.100
that is a type of thing that kind of got to me, um,

117
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.330
through the George Floyd, um, coverage, uh, there were,

118
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.310
there were other elements, there were, there were, um, points about the,

119
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.550
uh, election and election security.

120
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.020
Those stories kept getting sidelined. They were not covering them. They'd,

121
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.850
you know, I was trying to get them to cover the issues, you know, how,

122
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.940
how are you going to have a safe election, you know, with COVID and, you know,

123
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:27.890
there were lots of groups working on it and they, um, uh, it was really, really,

124
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:32.090
really difficult to get them to cover that. Um, uh,

125
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.090
there was, uh,

126
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.940
there were opportunities, um, when Trump went to Tulsa there opportunities to,

127
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.170
to talk about some of the kind of painful history in this country.

128
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.180
Um, it was, would have been very easy to discuss, um,

129
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.440
the history and Tulsa and the Tulsa riots or Juneteenth,

130
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.200
and what is all behind, you know,

131
00:07:57.201 --> 00:08:00.080
what is behind that and why it's so meaningful to the African-American

132
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:00.890
community.

133
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.820
And you can trace the anger from those events to George Floyd. It,

134
00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:09.230
it would have been, it wouldn't have taken very long at all, but there were,

135
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.070
there was, there was, um, a history there that I didn't know,

136
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.970
and I know a lot of smart people and journalists didn't know,

137
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.810
and it was a perfect opportunity to, to share that.

138
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:24.950
And it helps the nation understand, you know,

139
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:27.620
what is happening other than just, you know,

140
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.530
people are angry and looting the local Walmarts.

141
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.050
<v 0>One thing that a producer friend of yours said that really, um, seemed telling,</v>

142
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:38.500
was, look, people come to us for comfort. Like they don't see us as the news.

143
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.930
Uh, I thought that was incredible. And there is something fundamental about, uh,

144
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.650
two different purposes. One would be, I'm going to Edify and inform.

145
00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:51.850
And so I'm going to serve you some stuff that might be not that scintillating.

146
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:54.280
It might be kind of boring. It's like broccoli as programming.

147
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.930
And then this other direction that it's like, I'm entertainment.

148
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.910
Like I'm going to have a certain patter and rhythm and

149
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:04.860
characters and something that you can cheer.

150
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.820
<v 1>Right? Yeah. And that was in one of our, uh, uh,</v>

151
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.280
planning meetings. So that was a senior producer. And, um,

152
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.130
it's definitely something that, you know,

153
00:09:16.131 --> 00:09:20.330
stood out and something I remembered because you're abdicating your role as a

154
00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:21.170
journalist. And that's,

155
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.800
it's confusing because otherwise it kind of looks like a newscast. You know,

156
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:28.160
you have an anchor sitting at a desk with, you know, you know,

157
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.110
the TV over his shoulder and you're covering things that are in the news.

158
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.790
And so the audience, uh, you know, I realized that, you know, they, there's,

159
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.630
there's an awareness and MSNBC is, um, uh,

160
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.100
more opinionated than the straight, you know, 6:00 PM newscast.

161
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.850
But at the same time, they're, they,

162
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.530
they play it both ways.

163
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.570

166
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.394

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.280
