00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.481
<v 0>Albert,</v>

2
00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:04.050
one thing you said to me early on in the campaign is actually pre-campaign. Um,

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.340
but you said something like the Swiss had to run a referendum on women's right.

4
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.520
To vote 16 times before it passed or something along those lines.

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.460
And you're you, and you made that comparison because you were like,

6
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:18.180
we should start running out of UBI now with the thought that it might take more

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:23.160
than one try. Uh, and I remember hearing this and I just loved the, um,

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.400
the long-term thinking you had where it wasn't like, Hey,

9
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.670
it's Andrew Yang going to be in the white house. It was more like, Hey, let's,

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.320
let's get the first run it because it might take multiple tries.

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.220
<v 1>Yeah. It, it might be worth zooming out for a moment. Um,</v>

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.680
you know, the, the, the UBI isn't a panacea, um,

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.790
it is one ingredient in a larger transition.

14
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.650
And what is that larger transition?

15
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.200
It's the transition out of the industrial age?

16
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.030
So the biggest mistake that politicians, um,

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.200
in many countries, not just the U S have been making for probably the last 10,

18
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:07.850
maybe the last 20 years is to treat digital technology and

19
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:12.350
computers as if it was just an extension of the industrial age. Um,

20
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.540
this transition that we're going through is as profound as when we went from

21
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:21.110
being fortress to occurrence society and then from a grand society to industrial

22
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:21.944
society.

23
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.360
And so those transitions took long periods of time.

24
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.850
Um, and they were multi-generational projects and they require it the wholesale

25
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.260
reinvention of how people live. Uh, and so, um,

26
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.470
UBI is super important. It's a cornerstone,

27
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:43.040
but it's not the only thing that we need to think about when we talk about how

28
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:47.810
we get past the industrial age. Uh, and so, um,

29
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.630
it's crucial to have a larger vision, uh, and you know,

30
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090
part of the, um,

31
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.710
how we wind up with certain sort of regressive political movements at the

32
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:02.360
moment in many, um,

33
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.340
democracies is because we've left this vacuum where for a decade

34
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.730
or more, we've been saying, look, a little tweak of the interest rate here,

35
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.830
and a little bit of free training over there,

36
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:17.090
and everything will be good and where most people sit, that's just not true.

37
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:20.690
Most people saying that you keep saying that, but it's just not working. Right.

38
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.580
And so we, we, we need to paint a broader picture of a future.

39
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.000
Uh, and Susan mentioned the spark of Hudson earlier.

40
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:32.030
That is also part of that broader picture, which is,

41
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.860
who has access to knowledge? How do you bring knowledge to everybody,

42
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.730
including people who've been excluded from it for a long period of time?

43
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.210
<v 2>Yeah. So that's why we're working on the workforce development program.</v>

44
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.620
We're working on trying to get the infrastructure and Hudson, um,

45
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.390
up to speed and transportation so that people can actually get to the work, um,

46
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.850
that, that there may exist. So all the different parts.

47
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.000
<v 1>And, and, and also the, the connectivity infrastructure.</v>

48
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.880
So people have high-speed access, um, and fundamentally changing,

49
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.150
you know, where and how you can learn, right? So, um,

50
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.770
we have set up a system where the presumption is that you need to go to school

51
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:12.760
in order to learn.

52
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.510
And then ideally you go from school to some like fancy college.

53
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.780
And if you don't do that, you somehow, like not smart,

54
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:24.580
not worthy, can't learn things. And we believe that,

55
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.060
um, that's just not true that, um, people can learn things.

56
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.780
They can learn them at different ages in different ways. And that, you know,

57
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:35.890
a big thrust of digital technology is to let people learn things at any point.

58
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.590
Um, you know, including much later in life.

59
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.780
<v 0>Now, more than ever, not your kids, again are a bit older,</v>

60
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:46.050
but I was in parts of the country where they don't have high speed internet.

61
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.030
And you can imagine those kids now trying to learn. I mean,

62
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.940
there are so many kids that right now are struggling,

63
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.470
uh, academically because of the fact that now, I mean,

64
00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.350
they've lost months and we're looking at this fall,

65
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.560
it's unclear what school's going to look like.

66
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:09.090
But certainly having broadband access to me is like a cornerstone,

67
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:10.020
a building block. It's like,

68
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:14.820
how can you make meaningful educational opportunities available if someone like

69
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.410
they're not even going to be able to plug in, uh, uh, in a real way.

70
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.050
So one thing that you all have been very passionate about,

71
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:24.690
which I think most everyone listening to this is going to agree with is that,

72
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.240
so you have one, cornerstone is universal, basic income,

73
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:30.630
and then climate change is something else that you've been very passionate about

74
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:32.370
and working on. And so, Susan,

75
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:34.980
I'd love to ask you something that I just saw an article,

76
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:39.180
and it made me almost jumped for joy where someone who's an environmental

77
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.770
activists said, Hey, universal,

78
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:43.920
basic income might really be part of the solution, um,

79
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.100
lighting up our environmental footprint. Uh,

80
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:50.430
so can you talk about the work you all have been doing on climate change and how

81
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:54.690
you see some of these income policies impacting our ability to make

82
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:57.390
progress on a sustainable economy?

83
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.040
<v 1>The relation to UBI is a really interesting one. Um, first, uh,</v>

84
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.420
as we talked about previously,

85
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.400
we'll let more people be politically active and get to solutions, um,

86
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.840
for the climate crisis. But the second thing is there's also some evidence, um,

87
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.790
early evidence that UBI changes people's view of consumption.

88
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.090
Um, and the way it does that is that when you are no longer in the

89
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.930
scarcity mindset that, um, Oh my God, I can't afford anything.

90
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.670
Our consumption actually starts to loom less large and people's, um,

91
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.810
needs and, and all of a sudden people go, Oh,

92
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.180
maybe I should learn something instead.

93
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:43.830
Or maybe I should put some money aside, or maybe I should, um,

94
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.090
become engaged in something. So, um, there's a lot of evidence that, um,

95
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.470
this sort of scarcity mindset that is forced upon a lot of people makes it very

96
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:57.150
difficult to think beyond consumption and so much of,

97
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.360
um, uh, what we're applying ourselves to unfortunately is just, you know,

98
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.600
consumption and it's just making enough money to keep consuming.

99
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.860
And so districts.

100
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.570
<v 2>And to pay the bills, put food on the table, right? Yeah.</v>

101
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.290
<v 1>So disrupting that is a, is a crucial aspect. I made this.</v>

102
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.850
<v 0>Same argument on the trail.</v>

103
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.980
One of my hopes was that if you have the boot off of people's

104
00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:24.760
throats, where you had enough money, where you could meet your basic needs,

105
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.770
I thought we'd have much more in the way of arts and creativity and folks going

106
00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:33.190
to the woods and working on a novel and whatnot,

107
00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:37.000
and adopting more minimalist type lifestyles,

108
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.320
because they would have different goals for themselves in different pursuits

109
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.150
instead of driving and commuting to their cubicle and doing job X,

110
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:48.790
like you'd have more people doing things that were more organic.

111
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.130
<v 2>Now and that with COVID right,</v>

112
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:54.760
a lot of people are now moving to the country and we're seeing that they're not

113
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:58.630
consuming as much as they were that they're going out in nature that they're

114
00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:02.260
enjoying it. That they're, that they're doing activities that as Albert said,

115
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.790
is, are not consumptive.

116
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.520
<v 1>And there's a basic income project in Germany that Susan,</v>

117
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:08.140
that I've been supporting for years,

118
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:12.790
that has a lot of evidence to that same effect where people, um, really,

119
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.800
um, suddenly decrease the consumption. This is sometimes a, uh,

120
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.660
an objection that people bring up to UBI.

121
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.640
They say people just going to spend it on more stuff,

122
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.070
but actually the evidence goes the opposite direction.

123
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.010
<v 0>That makes me so glad because I was making that argument on the trail probably</v>

124
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:33.960
best. I wasn't citing like some German data. Oh,

125
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.030
that's American said to like their data homegrown. But, uh, like the,

126
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:39.790
the thing I was suggesting was like, look,

127
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:44.170
if you can actually get the boot off of people's throats,

128
00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:48.250
they're going to be much more energized around making different types of choices

129
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.200
and also be more, uh, attentive to climate change. Because right now,

130
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.980
if you were laboring under this constant scarcity mindset, and someone says,

131
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.460
you need to worry about climate change. And you're like,

132
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.930
I'm worried about next month rent. You know, it's like, like, like,

133
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.470
like the earth or this big grand problem, that's a years away.

134
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.260
And then the human impulse is to say as a diabetic,

135
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.790
it's not that big a deal anyway,

136
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:16.420
like this is like the sort of a defensive response.

137
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.950
<v 2>Well, and also, um,</v>

138
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.430
the thing that we're working on here at the farm is we're trying to change the

139
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:25.630
mindset of how people view the climate crisis that, you know,

140
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:29.380
it could really be. Um, when you, when you work to be sustainable,

141
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.820
it can really be something quite joyous where it's all around sort of enjoying

142
00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:35.110
nature. And.

143
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.660
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, it's, it's the idea that, um,</v>

144
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.700
we have the means to overcome this crisis without somehow all, you know,

145
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.270
going back and sort of living in a hovel, right.

146
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.130
<v 2>And being dour about it. We're having fun while we're doing it.</v>
