WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>RBG, uh, passing. That was a real loss.</v>

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:06.990
And I re I can't, I mean,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.990
I w you're a good person to ask because they're like,

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:12.540
they're going to bring the vote up, but then Republican Senator,

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.420
two of them say, they're not going to do it. I don't know.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.250
I am not educated enough on the system for

7
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:24.150
right now, before it's just 50 days before an election,

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.440
whether that could actually, it could, it actually happen.

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.150
Do they actually approve someone?

10
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.160
<v 1>They also do have until the new president is sworn in technically.</v>

11
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:35.840
So there's something called the lame duck session,

12
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.150
which is between November 3rd of this year.

13
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.860
And let's call it January 20th of next year. So it's another, um, you know,

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.140
a couple of months and change. Um, so the,

15
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:51.860
the rules are that they need a majority vote to confirm a new justice.

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.620
Uh, right now they have 53 Republican senators. And like you said to said,

17
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.190
they don't want to do it. So now you, you, you have,

18
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.110
if you have one more person,

19
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:07.460
let's call him Mitt Romney who decides not to then you'd be at 50 50,

20
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:11.450
but technically the vice president can give a tie-breaking vote in the Senate.

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.580
So you need two more Republican senators to join

22
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.140
the, this is not a good idea given this late stage, uh, caucus,

23
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.220
if you will. Uh,

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.070
and we're all waiting to see whether there are two more senators that,

25
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.740
that had in that direction. Uh,

26
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.180
there's nothing technically stopping them from trying to do this before the end

27
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:33.890
of the year. For me,

28
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.120
it's crazy that we're dealing with, uh,

29
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.660
the repercussions that are so predictable of, uh,

30
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.720
like of just this antiquated way of administering the Supreme court.

31
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.800
Like the fact that, and I used to say this on the trail, Joel, I was like, like,

32
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:53.330
does it make sense that we are all literally just waiting on tenterhooks based

33
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:57.590
upon the health of an 87 year old woman, uh, and you know,

34
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:59.060
and then she passes,

35
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:02.450
which I hate to say it was like somewhat predictable given that, you know,

36
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.420
she'd been struggling with cancer for years and years. Yeah. That,

37
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.260
that we needed to have in my mind,

38
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:13.670
like a much more modern approach to the Supreme court for a long time. Uh,

39
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.850
and I, I re I proposed 18 year term limits when I was running,

40
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:21.320
which would improve things dramatically because then, you know,

41
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:23.300
you get an appointment, the person's there for 18 years,

42
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:27.230
which is a plenty long time. And just about any context. Um,

43
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.250
but they're not going to be there until the day they die. You don't have, uh,

44
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.320
this political firestorm coming up out of nowhere when someone expires, uh,

45
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.520
the, the other big thing is you shouldn't have only nine justices. Uh, you know,

46
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:44.630
which is another reason why it's such a, uh, firestorm whenever someone passes,

47
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.150
because each vote is so pivotal, uh,

48
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.890
someone recommended 27 at which struck me as perfectly fine.

49
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:52.580
And well,

50
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.700
you just appoint a new one every two years until you get up to that level.

51
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.920
And then you have enough of a critical mass.

52
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.130
You also don't need all 70 hero case.

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.340
That's the other thing is that in district courts,

54
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.230
some subset of the judges will hear it.

55
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.860
And then if it's a major ruling that overturns a precedent,

56
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.030
then they can bring everyone in. Um, so that it's,

57
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.180
it's just painful to see our country struggling with something based upon a law

58
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.010
that was passed in 1869.

59
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.430
And there was an 1869 law that said nine justices,

60
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:24.840
but all you need them as is a majority vote to say, you know what,

61
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.430
stop telling me not anymore. Like, and, and then, uh,

62
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.650
you can change it cause there's nothing in the constitution about nine.

63
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:33.880
So now I'm all excited about the fact that we need to try and modernize our

64
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.530
government. That's one of my new jams,

65
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:40.090
Joel modernize the government and the Supreme court and the Supreme court has

66
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.630
the most archaic approach you can think of. It's like,

67
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.190
it really is like something out of a,

68
00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:49.600
a game of Thrones or some science fiction novel.

69
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:53.980
It's like we have these nine unelected folks that we appoint they're there until

70
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:55.030
the day they die.

71
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.360
And you're like checking their blood pressure and whatnot to see like, Oh,

72
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:03.010
are you going to be here for, for 30 or 40 years? So that like,

73
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.900
nothing could change during that time. The whole thing, uh, is just,

74
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.330
mind-blowingly add a date.

75
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.690
<v 0>I agree, you know, w and you've framed that perfectly because it is,</v>

76
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.330
you forget that when, like, what Scalia died,

77
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:23.190
it was just like this huge surprise. And, and then there's this huge,

78
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.840
you know, like, as you said,

79
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.910
it's like this gigantic reaction because they're appointed for

80
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:32.400
life. And yeah. If it was 18 years,

81
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:36.630
which is a good run at any job I would, you would know,

82
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.270
and it would be way easier. I mean,

83
00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:42.330
there's so many things it's so strange to think.

84
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.560
I learned it mostly from Hamilton, but, uh, I read the book too, but, uh,

85
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.760
you're like, Oh, they just put these things. Tons of it works really well,

86
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.620
but there's room for improvement to say the least.

87
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.360
<v 1>My Lord, that that's the unofficial motto of America. Now, unfortunately,</v>

88
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:01.200
when it comes to government,

89
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:06.060
Joel it's like America don't change anything like America fixed it

90
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.500
stowed. We had this rule and it was delivered to us on a tablet. Uh,

91
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.740
no it wasn't. I mean, these guys brilliant, brilliant, uh,

92
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.180
people put together a system, but the system needs to adapt and evolve.

93
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.960
Uh, and DC is not really built for evolution. That way,

94
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.830
that to me is something that should be nonpartisan or bipartisan. It's like,

95
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:27.960
look, let's just modernize.

96
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.790
And you can imagine a more modern approach to the Supreme court terms and, uh,

97
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.680
and appointments. Uh,

98
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.580
you can imagine a more modern approach to legislation and

99
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.770
voting for sure. I mean, the, the, the fact that we're,

100
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:47.670
we're dealing with some of the fears we're dealing with around voting, uh,

101
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.390
and I'm not someone like I understand the technology and understand that. Look,

102
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.950
if you just had, um, all of our voting done via smartphone first, there's a,

103
00:05:55.951 --> 00:06:00.050
there's a major party that likes to have people not vote,

104
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.440
which you know, so that that's one set of issues. Um,

105
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.800
but it is true that some of the technology, um,

106
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.710
would not be ready for prime time. Uh,

107
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.110
but you have to start moving in that direction.

108
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:14.900
And there could be a period when you have, uh,

109
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.380
you have more advanced voting via smartphone,

110
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.590
and then you have some paper redundancy for awhile or whatnot, you know,

111
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.690
and you can like use things as backup, uh,

112
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.590
like that there are different approaches you could take that it's not just all

113
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.760
in one direction. And Americans would love that stuff. If we were like,

114
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.000
if we were like, look, you're going to vote the old fashioned way. It's cool,

115
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.130
but we're going to do this pilot program of, of digital voting too.

116
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.350
And we're just going to like start stress,

117
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:45.530
testing it and see how it works and see how you like it and whatnot like that.

118
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:49.610
That would be awesome. I know that that would be an intelligent approach.

119
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.473
Instead,

120
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.310
a lot of it is political where a lot of folks like things the way they are

121
00:06:55.311 --> 00:07:00.110
for, um, really just for keeping things the same right now,

122
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:03.890
the congressional approval rating, uh, around the country is 21%,

123
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.430
which is very low. And it's about, um,

124
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.190
even with what it's been this last number of years has even been lower at times.

125
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:11.060
It's been like 17.

126
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.010
The reelection rate for members of Congress is 94%.

127
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.770
So think about that for a second. You're like, wait a minute.

128
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.590
None of us are happy with what's going on, but like everyone wins.

129
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.610
Let's come back and be like, well, if I want to keep my seat, I win.

130
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.460
And there are a bunch of structural reasons for that. I mean,

131
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.270
part of it's gerrymandering and the way the districts are set up,

132
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.270
part of it though, is just this massive fundraising advantage where, uh,

133
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.290
the average successful house candidate raised 1.6 million for Senate it's

134
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:41.840
10.4 million. And so it,

135
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:46.700
can you imagine a normal person trying to raise 1.6 million for a congressional

136
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:51.080
campaign to be impossible? It's like, you know, like, uh, like, I mean,

137
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.300
I was frankly something of an unknown, um, but I remember raising that first,

138
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.910
uh, set of money and it was brutal. Like,

139
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.060
don't want it to get my get money either. I was like, Hey,

140
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.910
you and I are a bit old friends for a long time. I'm running for president.

141
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.550
You want to donate 2,700 wide campaign. And that,

142
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:11.360
that stuff was really, really difficult.

143
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:15.860
So for anyone who is trying to do the right thing and, uh, you know,

144
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.560
run for Congress for their district, like,

145
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:23.540
unless you have been cultivating tons of relationships

146
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:25.460
with people that have had money over a period of time,

147
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:27.650
like you're not going to be able to raise enough money to be competitive.

148
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.581
And frankly,

149
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:30.950
if you were the sort of person that was cultivating those relationships for a

150
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:34.640
long time, you probably were not the person we're hoping rods.

151
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.790
Like those two things, I've got a mutually.

152
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.630
<v 0>No choice, but to cultivate those relationships,</v>

153
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.440
because I'm not going to raise the money if they don't. And it's so, you know,

154
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:49.390
like camp, the campaigning is endless, it starts. So, I mean, it's,

155
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.240
it makes, you know, like buying,

156
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:57.090
it's like buying Christmas gifts in July. And I like the, uh,

157
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.280
European model, I guess it's British for. They're like, okay,

158
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:04.110
you can start campaigning off this day. And then yes. And then it stops.

159
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.550
And, and,

160
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.080
but the system is so ingrained and it helps, you know,

161
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:14.550
it's helped a lot of people. And so they're not going to stop it.

162
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.200
<v 1>The never-ending campaign, man, I just saw this stat that said,</v>

163
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:23.060
I'm like Barack Obama in his last year in office, when he like, uh,

164
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.980
or one of the years he was running for reelection,

165
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:29.670
it might've been 2012 attended over 200 fundraisers that year. And,

166
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:30.321
and you're just like,

167
00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:35.180
how are you trying to run the country and to show up to 200

168
00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:35.811
fundraisers,

169
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:40.700
does anyone think that's like an optimal use of his or freaking Trump has

170
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:41.600
never stopped campaign?

171
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.450
<v 0>And when you think about the Senate and then you think about Congress and then</v>

172
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.110
obviously the state Congress, all of that, and they're all doing it.

173
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.630
And I just like, I don't know what if you were, would you want your doctor,

174
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.050
if your doctor had to raise their salary, you know,

175
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.060
like I want them to focus on medicine and making sure that I stay healthy

176
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:06.950
and are up-to-date with the latest information and not out doing this work

177
00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:09.650
to, you know, just maintain them themselves.

178
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.850
