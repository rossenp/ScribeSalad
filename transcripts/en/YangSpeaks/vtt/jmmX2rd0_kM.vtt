WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>Um, like, uh, I think that, that our economy, in my opinion,</v>

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.830
is becoming increasingly inhuman and punitive and like veering off to like a,

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.320
this right word direction. Uh,

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.830
and my big goal is to try and humanize it. Um,

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.610
and I feel like what you're doing with this human centered storytelling is

6
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:25.140
trying to drag us in this direction. Um, in a positive way,

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.350
I feel like the world needs much, much more of it. The world would use, like,

8
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:30.060
could you use like a Legion of Sheryl housers,

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:33.480
even though that's impossible because you're like this unique, um,

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.030
figure and unicorn. Um,

11
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.730
and one of my goals in having this conversation really,

12
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.370
it was for you to try and impart some of what makes you,

13
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:44.910
you want to like other folks who want to be you and I'm know,

14
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.820
there are many people listening to this or watching this who are thinking like,

15
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:51.350
wow, this woman's amazing. Um, so yeah, that, that,

16
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:55.230
that just wanted to lay out that that was like the, um,

17
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.210
the impossible goal I'd set for myself in this conversation.

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.760
Yeah. But Andrew was my profound gratitude for everything you've done in

19
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:06.594
who you are.

20
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.000
<v 1>Oh, well, I feel the same about you, Andrew. You know that, but in,</v>

21
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.470
and you know, you say the character chur of you is, you know, maybe that like,

22
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.850
you know, the math guy, but we all know that's not who you are. I mean,

23
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.900
why did you, you, you, you risked so much and you, you know,

24
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.930
you left your family for two years and you like went on, uh,

25
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.290
on this campaign trail because you, you had a calling,

26
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:35.000
you were driven because you were so empathetic to what you saw

27
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.930
happening in our country. So you, you engaged your big brain to see,

28
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.330
look at the data and see what was happening,

29
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.760
but then you engaged your big heart to say,

30
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.750
I see what's happening and I can't let it happen. I have to take action.

31
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.670
And in your taking action,

32
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.560
you stirred everyone else to follow you in solidarity to change

33
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.490
what's happening. And that's what I try to do with storytelling. Um,

34
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.110
the same thing to, to create action in solidary. But you know, you,

35
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.010
you ask in your book and your, your,

36
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.360
your slogan was humanity first and now your humanity forward. And in your book,

37
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.880
you ask what makes us human?

38
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.190
What makes us human is our ability to love, to feel, to care,

39
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:20.570
to have empathy, to feel empathy. And, you know, um,

40
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.410
in all of the, you know, there's this, this guy, um, Paul Zak,

41
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:29.000
who's done a ton of studies in the lab around storytelling and around the

42
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:33.230
oxytocin and the cortisol, but he, you know, one of his studies,

43
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:37.130
he would play a video of a father talking to the camera about his son,

44
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.530
who's two and dying of cancer. And, um, and, uh, it,

45
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:46.520
it follows that hero's journey of the fathers. I have to be strong for him.

46
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.160
And then at the end, and he, he's, uh,

47
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.950
taking people's oxytocin in the beginning, the end, you know,

48
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:55.010
cortisol that the end of that story, he asks,

49
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:58.880
do you want to donate some of the money you're being paid to be in this

50
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.300
to a charity that gives money to, um, uh, for, uh,

51
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.310
children with cancer and the higher levels of oxytocin that people

52
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:13.810
have in their blood, uh, indicated they would give more money. I mean, it's,

53
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.610
and then the people who did give money felt warm and fuzzy after giving the

54
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.220
money and the people who didn't didn't,

55
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.290
which we also know that when we give, we benefit so much,

56
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.000
so this is what, like,

57
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.350
I want to move people in telling stories to have the warm and fuzzy

58
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.790
feeling, and then, you know, and to be fired up to take action.

59
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.610
Um, and you say it all the time, you know,

60
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.180
and which is why you talk about like how dire things are,

61
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:47.290
but you also give everyone hope you have a vision of what society could be.

62
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.240
If we can tap into our humanity and tap into and get that

63
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:54.430
oxytocin, flowing, get the, you know,

64
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.410
more of the optimism and the love and the caring and empathy and all of

65
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:02.800
those things. So it, you know, it is,

66
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.420
it is a self love, begets, love, hope he gets hope.

67
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:11.200
And we know when people are hopeful and optimistic, what they're capable of,

68
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:13.840
they can start to take risk and, um,

69
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.400
see their potential and reach for their potential. If people have the mint,

70
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.810
uh, mentality of scarcity, as you talk about there,

71
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.490
all they can think about is like survival it's survival mode.

72
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.540
And then you can't think about caring for others and loving others and all those

73
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:33.190
other things. So, anyway, I mean,

74
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:37.690
there is a corollary between what you're trying to do in politics and what I try

75
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.120
to do with storytelling. Um,

76
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.830
then it all comes down to humanity and what makes us human and bringing out the

77
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:49.090
humanity in us, because that's when we are our best selves.

78
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.400
<v 0>Um, that makes me really proud that you think we're doing the same kind of work.</v>

79
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:57.990
Cheryl, let me see very happy. Um, you know, it is about dialing up humanity.

80
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.600
Um, I, I have a question for you then.

81
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.130
I don't know if we've ever discussed this really,

82
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.260
but when I told you I was running for president and I said, Hey,

83
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:06.720
when you make this campaign video, like, what did you really think?

84
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.220
<v 1>Um, I remember I'll never forget the moment.</v>

85
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:14.580
When you told me you were running for president, we were at, um,

86
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.750
an event screening at grand central tech. And, um,

87
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.880
like it was, you had just, uh, sold your book, uh,

88
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.150
the war on normal people. You hadn't started to write the war on normal people.

89
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.490
And, um, it, the people were, were watching the movie and whenever, uh,

90
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:35.130
we were at these events Greenies together, when people watch the movie,

91
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:38.640
it was a time for us to catch up, which was wonderful. And you said,

92
00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:42.150
I'm going to run for president. And you know what I said to you,

93
00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:44.820
what I have would say to my children,

94
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:47.490
when they told me they were going to do things that sounded kind of crazy.

95
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.650
I said, that's amazing. I said, Andrew, go for it. First of all,

96
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.600
because I knew you well by them.

97
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.600
And I saw how you had built venture for America fast. And I knew that you,

98
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:03.530
more than anyone I've ever met can, will things into being.

99
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:07.610
And this is also storytelling. The stories we tell ourselves,

100
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.530
either propel us or hold us back. So, you know,

101
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.390
um, we filmed with Cassandra who was born, a congenital amputee,

102
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:21.530
and her whole life told herself and other people told her,

103
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.880
you only have one arm. You cannot be a nurse. She wanted to be a nurse.

104
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.510
She was told you cannot be a nurse. You only have one arm.

105
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.220
And then when she got onto social media and, um,

106
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.670
saw that there were other people with one arm who were nurses,

107
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:42.230
if you can't see it, you can't be it. She realized, wow, I can be a nurse.

108
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:44.630
And when she told herself I can be a nurse,

109
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.190
she figured out how to make that happen. You are someone who tells yourself,

110
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.840
I am going to do this. I can do this. And then you make it happen.

111
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.430
You just will it into existence. And that is also the power of storytelling,

112
00:06:58.431 --> 00:06:59.990
the stories we tell ourselves.

113
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.060
And so when you said I'm going to run for president, I thought, okay,

114
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.380
it's crazy. But Andrew is, he's going to do it. I mean, I,

115
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.780
I didn't think you were going to be our candidate,

116
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:14.900
but I did think that you were gonna make a lot of noise and that you were going

117
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.840
to reach your goal of making universal,

118
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:21.980
basic income and automation and all the things. And, uh, you know,

119
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:25.910
looking at a different way to measure progress in our,

120
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.650
in our society, that you were going to make them part of the public

121
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.960
discourse, um, throughout the campaign and onwards. And so it,

122
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.381
you know,

123
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:40.220
you really have done that and you continue to do that through humanity forward,

124
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:44.690
which is, and yang speaks and everything you're doing. So, um, again,

125
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.560
what did I think, I thought this is so bold. This is so crazy.

126
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.760
If anyone can pull off success, whatever success is going to look like,

127
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:56.420
it's Andrew. If anyone has the guts to do this, it's Andrew.

128
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.080
And when you call, when I remember when you asked me to do the video,

129
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.800
you called, you got my voicemail and you left a message and you said, Hey,

130
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.060
Cheryl, it's Andrew calling. I have a favor to ask, can you call me back?

131
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.160
And I knew, it's like, okay, Andrew wants me to make his campaign. I know it.

132
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.300
I just knew it. And I thought I am honored.

133
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.240
I would be honored. That's what I thought. I, Andrew.

134
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.880
<v 0>Well, well, you definitely, uh, delivered, you know, you called back and said,</v>

135
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:28.780
yeah, let's do it, which I was endlessly grateful for because, uh,

136
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:30.370
you didn't have much to work with. And like,

137
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:34.600
we weren't paying top dollar or anything close to it. It was, it was just a,

138
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.060
yet another labor of love. Um,

139
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.750
and I hope you felt proud of everything that happened thereafter,

140
00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:43.810
because I genuinely think that, uh,

141
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:47.260
it might not have happened if not for your belief in friendships. So thank you.

142
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.430
<v 1>It would have happened,</v>

143
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.050
but I was honored to be part of that journey and to be part of helping,

144
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.600
you know, you, uh, you start the campaign. I mean,

145
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.910
yeah. Uh.

146
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.650
<v 0>So, um, so if anyone wants to see your work, uh, where should they go?</v>

147
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.370
<v 1>Uh, well, uh, they should go to creative breed.com and,</v>

148
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.330
um, I have to update it because, uh, some of my recent work isn't there, but,

149
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.740
um, and generation startup is generation startup.com.

150
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.900
And we were on Netflix for two years as you know, um, no longer,

151
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.630
but we're still on iTunes, Amazon, Google play YouTube,

152
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.270
voodoo hoopla to be, I mean, generation startup is widely available. Um,

153
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.620
and still moving people.

154
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.260
<v 0>You should. My, my cousin, um,</v>

155
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.270
sent me a picture of my face on the monitor of

156
00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:43.400
the airplane seat in front of her,

157
00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:47.450
because she was watching your movie on a plane being like, Hey, look,

158
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.740
look at this. So the movie generation startup is indeed everywhere,

159
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.750
and I'm sure it is, uh, moving people, um, all over the world still to this day.

160
00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.110
And I know, um, we're just getting started.

161
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.640
There are so many stories to tell and we do have to do everything we can to try

162
00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:06.590
and humanize, uh,

163
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.480
this land right now because it needs you more than ever. Um,

164
00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:14.090
so thank you for everything Cheryl and I,

165
00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:17.150
and thank you for helping make me more human.

166
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.180
I genuinely had your voice in my ear, the entire campaign.

167
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.730
Like I was like, yeah, sure. I would say show, it'd be like Andrew, you know,

168
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.180
you still have to try to, um, express your humanity.

169
00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:31.850
So you should know you had a big impact on me. Yeah.

170
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.490
<v 1>Thank you. I think he, I think it was the natural evolution, but I appreciate,</v>

171
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:41.120
I hear you and I, and I appreciate the things, but, um,

172
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:46.130
you know, watching you for me, that was so what I was most proud of,

173
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:51.020
I mean, just to see you grow and evolve, um, you know,

174
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.210
you were always incredibly human,

175
00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:56.960
so it wasn't like you weren't human and you became human. It's just,

176
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.240
you allowed yourself to express that more and more and more, you know, as you,

177
00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:05.540
and now, you know, I think you're, you, like,

178
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:09.980
you just are so comfortable in that, in that thing in place.

179
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.610
<v 0>Well, thank you. We have to unlock and, uh,</v>

180
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.620
elevate people's humanity. I feel like, you know, in a way what you saw with me,

181
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:22.910
I think we need to activate more people. Um, you know, uh,

182
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.770
like that process. And, and I think,

183
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.000
I genuinely think our economy and our culture have put us many of us in boxes

184
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.010
where people just feel like they have like a narrow role to fill or like a

185
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:36.740
narrow set of things they can express. Uh,

186
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.030
and that if you can let them out of that box, uh, then the sky's the limit.

187
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.160
I feel like that that's what your work's about. Um, but yeah, like it's,

188
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.160
I learned a lot, uh, and we are just getting started, as you said,

189
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.980
and you're going to be there every step of the way I'm going to call you next

190
00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:56.260
time. But this time we'd have more to work with. I'm sure.

191
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.860
