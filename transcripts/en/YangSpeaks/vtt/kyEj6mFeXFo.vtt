WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>Yeah, I'm thrilled to talk to you about, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.490
what your perspective is on what the heck we are doing wrong in places like

3
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:12.960
Kentucky. Uh, so right now you have Mitch McConnell, uh,

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.420
in some quarters, a deeply unpopular man.

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.380
<v 1>Well, not just in some corners, deeply unpopular in Kentucky.</v>

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.960
And I think that's misunderstood nationally,

7
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.740
but definitely deeply unpopular, not just, you know,

8
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:30.680
in big cities or in the democratic party, but in his state,

9
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.420
he is extremely disliked.

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.020
<v 0>So let's dig into this because this isn't a very,</v>

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.870
it's a very important misconception that a lot of people might have.

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.620
So I'm just going to speak for myself outside, looking in, uh,

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.090
Mitch McConnell seems like a very, uh,

14
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.630
DC oriented guy. He's been there forever. Uh, he, he,

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310
he seems eminently unlikable. Uh,

16
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.630
and the impression is that somehow he has like this, uh,

17
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.170
mind control over the people of Kentucky where like,

18
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.000
everyone's like, Oh, Mitch, he's like somehow an institution.

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.110
That's what it looks like from the outside, looking in where you, you think, uh,

20
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.310
that like, of course I find him very unlikeable, but like you just said that,

21
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:20.330
that, um, apparently that's not unique to people outside of Kentucky.

22
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.991
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:24.050
One of the things I always get very frustrated about when I talk to people from

24
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:27.260
outside of Kentucky is they act like, and especially to be honest with you,

25
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:31.070
Democrats are side. They act like we're a bunch of idiots,

26
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.270
a bunch of dupes who don't understand how bad Mitch McConnell is. And gosh,

27
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.350
these stupid people in Kentucky, that's not what it is. I mean, for my book,

28
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:43.040
I went to every County in Kentucky, we have 120, which is too many,

29
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.240
but we have 120.

30
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.190
And I went to every one and finding a true Mitch McConnell

31
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.050
supporter is almost impossible.

32
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.920
Nobody likes the guy and nobody likes him for the exact reason.

33
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.190
You said they don't feel like he cares about Kentucky.

34
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:01.370
They feel like he's a DC person, but here's the problem.

35
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.100
We've never as Democrats given them.

36
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:08.990
Somebody who people believe cares more than Mitch in Kentucky.

37
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.520
And I think in a lot of red States,

38
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.050
if you have a run of the mill Republican and a run of the mill Democrat,

39
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.360
people are going to vote for the Republican. They just are.

40
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.900
So you have to do something different and you have to say,

41
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.480
I am different than them in a way that connects.

42
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.470
And the problem for the democratic party, in my opinion, in middle America,

43
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.550
especially is that we connect culturally,

44
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.950
but we don't connect economically.

45
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.570
And in places where the culture is not the same as a lot of the mainstream parts

46
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.600
of the democratic party, they just have no connection to the democratic party.

47
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.130
So we have stopped talking about blue collar issues, or we don't do it enough.

48
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.290
And that is how you use to win.

49
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.430
And Kentucky Democrats used to run this state forever and they talked about blue

50
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:56.330
collar. This is a working class state. This used to be a big union state.

51
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.150
And when does the last time you've heard a Democrat talk about unions,

52
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.450
don't talk about unions. They don't ever, and they,

53
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.920
coal mining unions were huge here. Steel unions. Like they, uh, look, you know,

54
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.420
this was a union place and people just don't ever bring it up. And thus,

55
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.020
since the culture Wars become a lot of national politics,

56
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.230
it hurts in places like here. And that is why Mitch McConnell,

57
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.910
who is deeply unliked, who workers believe doesn't care about them at all.

58
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.960
When it becomes a culture war battle, they end up choosing his son.

59
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.540
<v 0>And about how Democrats have lost on the economic messaging. Uh,</v>

60
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.410
and for blue collar workers, union households,

61
00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:35.940
I experienced the same thing on the trail.

62
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.130
And one of the things that they're seeing right now between Joe and Trump is

63
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:45.060
that a lot of the union leaders are endorsing Joe and Camila because you still

64
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.310
have like a democratic relationship there,

65
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.160
but a lot of the rank and file members are voting for Trump.

66
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.200
And that happened at a very high level in 2016,

67
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.350
where the majority of these union households went to Trump,

68
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.180
no matter what their leaders said.

69
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.810
<v 1>And that's going to keep happening. If we're not careful,</v>

70
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:07.380
I think the difference, in my opinion, the reason in Michigan, Pennsylvania,

71
00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:11.430
and Wisconsin Biden is doing a little better than Clinton. Is that,

72
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:14.160
that kind of rank and file union like Joe A.

73
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.690
Little bit better than they like Hillary.

74
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:19.710
And he talked a little bit more about this stuff, but that's where we're losing.

75
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.191
You know,

76
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:25.110
I speak to union groups all the time and what my message is welcome in

77
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:26.430
those, in those places.

78
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.090
But they don't hear Democrat politicians talking about that,

79
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:32.340
certainly on the national level. Now on the state level,

80
00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:34.590
we have a democratic governor, again, Andy Beshear,

81
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.910
and a big part of that was because he spoke to teacher's unions. And,

82
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:41.790
and that was a big part of him getting elected.

83
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.050
I think we've lost that message. And, and part of the reason I really liked you,

84
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.070
I ended up endorsing you, which I had no intention of doing when I saw you with.

85
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.790
<v 0>Thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.900
<v 1>And you got up and said, so you got up and told.</v>

87
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.390
So I took my radio show to Iowa. It's a sports radio show,

88
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:01.890
but I wanted to do something to get different.

89
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:05.760
So I took them to the Iowa caucuses and we saw every candidate speak.

90
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.030
And the three guys who do the show with me, don't even care about politics.

91
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
And I was interested to see what happens at the end of this,

92
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.380
who will they be for? And everyone on our show was for you at the end.

93
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.870
And the reason was when we saw you speak,

94
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.110
you talked about the economic impact on small towns.

95
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:26.760
We saw you in a place called Perry, Iowa, and you got up and said, look,

96
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.770
no one speaks about economics in small towns and you're right, Republicans.

97
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:34.320
Don't now they'll speak about culture and social issues,

98
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.320
but they don't talk about the economics because it's their economic policy.

99
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.460
That's killing small towns and Democrats act like those places don't even exist.

100
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.550
And when you, you spoke about it and you're right,

101
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.880
America is full of small towns. And most people live in cities,

102
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.410
started in small towns and were just abandoned him, abandoning them and there.

103
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.710
And I don't know, unless we figure that out,

104
00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.830
we're going to have a where, you know, there's going to be best swaths of land,

105
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.610
where people are just isolated from the economy. And, you know,

106
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.090
dollar general store started in Kentucky. And I wrote about this in Mitch,

107
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.620
please, how they go into small towns and basically ruin the communities.

108
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:17.030
They close all the local stores. They create the only place people shop.

109
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.000
And the next thing you know, all the money gets shipped out.

110
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.670
That's what I worry about across the United States.

111
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.810
<v 0>That's a hundred percent happening right now.</v>

112
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.250
And you can see dollar general and Walmart came and ran over the mom and pops.

113
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.030
Uh, and then now Amazon is like a spaceship. That's like sucking up,

114
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.380
whatever is left. Uh, and if you're in the small town,

115
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:39.940
it's not just that you're isolated.

116
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.550
Like when your way of life starts to degrade,

117
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:45.460
then terrible things started happening. You look around like, you know,

118
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:49.930
you have people who are still living there and as the opportunities dry up, um,

119
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.830
you have people drink more people, um,

120
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.260
and end up with the domestic violence and other problems at higher levels.

121
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:02.110
Or they never married. They, they, they never, um,

122
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.040
find a partner because getting married, having a child,

123
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:10.450
they're very optimistic acts like you, you, you need a degree of stability.

124
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:12.700
If you're going to get together with someone and say, Hey, let's,

125
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.730
let's get married, let's start a family. Let's do all this stuff. Um,

126
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.410
and you start kicking out the paths forward for a lot of people. Uh,

127
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.850
you see families deteriorate very quickly or never form,

128
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.630
uh I'm with you that this is the disconnect for the democratic party.

129
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.860
The democratic party needs to not content itself with being

130
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.530
the party of the urban core or of cultural

131
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:42.220
issues. Uh, I, there was a part of me, Mt. When I was running, I was like,

132
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:45.730
is there some kind of strange agenda where people prefer it?

133
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:50.050
If we talk about these cultural issues over the, the, uh,

134
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.670
bread and butter, the dollars and cents,

135
00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:54.790
because they're just making a lot of money off us and they just want to pit us

136
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:58.570
against each other on his. And while they're laughing all the way to the bank.

137
00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.530
<v 1>I mean,</v>

138
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.730
if you were to go on Fox news or MSNBC and try to argue about tax policy,

139
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.600
you know, I mean, who nobody's going to care, but it is what's most important.

140
00:08:07.601 --> 00:08:10.870
I mean, w so I live in Kentucky. People still like Trump here.

141
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:13.780
At least a lot of people do, and I will talk to them and they'll say,

142
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:16.750
why don't you like him? And, and, and there are a million reasons,

143
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.870
but the thing that bothers me the most were his tax cuts.

144
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.770
He basically enacted Mitch McConnell's tax policy,

145
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.240
which has a hugely detrimental impact on the poor and the middle class.

146
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.630
Vis-a-vis the wealthy and people just, and it happened.

147
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:34.930
And everybody got excited because they got, you know, a check in the mail for,

148
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.150
for one time. And it,

149
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.330
it infuriates me because whatever you want to say about Trump,

150
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:43.240
and there's a lot to say when he ran. One thing he did,

151
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:46.690
I will give him credit for is he looked at these people in blue collar,

152
00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:49.450
small towns, and he said, you know what? Your lives are important.

153
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.470
Your problems exist. And I'm going to help him. Now.

154
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:56.010
He hasn't helped him and he's full of it. And he doesn't care about him,

155
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.050
but at least he acknowledged them.

156
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.830
And we in the democratic party do not acknowledge them way too often.

157
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.110
I don't think it's out of maliciousness.

158
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.650
I just don't think there are very many Democrats who know about places like

159
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:09.990
this. I mean, there are not too many shared Browns.

160
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.970
There just aren't too many of those people left that are winning elections.

161
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.980
And so you don't hear voices like mine.

162
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.410
When's the last time you heard outside of James,

163
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:23.760
Carville a Southern Twain representing the democratic party.

164
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.580
I don't know. I mean, it just does not happen.

165
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.580
And I think that leads to a lot of people, you know,

166
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:33.450
Colin Powell said many years ago about African-Americans until they can see

167
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.660
people represented that looked like them in the Republican party,

168
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.420
they're not going to join it. And he was right. Well,

169
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:41.130
what's happening is in small towns.

170
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.300
They're not seeing people like them representing the democratic party and it's

171
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.200
turning them off.

172
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.680
<v 0>And I'm living proof that if you speak to folks,</v>

173
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:54.380
they will listen because no, one's going to mistake me for

174
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.930
like someone. Um, you know who, I mean, maybe they would like,

175
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.793
I'd appreciate you.

176
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.460
<v 1>You come off as someone who genuinely cares. And most importantly,</v>

177
00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:11.780
you don't come off as someone who thinks they're better.

178
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.170
A lot of this is in places like Kentucky,

179
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.920
we are worried that you and the rest of the country looked down at us.

180
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.260
We are worried that you think we're stupid,

181
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.840
that you're thinking we don't know how to do anything.

182
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.650
And when someone talks to us like that, we turn them off. They're done.

183
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.650
Forget it. And I'm not going to call out the politicians that do that.

184
00:10:30.651 --> 00:10:33.410
But there are a lot that do you don't do that?

185
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.090
I don't think Joe Biden does that.

186
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.800
And I actually think that's why you've seen him do better than some other

187
00:10:39.801 --> 00:10:44.690
candidates is simply that notice when the democratic primaries got to the States

188
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.960
that are like that, Joe one in a heartbeat.

189
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.020
And I think you would have had success for that same reason.

190
00:10:51.021 --> 00:10:55.280
You're the only two candidates in the election that I genuinely thought spoke to

191
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:57.840
people in places like this in a way.

192
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.500
<v 0>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
