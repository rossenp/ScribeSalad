00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.190
<v 0>[Inaudible] the thing that I, you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.050
I try to explain to people is fame is a hack

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.760
for time. Fame is a hack for time.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.730
If I have to sit up here and explain to you, well, I know this woman,

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.550
she's a very good person. She's very beautiful.

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:21.240
She's married to a hip hop person. Uh she's you know, good entrepreneurs.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.560
If I could just say Kardashians, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.920
It took me three seconds and then I can move on with the conversation.

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.830
So being well known in, in an economy,

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.080
that's where basically time and attention are the biggest commodity,

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.640
like the most precious thing of money. There's a lot of money.

12
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.560
You can get it to a half. The time you got tons of money,

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.290
even rich people though are time poor.

14
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.420
The richest people in the world are some of the most time poor. And so if you,

15
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:52.140
you have to deal with that condition of the digital civilization you live in,

16
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.180
and fame is just a hack for time.

17
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.110
So I can now say gang gang on a subway,

18
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.210
and everybody knows what I'm talking about. And that's for me useful. Um,

19
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.620
the more people who know about you,

20
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.740
the easier my job is because I'm trying to promote positive solutions.

21
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.900
And yet there's this, you know, worship of attention and celebrity,

22
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:16.890
and also an understandable fear of it because it can be corrupting.

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.720
It can be isolating. It does make, you know, my life. It's very different.

24
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.940
Now that I'm a relatively well-known person,

25
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:28.470
at least among news nerds than it was before. Um, you know, uh,

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.060
and so yes, it, it, it there's a danger there,

27
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.190
but the bigger danger is that people with great ideas never get heard because we

28
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.780
are only willing to speak, you know,

29
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:43.500
to our own small Twitter followings and in our own Facebook groups.

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.970
And we're just afraid to walk on that big stage. And I think that, Hey, listen,

31
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.200
if you create a situation where there's some, you know, younger, fresher,

32
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:56.160
more edgy, less, you know, CNN ready voices,

33
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:59.250
but are still in harmony, then the movement continues to grow.

34
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.070
Even if some people are more disaffected with you,

35
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.760
but like other people who are like you, who are just maybe a little bit more,

36
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.790
you know, um, you know, grassroots. Uh, but listen,

37
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.680
I don't think that people like you can afford to keep your light under a

38
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:14.160
bushel.
