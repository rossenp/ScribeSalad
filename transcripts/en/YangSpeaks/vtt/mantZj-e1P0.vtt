1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>Small businesses are so on the rope right now.</v>

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:05.980
And I wanted to ask you about this a little bit, because you know, in,

3
00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:08.460
in some of the reading and writing that I've been doing,

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.410
like we found that there's been just a massive transfer of, of revenue,

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.300
of commerce, of wealth. You know,

6
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:19.320
you have some of these companies like Amazon, um,

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.910
and square and,

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.390
and Apple and all these huge behemoth companies to have.

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.300
<v 1>All the $2 trillion company. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.190
<v 0>And yet small businesses,</v>

11
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.160
our data shows that small businesses are down on average,

12
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:37.080
about 20 plus percent and 30% have permanently closed at this

13
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.420
point. And that's growing. And what I worry about,

14
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.990
and I want to know what you think about this is how do we put that genie back in

15
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:46.080
the bottle? Because the trend just seems really hard right now.

16
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.720
<v 1>You need to dramatically rebalance the economy.</v>

17
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:55.340
If you're going to give small businesses a chance to reopen or open a new,

18
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.010
uh, so you would need something like universal basic income, honestly,

19
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:02.480
to have a shot because you have Apple breaking 2 trillion,

20
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:05.930
you have Amazon just sucking so many businesses dry.

21
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.531
<v 0>Well.</v>

22
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.220
And I think the other complicating factor that we all need to learn together is

23
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:12.950
how does that process of change actually happen?

24
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.390
Because I think we get this wrong.

25
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.200
I think that there's a certain segment of the population right now that thinks

26
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:22.700
like demonizing Joe Biden or Donald Trump will make that change

27
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.510
happen.

28
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.460
But we've had plenty of politicians do really things that were worthy

29
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:32.480
of demonization many times in the past, and that didn't really fix it.

30
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.070
And I think if anything,

31
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.520
we need to try to find a way to rise above those things and really talk to each

32
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.460
other. So, you know, for me being from rural Idaho,

33
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.410
a lot of the people that I grew up with are our Trump Maga people, um,

34
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.670
or they're libertarians or they're people that are kind of predisposed to not

35
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:53.180
necessarily, uh, want to join some of these solutions,

36
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:54.200
like what you're talking about.

37
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.890
And what I'm finding is when I actually just see them as a human being,

38
00:01:57.891 --> 00:01:59.210
that's flawed the way I am.

39
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:02.090
That's learning the way I am and have a conversation.

40
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:05.750
And don't try to kind of like extricate them from my life because our beliefs

41
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.230
don't line up or the way we vote doesn't line up. And I just listened to them.

42
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.790
We actually can influence each other and come together. And I think, you know,

43
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.230
we need to be careful because right now the, the,

44
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.660
the predominant way of persuasion is kind of by like shaming and bullying each

45
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:21.380
other.

46
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.560
And I don't know if that's going to get people into the fold of something like

47
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.950
this. I'm pretty sure it's not Dan. And as you've shown for,

48
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:33.410
for a long time, and we're all seeing in real time, unfortunately right now,

49
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.250
like we need these changes. These changes are not really optional.

50
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:39.260
If we want to protect our way of life,

51
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.060
which means using a sub optimal form of connection, persuasion,

52
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:45.620
influence, whatever you want to call it.

53
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.410
I don't know that we can afford to do that right now.

54
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:51.950
And so I think a lot of people kind of on the liberal side of the equation,

55
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.401
you know,

56
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.330
need to soften up and engage a little bit more and not be so kind of like harsh

57
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:57.440
and mean sometimes.

58
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 1>Or maybe even find a way to frame some of the changes that we're</v>

59
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:06.910
making. You know, it's one reason why, uh, we, Chris and universal basic income,

60
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.570
the freedom dividend is because it tested better with broader swaths of the

61
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.404
population.

62
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.460
<v 0>Yeah. It was hard for me to switch back. I liked it that much,</v>

63
00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:20.130
and now we're kind of back to basic income. Uh,

64
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.290
and I actually loved the freedom dividend as a branding as a way of explaining

65
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:26.124
it.

66
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.560
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, no, it is kind of funny. Um, but I,</v>

67
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.880
I think that language really helped that make the case to different types of

68
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:40.290
people. There could be some of your old neighbors in rural Idaho, it'd be like,

69
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:44.860
I'm down with the freedom dividend. It's like it's, uh, uh, and,

70
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:47.400
and what, what you're describing as like the,

71
00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:50.550
the barriers between us and trying to make the case of different types of

72
00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:54.060
people, just like you have these market centers around how companies treat their

73
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:58.050
workers. Unfortunately, there are market centers around politics where, uh,

74
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.820
political figures get rewarded more for ginning up like a

75
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:04.750
passionate group of people, uh,

76
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:08.850
on a particular side than they do in reaching out and, uh,

77
00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:12.990
solving problems. And that's going to destroy us, but,

78
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:15.090
but it's baked into, um,

79
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.240
the way a lot of candidates have to run where they're much more concerned about

80
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:21.720
getting primary primary by someone in their district,

81
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.700
because they're a safe seat, uh,

82
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.570
than they are in reaching to out to different types of people.

83
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.950
<v 0>I mean, I, I've been trying to write and encourage people lately. Like, Hey,</v>

84
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:35.910
like I get that there's a lot of horrible things happening,

85
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.910
but like putting some focus on the solutions,

86
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.620
putting some focus on the changes that we want to have happen is really our

87
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:45.030
best bet in this situation.

88
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:49.440
More so than the latest scandal that's going to keep us kind of all ginned up

89
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:50.580
for an extra week or two.

90
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.780
<v 1>These folks who are trying to turn us against each other, like just ignore them.</v>

91
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.040
Like the fact is we know how to solve our problems. Like you get it. I get,

92
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:02.970
it were pretty much like the same. We have the same motivations.

93
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:05.940
Like let's just come together and get this thing done. Well,

94
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:09.240
now 55% of Americans are for universal basic income.

95
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.420
And it's something like 76% are for cash relief during the pandemic,

96
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:15.270
which I have to say is going to be, uh,

97
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.630
a natural lead into universal basic income. Uh, so,

98
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.490
so Dan what's fascinating is I feel like you and I were kind of early on

99
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:26.130
this, but now many, many millions of Americans have joined us.

100
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.960
And now the big challenge is,

101
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.910
is how the heck do we restore the connection between people

102
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.380
and lawmakers, where if enough of us want something, it actually happens. Uh,

103
00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:41.370
and, and so that's something I'm now engaged with very directly,

104
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:46.320
because I see that the mechanics of our democracy are actually going to be,

105
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.720
um, something we have to solve for,

106
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.740
and then also includes our media or social media. It's, it's interesting,

107
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:55.380
but I now think that that's going to be, um,

108
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.090
one of the foremost challenges to trying to have something like universal basic

109
00:05:59.091 --> 00:05:59.924
income pass.

110
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.320
<v 0>Can you give me a little bit of the playbook on that?</v>

111
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.650
Cause that'll help me to be out there, you know, like walking the walk,

112
00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:06.700
talking the talk with you.

113
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.100
<v 1>Sure. Uh,</v>

114
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:13.270
so the first big move would be something around democracy reform,

115
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.600
like rank choice voting. So if you have ranked choice voting,

116
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:21.280
then people will, uh, be able to vote, uh,

117
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.810
more dynamically. Uh, you know, they, they,

118
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.770
they wouldn't feel like they were going to like waste their vote. Uh,

119
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.040
and then you would make, let's call it, uh,

120
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.780
were they either Democrats or Republicans,

121
00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:34.090
more responsive to different types of people in their district?

122
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:38.410
Because instead of just having to worry about like, someone probably beg them,

123
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.650
it could be that there are a couple of different points of view that they have

124
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:42.610
to account for.

125
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.010
And so if you're pro democracy then rank choice voting ought to be like

126
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:51.430
a and near absolute good. Uh, and so,

127
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.730
and it doesn't seem particularly partisan because it's not, it's like, look,

128
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
we should just try and improve our democracy. So it works better.

129
00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.590
And it's more representative, uh,

130
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.270
and you can make very compelling arguments that people on on either side, um,

131
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.010
uh, that this would just be a better form of voting. Um,

132
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.570
so that's one big thing that I I'm going to be pushing and championing because

133
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.770
it's like a process change that strikes people as reasonable on both sides.

134
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.780
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm right there with you. And I completely agree. I think also,</v>

135
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:25.960
you know, getting money out of politics, it's just, we got to figure out a way,

136
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.650
I know what the Supreme court decision it's just really hard, but like,

137
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:31.900
we just have to do it because it's going to kill us.

138
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.160
<v 1>That's exactly the kind of change that we need to make. So I was proposing as,</v>

139
00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:38.800
you know, a hundred democracy dollars for every, uh,

140
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.610
citizen so that you can just give it to your favorite candidate.

141
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:45.370
And then all of a sudden we could wash out the corporate money.

142
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.690
So that's a massive change that we need in the worst way.

143
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.990
Uh I'm for term limits for legislators,

144
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:57.580
because I just think it's too easy for someone to go to DC and then just make it

145
00:07:57.581 --> 00:08:01.150
all about preserving their spot and like climbing this ladder.

146
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:05.440
And the ladder unfortunately stretches up for decades. So if you, Dan,

147
00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:09.160
let's say you were to do something bold and run for Congress then and win.

148
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.160
And I would encourage this actually, uh,

149
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.280
till you have a business to run the rest of it. But, uh,

150
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.320
if you were to show up there, then they'd be like, all right,

151
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:20.230
now you're a low man on the totem pole go like dial for dollars.

152
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.430
And if you play your cards, right,

153
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:26.400
maybe you'll wind up on one of these awesome committees in like eight years or

154
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.140
something like that. Uh, and so the,

155
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.490
the that's not helping us solve these problems. Uh,

156
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.210
and so I think we should have term limits so that members of Congress see it as

157
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:38.710
a term of service and not like career,

158
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.290
then you go there and try and get something done and you turn around. Now,

159
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:46.060
there is a balancing act. Um, but to me, that that's necessary. Um,

160
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.490
because right now we have something of a,

161
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:51.490
gerontocracy where the average member of Congress,

162
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:53.860
I believe is about 62 years old, um,

163
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.260
which makes them a little bit behind the curve on technology issues among other

164
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:00.150
things. But, uh, but, uh, their,

165
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.570
their incentives aren't around solving our problems so much as they are staying

166
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:05.100
where they are. And,

167
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.840
and that is something that we need to address if we're going to make

168
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.310
progress. So, so these are some of the systemic fixes, um,

169
00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:15.750
I'm going to be pushing for, um,

170
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.460
in the days to come and hopefully that message first it's needed,

171
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:24.300
but hopefully that message is so loud and powerful that we can

172
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.100
override, but you know, the, the software, you know, and, and, and in your case,

173
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.840
the, in my case, it was like, you know,

174
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.510
it's like the political software and the media software and the rest of it that

175
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:36.900
we have to try and override. Um, and they interest, you know,

176
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:39.270
in DC and the rest of it, uh,

177
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.720
in economy-wide though,

178
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.570
it it's true that corporations, the,

179
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:48.450
the logic of corporations will grind us to dust.

180
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.120
It will end up turning us into just like these,

181
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.270
these cogs in the machine and the machine will eventually discard us.

182
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.790
