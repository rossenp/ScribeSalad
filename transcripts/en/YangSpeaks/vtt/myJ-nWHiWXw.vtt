00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>In storytelling, especially in film, a visual medium, it is show,</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:08.070
not tell people don't take in information, um,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.720
or they take it in much better.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.670
If it's the information is in service to a story that touches their

5
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:18.330
hearts. And, um, so the, you know,

6
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.320
science tells us that the most effective storytelling is one,

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.180
one that, um, is, is, is human centered around people.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.220
People we care about, we identify with, we relate to, um, and,

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.620
um, we release oxytocin when we watch something about someone we

10
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.880
care about and that is the love hormone. It it's, it's what makes us,

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.620
um, feel, um, attracted to somebody. It's the,

12
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.770
it's the hormone we secrete when we kiss, when we breastfeed, when we have sex,

13
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:50.670
when we hug, when.

14
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.290
<v 1>Like videos of our kids as like the one that.</v>

15
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.120
<v 0>Exactly you feel warm and fuzzy,</v>

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.750
it actually changes your body chemistry.

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.970
And then the story needs to be structured in a way where there's some tension

18
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.420
and rising tension. And if so,

19
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:12.560
that's what captures our attention and holds our attention because we secrete

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.730
cortisol and cortisol is, um, it's over Ramon.

21
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:21.470
That is from our, um, the amygdala, the fear center. And, um,

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.580
it's what, what, um, heightens our attention. Um,

23
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:30.200
so if you have rising tension in a story and you

24
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:33.950
have people who are relatable, the cortisol grabs the attention,

25
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:38.000
keeps your attention because I mean, we're in an attention starved world,

26
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.610
but even before social media and all these other things,

27
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:44.780
our brains are prone to wander, but you want someone engaged.

28
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.700
So it engages our brains. It engages our heart. And then after if,

29
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.840
if I believe strongly in structuring stories that well,

30
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:58.760
the classic story structure from like ancient times to today is there's

31
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.680
someone, that person has a goal.

32
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.490
There are obstacles in the way the person has to struggle to reach the goal.

33
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.160
We have to understand what's at stake, the bigger the stakes,

34
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.540
the harder it is to reach the goal.

35
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:11.930
The more we identify with the person and root for them,

36
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:16.400
the more we go on that emotional journey with them, which is actually, um,

37
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.840
if you, if you, um, study people's brains, when they're hooked on the story,

38
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.740
they actually, their brains, um, act like a participant,

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.570
not a spectator. So you can actually bring someone on an emotional journey.

40
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.200
And then if you end on triumph, they reach the goal.

41
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.640
You leave your viewer feeling, wow, I can do that too.

42
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.760
Um, and then it also releases dopamine,

43
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:44.330
which is kind of the reward center from the reward center of our brain.

44
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:48.350
So it leaves us feeling optimistic and hopeful. So, um, that's, that is.

45
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.360
<v 1>So it sounds like you start with oxytocin and then you get to cortisol and then</v>

46
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.040
you hope to leave them with dopamine.

47
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.150
<v 0>Right. But you end the way to do that is to, um,</v>

48
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.930
tell stories about somebody.

49
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.920
The viewer cares about whether it's the candidate, uh,

50
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.690
telling his or her own personal story where we care about the

51
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.490
person. Um, and that person's struggle.

52
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.290
Uh, it could be personal struggle.

53
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:22.120
It could be struggle of why they care so deeply about why they're

54
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:26.830
running or a certain issue, and then ending with a sense of hope.

55
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.460
Because if you leave people with no hope,

56
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.170
then they're not going to feel like they should take any action,

57
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.830
because if they're not going to be able to achieve their goal,

58
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.080
then why bother? You know, you want to, and which is, yeah.

59
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.240
<v 1>One of the criticisms, you know, I had, and like I struggled with,</v>

60
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.600
we've all seen those cheesy political ads. It's like, you know,

61
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.180
it was a black and white photo and it's like, I grew up like a, you know, the,

62
00:03:56.181 --> 00:04:00.420
the son of a cobbler or like the, like that, that,

63
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.990
that the daughter of a, um, Datcher or what, you know, I mean,

64
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:06.300
I'm making that up. Cause I don't think we have bachelors anymore, but

65
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.510
it's like, uh, like where,

66
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:14.100
where you make the person relatable and then like you make it seem like they

67
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.430
overcame this hard Scrabble background.

68
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:21.270
And then like you have some uplifting photos of them. And like,

69
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:26.100
I personally have lost patients for those political ads.

70
00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:28.860
And I know when you and I talked about this stuff,

71
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.050
like I struggled a little bit with trying to convey things in a

72
00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:38.850
way that felt personal to me that just didn't feel like artifice

73
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.910
or it's like, okay, hit this beat. He hit that beat. Um,

74
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.170
because I feel like at this point,

75
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:47.640
people have just lost all patients with political ads and communication.

76
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.420
Um,

77
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.420
but it sounds like the things you were saying appear in a lot of these political

78
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:55.320
ads. So do political ads look the way they do because they work.

79
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.150
<v 0>Uh, I don't, I don't know, but I think that execution it's always,</v>

80
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:04.530
the devil is in the details, right? It's like what I'm laying out.

81
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.920
You can like any story you can execute well,

82
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:11.820
or you can execute poorly. So I crazy horrible.

83
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.910
<v 1>They're out there, like sets out to make a bad movie,</v>

84
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:16.530
but there are a lot of bad movies that get made.

85
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.980
<v 0>Sure. And it's not paint by numbers.</v>

86
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.340
It's not like there's no formula to follow.

87
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.380
It's really about for every single person finding what is most

88
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.360
genuine to them. Um, but that doesn't mean cheesy and cheesy,

89
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.480
cheesy as how something shot. It's the music,

90
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.830
it's the graphics it's cheesy is, um, you know,

91
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:44.970
it's a quality. And so I think that, um,

92
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.760
uh, you, you know, you, you want the, um,

93
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.350
the feeling of a video to reflect the identity and

94
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:59.960
feeling of the candidate not to, because everything, again, this,

95
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.970
I hate the word authenticity because it's so overused. But like you,

96
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.770
that is one of the many reasons Andrew, why you broke it out because you didn't,

97
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.210
you didn't study.

98
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:15.110
What do other politicians do and how do people running for office?

99
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:19.820
How w how am I supposed to behave? You didn't do that. You were,

100
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:23.330
you, you always showed up as you. Um.

101
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.900
<v 1>Well, one thing that we found, uh,</v>

102
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.520
early in the campaign when we were shooting various videos or appeals where the

103
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:34.930
most effective appeal was just me talking to my cell phone camera.

104
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.390
Um, I think because of what you're describing,

105
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.670
where it strikes people as very genuine and human,

106
00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:46.510
because everyone talks to their, their phones. And so, uh,

107
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:48.250
it seemed like you couldn't fake anything.

108
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.230
And I think that that's something I've seen with younger

109
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.130
political figures where they seem really good at that. Uh, you know, I,

110
00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:02.980
I'm not sure how excellent and Instagram soliloquy deliver I

111
00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:05.440
am, uh, you know, in the scheme of things like, uh,

112
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.180
but I agree that just giving someone a glimpse into,

113
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.310
um, your moments on the trail or your, uh, you know,

114
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:18.730
like home or whatever it happens to be, uh,

115
00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:22.060
like it makes them feel like they know you in a particular way. Um,

116
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.350
I think if a politician was not able to do that, um,

117
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.050
then it, it seems like there's something missing.

118
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.660
<v 0>Well, I, you know, [inaudible] launch, uh, video was brilliant.</v>

119
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.550
Um, it wasn't hugely polished, but that didn't matter. I mean,

120
00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:40.840
in terms of how it was shot,

121
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:45.490
it actually probably was helpful that it felt so real. Um,

122
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.320
and it, it was, it was everything I just described in terms of,

123
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.780
you know, uh, her, her struggles, her journey, her why her, you know, her,

124
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.370
her being relatable, but it was, you know, um,

125
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.120
not cheesy. There was nothing cheesy about that video. So it's,

126
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.900
it's all about the execution. Um, uh, and,

127
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.950
and people being vulnerable, being themselves. I mean, you know, you,

128
00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:16.810
you seal even studies about leadership and what

129
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:21.010
builds trust and what builds loyalty among a leader,

130
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.410
if that person has credibility.

131
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.390
And then that person is vulnerable and, and,

132
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.340
and shares that they're fallible,

133
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:32.620
or that they're scared about something or that, you know,

134
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.680
shares human emotion that we all have.

135
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.480
Then people see that person as human, not superhuman,

136
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.350
you don't want to be seen as superhuman because then you don't see them.

137
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.130
<v 1>Most people probably would like to be seen as superhuman.</v>

138
