WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>We're seeing another stimulus, possibly calmed down to pike. And I was like,</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.370
if they had just done the basic income thing that Andrew Yang was running on,

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.800
maybe this wouldn't be such a horrific time to be here in this country.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.560
<v 1>You're a hundred percent right. Karen,</v>

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.240
where unfortunately now we're in like this pandemic fueled a recession that

6
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.780
could become a depression and we need to get money into people's hands.

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.230
So I've been doing my best to both make that case to members of Congress.

8
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.730
There's an emergency cash relief bill that literally 74% of Americans

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.930
support does getting money into our hands. Uh, can you think of something else,

10
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.680
74% of Americans support at this point? Like what do you,

11
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.730
what do you have to do to try and get that higher?

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.910
A majority of Republicans and Democrats.

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.740
So let's talk some sense into our legislators and get economic

14
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:52.670
relief into our hands. I wish it didn't have to be like in this, uh,

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.190
tragic and devastating a time, but it's overdue.

16
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.590
<v 0>Well, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter just announced that he's, uh,</v>

17
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.870
donating $3 million to those mayors. Uh,

18
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:07.580
I think the mayor in California Stockton has been doing it

19
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.590
successfully. So he was one of the leading ones, chocolate Lumumba,

20
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.170
Keisha Lance bottoms is a bunch of mayors.

21
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.380
<v 1>Veronica, you know, a bunch of people. Um,</v>

22
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.100
I was on a panel with mayor Tubbs of Stockton, uh,

23
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.950
last year and he said something to me. I probably,

24
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.960
probably not supposed to share, but I'll share it because you know,

25
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:30.290
whatever we're here. Um, but he said to me, after the panel, he said like,

26
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:32.720
Andrew, you can say. I could never get away with saying,

27
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.110
okay. And what he meant by that was that like, I was just up there being like,

28
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:41.270
look, we have to value people, intrinsically have to get,

29
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.960
give everyone a basic income and the rest of it. And last year he was like,

30
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:48.260
if a young black mayor were to say that, like people would be like,

31
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.310
what the heck are you talking about? He's like, but now it's not just him.

32
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:56.060
It's Keisha Lance bottoms. It's Ross, Baraka and Newark. Uh,

33
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.960
it's mayors around the country and they're going to be many more because if

34
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.570
you're a mayor and you see what's happening in your community,

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.720
you're going to say like, wait a minute. Like we need to do things differently.

36
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.540
<v 0>So, so tell me what the disconnect is. And I've watched it around welfare.</v>

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.441
I've watched it.

38
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:16.700
There's like this notion in this country that if we give somebody something that

39
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:21.500
somehow it takes something away from me. And so it is a weird thing,

40
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.840
but I literally watched the government print money,

41
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.520
trillions of dollars and give it to people and no one had a problem with it.

42
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.850
And I'm like, Oh, so we could just print money and just give it to people.

43
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.730
<v 1>Well, we could have been doing it the whole time. Karen,</v>

44
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.720
I asked that brutal truth. And Martin Luther King saw this in the sixties.

45
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:41.030
He was like, we should have a basic income today.

46
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.840
And he was killed while he was making that case.

47
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.700
And somehow we've been brainwashed into this nonsense myth that like, Oh,

48
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:53.720
we don't have enough to go around. It's been nonsense for a long time.

49
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.200
And this pandemic has demonstrated to all of us when push came to shove,

50
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:58.130
like you just said,

51
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.500
did we just $4 trillion for wall street when they needed a bailout? Yes.

52
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.070
Did we just print $4 trillion for big companies?

53
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:10.780
And to some extent ourselves, like during this pandemic, yes, we can do it.

54
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.400
We just need enough members of Congress to get on board with the fact that they

55
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.010
work for us. They don't work for Amazon.

56
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:21.700
They don't work for the giant companies that have been laughing their way,

57
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.240
all the way to the bank for the last number of years and decades.

58
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.750
<v 2>When, when you were talking about universal, basic income is, you know,</v>

59
00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:33.630
during the election cycle, et cetera. Um,

60
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.830
I was always wondering like,

61
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.540
where are there other places that actually made it work?

62
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.550
And you're given a couple of examples,

63
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.350
like even I saw recently that you had tweeted about how that work

64
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.640
is on it.

65
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.620
It's on its way to creating a floor for universal income. Right?

66
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.520
Talk about where the rest of the world he is on this.

67
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.810
Because I think it's such a foreign concept to so many, uh,

68
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.810
so many Americans that they think it's not possible. Right.

69
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.600
But there are precedents for this,

70
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.050
like literally in places throughout the world.

71
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.761
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:14.910
South Africa just announced that they're going to make it happen for everyone.

73
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.110
Uh, India is actually implementing a version of it, uh,

74
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.070
to tens hundreds of millions of people, Canada.

75
00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:27.180
They did like a full on UBI trial and an entire town for years.

76
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.860
And in that town, you saw better health, mental health, more people,

77
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:36.090
starting businesses, more people going back to school. It was beautiful.

78
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.210
And when they found that data, they were like, this is,

79
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.510
this is exactly what we should have been doing this entire time.

80
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:44.520
Like the data is like Indiana Jones, you know,

81
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:46.680
like rate as the lost Ark where like the data was like,

82
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:51.450
it's a freaking warehouse or filing cabinet where people were

83
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:54.600
trying to keep it from public eye. But then when they found it, they were like,

84
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.210
Oh my gosh. Like, so they're like you said,

85
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.300
there are examples of this happening around the world.

86
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.430
And the most compelling example,

87
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:04.620
I think tens of millions of Americans just experiences,

88
00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:08.490
like everyone got 1200 bucks and everyone liked it, loved it.

89
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.490
Like it didn't make anyone, all of a sudden being like, Oh,

90
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.340
like work is for like losers or something.

91
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.990
<v 2>Been shut down because you gave its citizens their money back, right?</v>

92
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.030
Like government didn't stop because we gave citizens some of their money back.

93
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.180
<v 1>Right? Yeah. And it helped the economy greatly. It like reduce the poverty rate,</v>

94
00:05:33.181 --> 00:05:37.560
but it also went back right into local businesses to groceries, to fuel,

95
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:38.970
to rent. Uh,

96
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.440
and we are the citizens and the re the stakeholders of the richest society in

97
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:46.710
the history of the world, like $22 trillion pre crisis,

98
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.980
we can a hundred percent afford this. Dr. King knew it in the sixties.

99
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:52.650
He was like, we can afford this. Now he was right.

100
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.290
Then it's even more true today than it was. Then

101
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.010
it's so baffling that.

102
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.580
<v 0>There's so much resistance. And it's always around this notion of laziness,</v>

103
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.580
this myth of laziness that will somehow, you know,

104
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.390
lull people into not getting up and pulling herself themselves up by the

105
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.660
bootstrap. We're talking with two Andrews, Andrew McCaskill, of course,

106
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.010
Andrew Yang.

107
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.560
You also are out talking about police reform and cash

108
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.480
relief. Talk a little bit about what, what it is. You're proposing Andrew Yang.

109
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.820
<v 1>On the police reform style side of things.</v>

110
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.370
I looked at the data because I'm a data guy, Karen, uh,

111
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.050
and the data is shocking where you're seeing cities around the

112
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:39.580
country pound over a billion dollars a year in civil suits for police misconduct

113
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.380
and brutality, uh,

114
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
and the legal standard to successfully Sue a police officer is very high.

115
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.270
So if you were seeing successful suits at over a billion dollars a year,

116
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.530
you know that the magnitude of the problem is multiple billions of dollars.

117
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.420
And this is literally bankrupting,

118
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:59.350
some towns where some cop does something reprehensible,

119
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.010
and then the entire police department gets now at this point,

120
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:04.000
you have to look at it and say,

121
00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:07.570
this is a rampant problem in is like many of the problems we're talking about

122
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:08.890
has been in place for years.

123
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.640
And when I talked to a black lives matter activists about this,

124
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:15.220
he actually hit the nail on the head. He said, look,

125
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.040
local DA's cannot control cops in their area,

126
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.980
because if you're the da in that area,

127
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:23.290
you literally rely upon law enforcement every day,

128
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.970
just to do your job and make cases.

129
00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:27.250
And then for you to turn around and being like, Hey, bad cops,

130
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:29.310
like we're going to bust you all. But like the,

131
00:07:29.311 --> 00:07:34.120
the local da is like Kamala Harris case at the same thing, she was like,

132
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.380
you know, you cannot expect the locals to do this. So what I proposed, uh,

133
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.300
was that you need a federal department of justice commission that ideally be

134
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:47.140
named after George Floyd, that all their mission was,

135
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:51.850
was to investigate issues around police misconduct. And if you're a local da,

136
00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:56.710
you would celebrate because finally it would be something that's off your plate.

137
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.460
And you know that there are issues, you know, there are bad cops in your area,

138
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.470
but you can't do much about it. And then you can just say,

139
00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:04.610
look like give it to the feds. And then the feds come in.

140
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.620
I guess the only way that you would actually be able to address this issue,

141
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.410
in my opinion, uh, around the country in a real way,

142
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:15.130
that would actually stand up over time. Thank you for listening in.
