WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>So I get that you say, look, guys,</v>

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.950
we're going to tackle real problems like healthcare and education that are

3
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:07.020
thorny and human and difficult,

4
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:11.040
and might not have the same kind of trajectory as like the, um,

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.740
the business or consumer facing tech that we're used to.

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.130
And then I get that your investors are like, wait a minute.

7
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.900
I didn't sign on for this stuff necessarily. But, you know, come on,

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
uh, Jamal, you could like pick all these winners and like easier spaces. Uh,

9
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.740
and then eventually you're like, Hey guys, like,

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.140
that's not really what I'm about. Um,

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.150
so I'm curious how many other folks have the same mindset you do where

12
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:39.000
it's like, look, I made a lot of money. I want to handle,

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.310
I want to tackle really important problems that aren't as market friendly

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690
or timeframe friendly. Um, as the stuff we customarily invest in.

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.040
<v 1>Um, there's a handful of folks. Um, I think that, um, the, the, the sort of the,</v>

16
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.520
the grandfather of the space,

17
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.390
the person who's really pioneered this path is a guy by the name of Linode

18
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:04.130
Cosla. Um, yeah, he's, uh, he's an incredible entrepreneur and his firm,

19
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.800
coastal ventures, I think has done, um,

20
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.400
huge amounts to help the world in climate change and sustainability and

21
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:14.840
agriculture. Um, he's an example. I think that there are other, um,

22
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.280
organizations actually now that are more institutional that focus on innovation.

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.900
Lux capital is an example based in New York. So there are some, um,

24
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.660
but by and large, the incentives aren't to do that,

25
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:30.500
the incentives are that you can get paid a lot of money to just basically,

26
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.530
you know, put money into things that are obvious Mark up.

27
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:38.150
Those companies raise another fund and rinse and repeat because that pays you a

28
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:42.770
great yearly compensation. And at that point, you know, it's, you, you,

29
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:44.090
you kind of have to ask yourself,

30
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.230
why would I even bother trying to solve cancer? You know, like this is crazy.

31
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.840
It's just going to take too long, too much money. I may look stupid,

32
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.450
I may get fired. And so, um, you know,

33
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:58.100
people's own simplified incentives kick in, um, and innovation stops. Yeah.

34
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.660
<v 0>It's much easier to try and jam yourself into an Airbnb or a pre IPO or</v>

35
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:05.000
something. And then like turn around and be like, Hey,

36
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.350
like I'm a genius investor.

37
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.120
<v 1>I had my annual meeting today. And what was so funny is I remember, um,</v>

38
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.790
this is for my historic venture funds, you know, and look,

39
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.620
I've put 1,000,000,003 or four into the ground. And, you know,

40
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:19.640
I told these guys, look, guys,

41
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:23.570
you're going to make somewhere between five and $6 billion. So congratulations.

42
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:27.980
It's all great. And one of my ex partners texted me and he said, you know,

43
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:32.300
these are the same guys who just got so agitated when you did a 3d, you know,

44
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:33.500
rocket printing company,

45
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.860
which is now the second most valuable space business after a space X that's

46
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:40.610
private, you know, where we did this, uh, satellite business.

47
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:43.520
That's also a multi-billion dollar business where we did a,

48
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.220
an AI chip company that's helping to, you know,

49
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:50.660
do a lot of interesting things in science. Um, you were just not rewarded.

50
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:52.670
And again, I go back to this Peter teal discussion.

51
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.570
If Peter hadn't forced me or hadn't put peer pressure on me to put so much money

52
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.410
and I would have never made those investments. Now,

53
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.870
the way that I think about it is look, you know,

54
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.090
I have a pretty like crazy

55
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.190
track record and just kind of making money, which is kind of okay. Um,

56
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.980
it's nothing that I'm particularly proud of, but I want to use it.

57
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.530
And so the way I think about it is, you know,

58
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.950
we have an organization where if you put money in a ton of money comes out,

59
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.960
we've done it for 10 years and it's like 35% of a year return. So when you put,

60
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.900
you know, five or $10 billion into a system like that,

61
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.600
every year you're spitting out two or three or 4 billion of cash,

62
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.620
but then I can take that Andrew and I can pump it into climate change and I can

63
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:39.190
pump it into education. And, you know, because it's all of our own capital,

64
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.170
all of my own capital, um,

65
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.830
I don't have to answer to anybody except the employees and the founders and the

66
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.710
market. Right. And so, you know, for example,

67
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.800
there was a really incredible innovation that came out a few weeks ago from

68
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:54.190
Google called, um, alpha fold. Now, what is that?

69
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.780
They're using machines to guess the structure of proteins,

70
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.360
and you may think, well, what does that have to do with me? Well,

71
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:02.194
as it turns out,

72
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.720
that is the basic building block to eradicate and solve

73
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.430
an enormous swath of diseases.

74
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.770
And so we have reduced an incredible problem of human health to one of

75
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.350
compute power and to one of distribution.

76
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.820
Now that's where I could easily pour a billion dollars of capital spend the next

77
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.510
10 years and say, guys, let's take, you know, crawl, walk, run, and approach.

78
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.530
And let's just have 20 or 30 really important diseases that we can, you know,

79
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.470
basically put out a business. Um,

80
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.260
and I don't have to answer to anybody except the scientists that work on the

81
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.000
projects and then the market and the people suffering from those diseases.

82
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.140
So say tomorrow faster, or, Hey, it doesn't work or, Hey,

83
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:44.920
it looks like it's working. Um, and so I find myself for the first time,

84
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.160
very happy actually like, you know,

85
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.760
reasonably content because we have this, you know,

86
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:54.280
it's kind of like being a country, Andrew, I think in like, you know,

87
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.620
like your Saudi Arabia and one day you wake up and it's like,

88
00:04:56.621 --> 00:05:01.300
there's oil underneath your feet. And all you have to do is just suck it out.

89
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.450
And then when you sell it in the market, you have money. Except in our case,

90
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:07.560
we have a plan with what to do with the money. You know, we,

91
00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:12.130
we have these areas that we just think need to get fixed for humanity,

92
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.000
just to thrive.

93
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.950
<v 0>That's incredible that you've gotten that kind of, uh,</v>

94
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.380
visibility into some of the thorniest problems.

95
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:21.330
And you feel like you can make headway in solving them.

96
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.930
I spent a number of years running a nonprofit that was trying to help young

97
00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:27.360
entrepreneurs in different markets around the country,

98
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.770
primarily in the Midwest and the South, I would interact with billionaires. Um,

99
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.250
and then I would say, Hey, support my nonprofit or support this thing I'm doing.

100
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.360
And, uh, if they were into it, they would make a move.

101
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.260
But even if you are a billionaire, you don't move in increments of like,

102
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.210
you know, 25, 30 million.

103
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.690
Like if they were wanting to be really supportive of my organization,

104
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:52.350
I might get one or 2 million. Um, and then I would be, you know, frankly,

105
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.510
I'll have to be like, well, that's freaking awesome because, you know,

106
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.290
$2 million is like nothing to sneeze at. Um, but,

107
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.680
but there was a sense I had that on among these billionaires.

108
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.820
I knew like they were looking at trying to solve particular problems and they

109
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:07.220
didn't think they had the resources and you're like, wow, I'm like a,

110
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.540
with a billionaire. And like, they don't think they have it. Um, so I,

111
00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:15.050
I'm curious what your mindset has been when you look at some of like the biggest

112
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.810
problems humanity is facing, uh,

113
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.740
and the scope of the problem relative to the resources that are being applied to

114
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.574
solve that problem.

115
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.310
<v 1>I, I really haven't met a problem that is really one of capital.</v>

116
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.560
Um, and I think that I have more than enough resources to solve all the problems

117
00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:37.180
that we're trying to solve, except one critical one, which is human capital.

118
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.380
And I think that's the, that's the most important thing to take away,

119
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:43.570
which is that it's not that, for example, like,

120
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.210
let's just say that you and I said, Hey,

121
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:50.770
let's go and get every single home in America to be carbon neutral.

122
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.790
Okay. That's a great goal. Right? How would we do it? Well, I can tell you,

123
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:56.170
I can tell you what the answer is.

124
00:06:56.171 --> 00:07:00.610
And the answer is actually not too complicated, which is every house has a roof.

125
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.310
Every roof can support residential solar.

126
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.380
All of that solar energy can get basically stored onsite in an

127
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:11.380
extremely safe and predictable battery.

128
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.670
And then you can give the homeowner or the apartment dweller,

129
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.470
an app that allows you to note exactly how much energy those solar cells on the

130
00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:23.200
roof has, um, has generated.

131
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.620
And then you can use it to power the home or the apartment, and whatever's less,

132
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:30.850
you could put back into the grid. So how do you solve it?

133
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.050
As it turns out it's not one of capital because you can get hundreds of billions

134
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:38.830
of dollars of project finance to do that because people spend hundreds of

135
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:42.070
billions of dollars buying the bonds of utilities every single day in the

136
00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:42.904
marketplace.

137
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.860
The really complicated part is can you get 15 or 20 engineers to build the right

138
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.970
app that allows you to basically understand how energy is managed and

139
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.370
re-circulated, can you get the right, you know,

140
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.700
battery scientists and chemists to build the right battery storage technology?

141
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.820
Can you string those batteries together across a neighborhood?

142
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.020
So what I found and I could be totally wrong,

143
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:09.400
but what I found is that most of these solutions are ones of human

144
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:14.050
capital and that it doesn't take tens or hundreds of billions of dollars.

145
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.420
People find ways of spending that much money,

146
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.940
but that's just a lot of poor planning. Now, if eventually Andrew,

147
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.860
you and I were to find a solution.

148
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.360
What I would say is it probably would cost 50 million to figure out then you,

149
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:31.990
and I would say, let's go to a small town like Palo Alto or, you know,

150
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.840
someplace and say, let's deploy that there and figure it out.

151
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.920
And then let's go to a city like Austin or Miami and say, Hey guys,

152
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.550
here's what we found. Let's go roll it out through all of Miami.

153
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:45.100
And then we would go nationwide. And along the way,

154
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.270
the capital markets are actually very liquid and would give you all that money.

155
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.410
Non-dilutive only.

156
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.340
So it's not that I intend to never work with the capital markets.

157
00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:57.030
I just think that in that early phase,

158
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.570
the single hardest thing to find is actually the people. Um,

159
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.440
and at the end of the day,

160
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.320
these solutions can be found for hundreds of millions of dollars.

161
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.220
This is why I always sort of get trapped in, you know, people,

162
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:11.100
people have approached me constantly and it's like, Hey,

163
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:14.880
what's your philanthropic strategy, your charitable strategy. And I,

164
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.500
and I say to be honest with you,

165
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.720
I think that all of these problems that I'm looking at will be solved with

166
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:25.470
technology oriented solutions. The ones that I am the most, um,

167
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.750
sympathetic to climate change, um, sustainability, agriculture,

168
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.860
um, health education. Um, and so, you know,

169
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.360
eventually we'll, I, you know, find a way to give all the money away. Sure.

170
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.950
But right now, you know,

171
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:44.580
I think it's important to recycle it till it back into for-profit businesses,

172
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:47.460
because this is how I solve the human capital problem.

173
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.170
The single biggest thing that America has right now going against it is that we

174
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:56.910
have four or five companies, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google,

175
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.280
that sucks up the enormity and the overwhelming majority of all

176
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.560
talented technical human capital.

177
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.720
Because if you are a smart young kid, you know,

178
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:12.720
a guy or a girl graduating from a college and you know how to code, or,

179
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:15.510
you know, how, you know how to do something unique,

180
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.990
how do you turn around to your family and say,

181
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.440
I'm going to go on to work at this startup for 80 grand a year or this

182
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.400
non-profit or something else versus going and getting paid a million dollars a

183
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:30.270
year at one of these big companies, it's really impossible, right? I mean,

184
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:32.760
I don't know your situation, but when I graduated,

185
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.420
that was the biggest sort of Damocles over my neck was the student debt that I

186
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:40.230
had. And so, but when they go there, what products are they working on?

187
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.870
This is unfettered free agent ism.

188
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.620
Imagine that you had a professional sports league where there was no salary cap.

189
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.970
What would you do?

190
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.190
You would go and hire and you would sign every single great player at stick them

191
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:57.180
on the bench. You be guaranteed to win a championship.

192
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.110
You'd be a monopolistic championship winner year in, year out.

193
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.510
<v 0>You're saying that they get paid to do nothing because when you say the beds,</v>

194
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.770
that's what I thought of. Yeah.

195
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.780
<v 1>No, no, no. That's, that's, that's, that is,</v>

196
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.220
that is the exact explicit strategy. Absolutely. So,

197
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.270
so this is why I think again, we have to find market-driven solutions.

198
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.170
We have to find a way to use technology to build successful for profit

199
00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:24.320
companies, because we have to convince all these people that are frankly,

200
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:27.530
withering and dying on the vine at these companies that they should be working

201
00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:31.880
at these young dynamic businesses. You know, this is the forward bleeding edge.

202
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.080
Like if you think about what happened in 1969, right?

203
00:11:36.081 --> 00:11:39.440
The Apollo project was the pinnacle of innovation in America,

204
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.780
but what did you really have in that moment?

205
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.250
But you had was an extremely diverse ecosystem where you had a public private

206
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:47.084
partnership.

207
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.510
You had the government that was basically an enormous balance sheet,

208
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.090
plus a lot of regulatory freedom and the ability to explore,

209
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.410
which then saw the germination of hundreds of companies and an ecosystem,

210
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.610
trying to get America into space and men to the moon.

211
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.150
And then back now we have the exact opposite.

212
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.110
We have the federal government that isn't exactly sure what its posture should

213
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.880
be. They work with an incredibly dated set of laws from antitrust to otherwise

214
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:17.500
section two 30 and otherwise.

215
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.150
And then we have a handful of companies that are effectively monopolies that

216
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.750
understand that their balance sheet is a tool that their balance sheet is

217
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:28.480
equivalent to most other governments in the world,

218
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.240
except maybe the United States. Right? If you,

219
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:35.650
if you put the GDP of countries on a list and then put the market cap of these

220
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:36.790
big companies together,

221
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.700
these five companies are probably top 50 countries. Sure. Right.

222
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.370
And so, and so, yeah, you can greenmail people.

223
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.900
You can basically work on all kinds of nonsense, nonsense, and random stuff.

224
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.490
And as a result, innovation slows down, um,

225
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.520
progress slows down as a result,

226
00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:02.230
wage growth slows down as a result people's frustrations grow.

227
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.010
And then they point to capitalism except really, again, what it is,

228
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:10.780
is a bunch of financialization on one side and green mail and hostage taking on

229
00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:11.590
the other,

230
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.380
that it basically trapped a whole cohort of young people in working on the

231
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:15.220
things that really matter.

232
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.660
<v 0>I spent a number of years trying to counteract this.</v>

233
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:22.190
I don't know how much you know about my work with venture for America. So what,

234
00:13:22.191 --> 00:13:26.190
what, uh, we did was we recruited enterprising, young people,

235
00:13:26.191 --> 00:13:26.971
some of them technical,

236
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:31.020
some of them not to work at early stage growth companies in Detroit,

237
00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:35.880
new Orleans, Baltimore, Cleveland, um, Birmingham,

238
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.770
uh, and another half dozen cities around the country that are not New York,

239
00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:44.520
San Francisco, um, with the thought process being exactly what you described,

240
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:49.230
which is look right now, if you're a whiz kid out of a lot of places, um,

241
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.500
banks and consulting firms and tech companies will wave money at you.

242
00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:56.370
And then you will go there and you will do something that's not super, uh,

243
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.980
socially productive. And so wouldn't,

244
00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:02.940
you rather start a business in a place or help a business grow in a place that,

245
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.110
uh, could use the talent, could use the energy. You could use the help I spent,

246
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:07.920
uh,

247
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.490
six and a half years running a nonprofit that did this and has done this for,

248
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.670
at this point. Um, hundreds, maybe thousands of young people.

249
00:14:14.671 --> 00:14:17.550
And I saw the market forces. You were describing in action,

250
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:22.200
where if you're a really bright kid out of Penn and

251
00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:23.340
you go to a,

252
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.250
up in new Orleans and then you see your friends getting paid six figures.

253
00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:28.890
If it's a bank, maybe more, if it's, you know, certain,

254
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.530
certain tech firms and you look up, you're like, Oh my gosh, like,

255
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:34.980
what's going on? Am I missing out? Cause I'm here in new Orleans working for,

256
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.000
you know, a certain amount of money. It's a very difficult landscape. Um,

257
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.930
you know, venture for America had a degree of, uh,

258
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.380
of success. But also I realized the enormity of the problem.

259
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.370
<v 1>There was a tweet during the middle of the pandemic where some guy was like, um,</v>

260
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.370
he was an employee at Google and then had pretended to quit and got a job

261
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:57.500
at Facebook and then was being paid by both.

262
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.080
And because they're working from home, nobody knows

263
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.400
it's like out of Silicon Valley or office space.

264
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:07.580
And you think this is an absolute joke. And meanwhile, you know,

265
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.360
the earth is burning to the ground, you know, you know, we can't,

266
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.910
we can't even figure out how to like, uh,

267
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.450
do anything except distribute burritos by cars, to people. I mean,

268
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:18.284
it's kind of crazy.

269
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.720
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
