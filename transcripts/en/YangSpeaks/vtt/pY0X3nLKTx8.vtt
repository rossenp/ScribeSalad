00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>My listenership skews young and excuse male. Um,</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.770
and relative I would argue kind of relative to every other cohort.

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:11.400
And some of it is a good thing and overdue, but relative to other cohorts,

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.660
young men are failing and that is, they're not making,

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.410
they're not making as much progress as some other cohorts.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.300
And I I'm wondering what advice you have or what advice you would give to your

7
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:29.040
younger self or what advice you would give to two young men kind of, you know,

8
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:33.330
just starting out in their career in terms of their professional approach.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660
And I'd love to hear your thoughts or your learnings about trying to be,

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.850
you know, a good dad and a good husband.

11
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.340
<v 1>I think it's a massive UN under, uh,</v>

12
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.540
discussed topic that young men are failing in the United States of America,

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.280
but it's true. Uh, and it's in the numbers. I mean, you can see it,

14
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.270
uh, at every level. One of the things I say in my book, Scott, um,

15
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.860
is that, and I think you were raised by a single mom that's right, right. Yeah.

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.830
<v 0>Child of a single immigrant mother who lived in Deida secretary,</v>

17
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.970
our household income was never more than a $40,000. Uh,

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.950
and a warm hand of government literally grabbed me by the Scruff of my neck and

19
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:14.690
threw me forward. Uh,

20
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.550
and I worry that that warm hand is no longer as big and as caring as it used to

21
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:22.820
be. Um, but yeah, I'm, I'm the son of a single immigrant mother.

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.130
<v 1>Uh, so, uh, today 40% of kids are,</v>

23
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.730
um, born into single parent households. Uh,

24
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.120
and 90% of the time single parent household is single mother. Yep.

25
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.030
And if you look at the, the data, uh,

26
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.800
little girls who grew up with single moms actually have okay. Outcomes,

27
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.370
um, in part because, uh, girls are more adaptable,

28
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:50.060
they were better at school earlier. Uh, they've got a strong female role model.

29
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:54.260
They see supermom. Um, but if you have a little boy in that setting,

30
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.610
um, it turns out that little boys and I I'm the father to two young boys myself,

31
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.470
so I can see why this is the case,

32
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.850
but apparently a little boys are more sensitive to parental time and input and

33
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.420
the lack thereof than little girls, like they, they they're,

34
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:13.310
they're more subject to, uh, variability that way. Um,

35
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.870
and so the outcomes around boys brought up by single moms.

36
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.160
There are more adverse, uh, academic, um, progressions, uh,

37
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.170
more behavioral issues, um, and the, the data is not great. Um,

38
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.910
and, and to me, a lot of the problems that, that we see, um,

39
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.860
like cascade from, from there,

40
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:36.980
where you send them to these schools that aren't really equipped, um,

41
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.960
for people at different maturation levels.

42
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:42.350
And it turns out that boys often mature at different rates than whatever the

43
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:46.760
grade level is supposed to be. Um, uh, and then, uh, at,

44
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.570
at the college level, uh, in the last I checked, I think is something like, um,

45
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.350
43% of undergrads are men like 57 to 70%.

46
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.930
<v 0>Kind of high school. Valedictorians are young women. Now.</v>

47
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.110
<v 1>Think about that. So, so you have, uh, you have boys and men coming of age,</v>

48
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.340
and then you have an economy that has become increasingly punishing and

49
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.200
uninviting. Like it used to be, if you were a guy with a high school education,

50
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.560
you could get like a factory job and like, you know, union household,

51
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.970
middle-class life like dah, dah, dah,

52
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.160
and like all that stuff's gotten decimated, you know,

53
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.340
we've gotten rid of 4 million manufacturing jobs and the rest of it. Um,

54
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.150
and then you have a culture that like, uh, that looks at men and being like,

55
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.590
Hey, whatever happened, it's your fault?

56
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.990
<v 0>You know, it's a lot like that.</v>

57
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:31.800
That's like every room we walked into for the last 400 years we've been right.

58
00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:34.260
And all of a sudden, every room we walk into right now we're wrong.

59
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.460
So it's like cry me a river, but I do see young men feeling like,

60
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.160
kind of, they feel like they're, you know, they're,

61
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:43.110
they're in this nether Netherland right now.

62
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.170
<v 1>And that as a young guy, myself, I mean,</v>

63
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:50.040
I remember vividly when my company found in my twenties and like, you know,

64
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.880
you're like, like down on your luck and your competence is shot. Um,

65
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.310
it's hard because I, I at least speaking for myself,

66
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:59.580
like you had this real thirst to try and make something of yourself.

67
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.710
And when it feels like you can't make something of yourself,

68
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:06.630
you can like eat yourself alive. It's humiliated. Like, yeah. In my case,

69
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:07.890
my failure was very public.

70
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:11.040
Everyone knew that I tried to start this company and that it was a flop and that

71
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.640
like the rest of it. So, uh, because, you know, if you start something,

72
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:17.280
you kind of have to tell everyone you're doing it. And then when it dies,

73
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:19.830
then like everyone sees it. So it felt like for a while,

74
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:22.050
like no one was calling me and the rest of it.

75
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.800
And I remember lying on my floor being like, what did I do? And like,

76
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:30.480
I owed this a hundred thousand in debt. Um, and I think it is something where,

77
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.620
uh, you know, many, many men are not being Americans generally have been men.

78
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.470
And I think, uh, to a higher degree, like there,

79
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.180
there isn't like a clear path forward. Um, and so, you know,

80
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:46.140
like my guidance, um, would be to focus on the things that, you know,

81
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:49.490
you can control that will give you like a,

82
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:54.260
at least some form of self-development or the worst case scenario,

83
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.370
at least like comfort, where it's like, in my case,

84
00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:57.960
when things went South in my twenties,

85
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.190
like I established some fitness goals for myself, I was like, well, like, sure,

86
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:04.530
I'm a failure, but at least I'll be a fit failure.

87
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.050
I'll have a six pack. Um, uh, or,

88
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.520
or it could be like something around a relationship where, you know, it's like,

89
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:17.490
you turn around and say, look, most of my friends, like, you know,

90
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:19.800
aren't calling me now, but you know, there's one friend is calling me.

91
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.500
And so like, I'm going to try and like, um, uh,

92
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.300
pay attention to the positives in my life. Um, try and learn. I mean,

93
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:30.030
a lot of people who listen to your podcast are trying to develop their business

94
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:32.580
savvy. Um, and so that's something that I did. Like,

95
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:34.710
I tried to find people who knew more than I did,

96
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:36.960
which was everyone and then learn from them.

97
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.350
One thing that helped me a lot in that direction is reading books. Um,

98
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.500
I think podcasts are great, but I think reading books, um, to me,

99
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.890
it was like the best way to feel like I got inside someone's head. Um,

100
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.510
and w was getting a bit of like, uh, wisdom, um,

101
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.630
the single most concrete thing that happened for me positively and

102
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:57.980
professionally. Um, and this is advice I'd give to anyone is like,

103
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:02.840
just try and find someone who, uh, is ahead of you on a path that you want.

104
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.690
And then just say like, look, I will do anything under the sun for you.

105
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:09.620
I don't care what it pays or doesn't pay. I don't care what you assign me. Like,

106
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.400
I'll take out the garbage, I don't care. But just like my being, uh,

107
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.980
able to like demonstrate my value to that person in that setting, um.

108
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.170
<v 2>Would be setting.</v>

109
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.520
<v 1>Me up for at least some degree of development on the path that I wanted. Um,</v>

110
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.680
and so in my case, after my company died,

111
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.670
there was like a more established entrepreneur. Who's like, Hey, join my,

112
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.450
my little company. Um, and I just saw this guy and was like,

113
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:39.590
this guy is someone that I'd want to be when I grow up. And so like,

114
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.080
whatever this guy wants me to do, I'll do. Um,

115
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.880
and so if you can find someone who you look up to in that respect, um,

116
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.810
just trying to add value for them in any form. Um,

117
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.430
and then you'll find yourself becoming a little bit more like them over time.

118
00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.790
<v 0>Any thoughts on being a good husband and a good father? I mean.</v>

119
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.150
<v 1>Like, you know, I mean, it's a constant struggle, you know, it's like,</v>

120
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.240
you're gonna be a good dad one day. And then the next day, the next day, like,

121
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.160
you know, like a, B be a, uh, less exemplary parent,

122
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.230
um, as the same being a partner, it's like, you're married. And I mean,

123
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.570
I'm just like the luckiest guy to be married to Evelyn.

124
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:22.240
Like she put up with so much stuff, um,

125
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.590
and appreciates me for the things that I do bring to the table. Um,

126
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.630
and you know, I just have to, I tell her,

127
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:33.520
I appreciate her as often as I tell her, I love her. Um, and so a lot of,

128
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.280
a lot of the struggle I've had to deal with,

129
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.720
I think that many people can relate to is just trying to be grateful.

130
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:41.650
Like,

131
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.970
cause it's so easy to start getting down on yourself or your relationships and

132
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:49.270
being like, Oh, like I have a document on my phone. That's literally, it's like,

133
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:51.190
okay, here are the things I'm grateful for.

134
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.760
And then anytime I see myself spiraling in a negative way,

135
00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:58.870
or like snapping at my kid or like snapping at, um, you know,

136
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.510
like someone who doesn't deserve it, I'll be like, wait a minute. Like,

137
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.750
I hadn't seen my kids in like months and I missed them terribly.

138
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:08.170
And like now I'm around them and I'm like, not appreciating it, like, you know,

139
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:12.370
like you, you try and like get, get some perspective. Um, and in my case,

140
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:14.740
it's helpful to have a document. I actually refer to where it's like,

141
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:17.650
here are the things I'm grateful for. And some of the things are stupid.

142
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.460
You know, some of the things are like, Oh, I'm really grateful for my, like, uh,

143
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.960
for that pizza place. I really liked.

144
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.550
<v 0>I'm grateful for Chipola every day. Right. You have to put me on your list.</v>

145
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:30.840
You'd be like, Oh, I love that place. Like good for that. Um, so.

146
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.060
<v 1>It's like appreciate the little things and the big things.</v>

147
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:35.650
And in terms of your accomplishments,

148
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.530
have some really easy wins for yourself too. It's like, look,

149
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.150
I can't control my professional path today, but I can make sure I get like a,

150
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:45.160
you know, a little bit of nature in,

151
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:47.230
or some pushups in or whatever the hell it is.

152
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.050
Like give yourself some things that you're actually very,

153
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:54.310
very achievable and basic, and that could be like appreciating Chipotle.

154
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.070
And when did, I'm.

155
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.890
