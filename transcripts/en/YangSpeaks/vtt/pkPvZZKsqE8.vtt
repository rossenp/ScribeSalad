00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.321
<v 0>Um, so Anna,</v>

2
00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:06.030
you're one of my favorite reporters in the world in terms of just

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:10.800
seeing what's out there. Uh, and I can sense the pain,

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.890
um, in, in your voice, when you think about what is going on out there, um,

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.990
where it's your job to actually talk to people and make

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:23.520
sense of the data.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.780
So as an economics reporter right now,

8
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.990
how do you figure out just how bad the damage is?

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.560
<v 1>It's? Um, it's pretty hard. This is a really unusual recession. Um,</v>

10
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:38.300
it happened really fast.

11
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.500
It was this kind of induced recession for public health reasons.

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.230
So we had this kind of soft,

13
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:48.470
I don't want to call it a lockdown cause we never really locked down,

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.800
but this sort of withdrawal of business activity that was driven,

15
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.150
not by the federal government,

16
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:56.870
but by state and local governments and really largely by people,

17
00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:59.450
themselves being like, I don't want COVID,

18
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.400
I don't want to spread COVID I'm going to stay home. And,

19
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:06.530
and you had a pretty impressive, I was,

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.110
I was pleasantly surprised at the cares act,

21
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.980
how big it was and how aggressive it was. Um,

22
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.950
but we proceeded to do nothing on the public health front, um,

23
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.770
at a federal level. And you know,

24
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:22.580
we're nearing 200,000 people dead and now we've had this really dramatic

25
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:23.930
withdrawal of support.

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.850
So PPP is over while businesses are still struggling. Um,

27
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.860
the $600 boost is gone in UI. So that's taking,

28
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:37.040
I believe it's like $60 billion out of the economy every month.

29
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:40.490
And that's from tends to be disproportionately lower income families who are

30
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:45.200
quite likely to spend it. And so I feel like we're a little bit in that, um,

31
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.270
in that circumstance where like, you know,

32
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:51.890
the coyote runs off of the cliff and just is suspended in air for a minute.

33
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.680
Um, yeah, it was August.

34
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.750
<v 0>And I feel like gravity is now going to kick in.</v>

35
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.490
<v 1>Yeah. And we still, you know, we have these eviction, moratoria, we've not seen,</v>

36
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.690
um, a ton of evidence of a D sharp decline in consumer spending,

37
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.360
but that's certainly coming. And so it's pretty hard,

38
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:15.590
but you talk to people and people are really frightened

39
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.410
and things are really bad.

40
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.200
And we are seeing exactly what everybody thought,

41
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:22.910
which is mass business failure.

42
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.690
And that mass business failure is going to be the thing that will turn this into

43
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:28.070
something like a depression.

44
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.260
Cause like when your business shuts down for no good reason, um,

45
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.340
your employees get laid off, you go through a bankruptcy process. Um, you know,

46
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:41.030
you have some wealth affected. It has that, that, that knock on effect.

47
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:45.020
And so I'm, I'm really worried. This is, this is really bad.

48
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:49.400
And I think it's going to take quite some time to claw our way out of this.

49
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.570
Um, and I think other countries have certainly done better on the health front.

50
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.690
I think that they've also done better on the econ front. Um,

51
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.450
and the fact that we never really got control of the is, you know, culprit,

52
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.540
it is the alpha and Omega of why everything is terrible at the moment.

53
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.451
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:10.230
You referenced the fact that people are going to make the choices they made. Um,

55
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.440
and it's one of the things I find so frustrating about some of the discussions

56
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:17.820
that if a governor or the feds make a

57
00:03:17.821 --> 00:03:22.770
decision about businesses in a locality or travel restrictions or the

58
00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:23.640
lack thereof,

59
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.490
there are still going to be millions of Americans who just look up and say,

60
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:29.070
you know what? I don't think I am going to take that trip.

61
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.170
I don't think I am going to go to that restaurant.

62
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:35.940
I don't think I am necessarily, uh, going to, uh,

63
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.170
uh, hit the bar or the movie theater or whatnot. Uh, and,

64
00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:41.520
and so that set of choices,

65
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.350
we'll just have these long lasting ripple effects for as long as the virus

66
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.540
is out of control. Uh, and as someone who's run businesses myself,

67
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.440
you know, right now your appetite for, uh,

68
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.470
or risk expansion expenses is so negative right

69
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:06.240
now that I can see how that's just going to cascade through the economy when

70
00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:08.580
people start thinking, okay,

71
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.790
like I've given it a little bit of time and now I'm going to have to actually

72
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:15.210
start making the difficult decisions, the layoffs, the adjustments.

73
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.980
<v 1>Yeah. I think that that's right. Um, you know,</v>

74
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.600
if you just take the kind of capital investment portion of the economy,

75
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.280
the hit there alone is probably enough to reduce output

76
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.460
over a course of, of years. Um,

77
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.570
how are businesses supposed to plan for the future?

78
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.150
If the virus is still spreading and schools are,

79
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:42.510
she'll still shut down and everybody's still really afraid of this. And,

80
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.141
and you know,

81
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:47.640
now we're coming into flu season and people are going to be indoors. Um, it's,

82
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:52.620
it's a really impossible situation that we've put people in. And, you know,

83
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:54.970
and, and I think that this is, um, the,

84
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.750
the catastrophe is being born on the back of service workers,

85
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:01.390
low-income workers in general. Um, you know, and in terms of the,

86
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:03.360
the really negative stuff on the horizon,

87
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.020
we knew that there was going to be huge problems with state and local spending

88
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.220
lo and behold,

89
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.700
we're starting to see those layoffs and those pay cuts come through. Um,

90
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:14.130
so that's just buying us a longer recession.

91
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:17.520
And it's really frustrating because I think a lot of the issues here are

92
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:19.350
amenable to policy solutions.

93
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.270
And we are not both both Congress and the white house are just electing not to,

94
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.380
not to rely on those solutions. Um, and this is, this is going to be,

95
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.850
this is so bad.

96
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:34.320
And I felt like we had learned some lessons from the great recession in terms of

97
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.810
just spending your way out of it and just not stopping until you,

98
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:42.450
you saw wage growth down in the bottom of the income spectrum and,

99
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.040
um, uh, and employment growth kind of across, across, um,

100
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.220
educational bands and in different racial groups in all over the country. And,

101
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.460
you know, it's just, we, we, we didn't really learn those lessons. Um, and,

102
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:58.880
and so this is, this is a real, it's a mess. Um, and again, I think that,

103
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:03.110
that the data is not caught up to people's lived experience just in terms of how

104
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:03.944
bad this is, right.

105
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.250
<v 0>Um, one of the stats that I cited in my DNC speech,</v>

106
00:06:09.251 --> 00:06:14.110
which I think really is very powerful and telling is that approximately

107
00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:18.070
42% of the jobs that are being lost right now will not return.

108
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.340
And I,

109
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.350
one reason why I hit that point so hard is that there are a lot of people I

110
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.590
think, that are waiting for things to quote unquote, go back to normal.

111
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.270
And we need to get used to the fact that what we're seeing right now is actually

112
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:34.840
closer to the whatever new normal is going to be.

113
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.890
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. So, I mean, I feel like, um,</v>

114
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.750
one thing that is happening is that the kind of critical number for

115
00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:45.220
Congress, um,

116
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.540
for the federal government is not that sort of top-line how much money are you

117
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.360
spending, right? It's, it's this gap,

118
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.370
it's the gap between what the economy could be doing, um,

119
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.720
absent the pandemic and the shutdowns, um, and, and what it is doing.

120
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.980
And you need the federal government to fill that hole. However, big the hole is,

121
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.120
right? Like this is the whole notion of Kinsey and stimulus.

122
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.860
And so, you know.

123
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.570
<v 0>So how big is the whole Andy? Like, how big,</v>

124
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.320
how much do you think puts you think they should be filling?

125
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.040
<v 1>Yeah. I don't think that 3 trillion, which is, um,</v>

126
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.330
the number that they settled on and the heroes act is, is that far off,

127
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.960
even though they've already spent the 2.2 trillion in the cares act,

128
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.580
it doesn't matter. They need to spend whatever it is. Um, we'll,

129
00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:37.060
we'll bring that, that, that overall number up and they can,

130
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.930
they can do it in the most effective way possible. So, so, um,

131
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.230
we have really good measurements of this thing called the fiscal multiplier,

132
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.960
which is for every dollar of deficit spending,

133
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.630
how much more does that dollar get spent in the economy,

134
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:51.550
or how big is the impact of it?

135
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.110
And so you do something like tax cuts, it's a pretty small impact.

136
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.650
You do something like sending people with no cash cash,

137
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:01.270
and it's a really big impact.

138
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.530
So unemployment insurance is one of the most effective ways to do this. Um,

139
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.170
just sending people, cash is a great way to do it.

140
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.730
Things like payroll tax holidays are really bad and inefficient way to do it.

141
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.890
So you need the number to be really big,

142
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.520
and you want it to be weighted to things that are heavily effective at fighting

143
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:19.354
a recession.

144
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.350
And instead Congress is just like sitting on their hands and not doing anything.

145
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.790
And, and we are going to see evictions. We are going to see job losses.

146
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:30.550
We are going to see business closures. We are already seeing them.

147
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.220
This is happening and we know why it's happening.

148
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.110
And we are seeing it happen in real time.

149
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.040
And the time that they needed to start passing the stimulus was like months ago,

150
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.450
not, not now.

151
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.950
And we still don't have the bill and it's creating tremendous uncertainty as you

152
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:46.780
point out because what, what,

153
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.570
what business owner is going to be investing right now,

154
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.220
who is sure of the future,

155
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.890
if the future is involving this much unnecessary death and economic

156
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:56.724
destruction?

157
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.260
<v 0>No, th th th I can sense your frustration.</v>

158
00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:04.160
I'm frustrated so many people listening to this to have, uh, become,

159
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.950
just fed up with our, uh,

160
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.730
leaders inability to act and do the basics. Uh,

161
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.590
and there's the pandemic which we are handling terribly. Uh,

162
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.220
I think that that's pretty clear to most everyone. Um,

163
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.160
and then there's the compounded economic damage,

164
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:27.140
which we are also handling terribly. And like these two things together,

165
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:31.820
they, they make people. So, um, distraught, I mean,

166
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:35.690
I I'm distraught and angry over this state of affairs.

167
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.110
Um, and, and your side too. I mean,

168
00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:43.340
I read your work and I can feel like there is this beating heart,

169
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.620
and I'm an agenda behind, um,

170
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.480
the urgency you're trying to heighten over the level of economic

171
00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:51.314
distress.

172
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.090
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. Um, this is, this is a crisis. Um,</v>

173
00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.430
and I have some, I don't know why,

174
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.390
um,

175
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.160
the sense that it is a crisis and we should be acting

176
00:10:07.161 --> 00:10:10.680
with absolute urgency is not necessarily something that,

177
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:13.040
that all people in the political system share.

178
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:16.850
I certainly think that many do and are screaming their heads off and banging

179
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:21.470
their heads against the wall, um, to try to get things done. Um,

180
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.290
but I do think that it's an argument for, um,

181
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.280
having more automatic stabilizers and taking, uh,

182
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.340
responsibility out of the hands of Congress, which is a very,

183
00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:34.550
very broken institution. I also, I mean,

184
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.420
I have a theory that I, it's just a theory, um,

185
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.460
and I have no evidence for this, but this recession,

186
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.730
the pain of this recession has been so concentrated among lower income

187
00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:51.650
workers who tend to be more disenfranchised in our political process.

188
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.320
Um, we've already seen wealth recover to roughly where it was, um,

189
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.450
before the recession and the pandemic,

190
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.290
and just a lot of the economic pain hasn't been focused up at the top.

191
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.130
And I do worry that that's maybe part of what's going on here is, you know,

192
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:10.040
the unemployment rate for people who were making a lot of money before are

193
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:14.870
highly educated is actually not that high it's gone up, but, but, but, um,

194
00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:18.560
it's been much, much, much, much higher for kind of service workers,

195
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.830
workers who might happen to have less education, um,

196
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.700
or who might have been sort of marginalized in the economy for a bunch of other

197
00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:29.510
reasons to begin with. Um, and I feel like, you know, um,

198
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.800
for high-income folks,

199
00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:34.550
this is now become about the issue of what do you do with your kids,

200
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:38.240
which is a really, really stressful and important issue. But, um,

201
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.840
the disproportionate burden of,

202
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.350
of the health crisis and the economic crisis is, is really being, um,

203
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.380
born by the people with the least capacity to manage it.

204
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.790
