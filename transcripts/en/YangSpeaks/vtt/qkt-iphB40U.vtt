00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>Google has a better sense of what we prefer than we do.</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.680
And Google certainly has a better sense of what we prefer than

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.573
our partners, too.

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.790
<v 1>I, I can vouch for that in my marriage.</v>

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.371
<v 0>You know,</v>

6
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:19.850
these algorithms are going to start making more and more of these decisions.

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.970
Why did my watch just tell me to stand? You know, we,

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.880
we've basically giving up our agency company.

9
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.310
<v 1>Really one of the big, uh,</v>

10
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.420
precursors to solving these problems in many ways is a restoration of trust.

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.290
Jack.

12
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.100
I believe that universal basic income is central to a restoration of trust.

13
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.621
Hello,

14
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:53.240
welcome to another episode of yang speaks where I sit down for a fascinating

15
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:58.160
conversation with the co-founder and CEO of both Twitter

16
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.230
and square Jack Dorsey.

17
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.360
Jack's one of the most profound thinkers on what the heck is coming next

18
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.650
in the world. And so we talked about the future of work,

19
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.610
mindfulness, universal basic income, of course,

20
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:15.560
one of my favorite subjects in the world.

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.960
How is data owned and shared what he's concerned about for the future,

22
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:24.830
what he would suggest to the president, the future of small business,

23
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.940
and after all of that, there's a really big announcement at the end.

24
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.560
So stay tuned for my sit-down conversation virtually of course,

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.723
with Jack Dorsey,

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.970
Pleasure and privilege to welcome to yang speaks the one,

27
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:48.890
the only CEO of both Twitter and square and co-founder

28
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:53.780
of both Mr. Jack Dorsey. Jack. Welcome. Thank you. So, Jack,

29
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.510
I don't know if you remember this, I've been waiting to see you to ask you this,

30
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.920
but you and I met briefly six years ago in Detroit.

31
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.600
You spoke at this Techonomy conference and I met you

32
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.550
backstage very briefly.

33
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.670
So I just wanted to take a trip down memory lane and say,

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.230
you might not remember this, but I was like Jack Dorsey back in 2014.

35
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.430
I remember now you seem like such an elevated human. Uh,

36
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.140
you also look the part kind of to,

37
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:26.000
you have like this sense of Jack from the future. Um, you have that,

38
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.580
and I think part of it is that, um, you meditate,

39
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130
uh,

40
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.770
you're mindful like you take this stuff very seriously about like awareness of

41
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:39.470
your own, um, health surroundings.

42
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.550
And I think it gives you like a connectivity to, um,

43
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.000
like the, the world at large,

44
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.230
in a way that many people don't necessarily experience. Uh,

45
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.430
but when I, uh, want to clear my head,

46
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.430
one of the things I do is try and get away from Twitter for a period of

47
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:04.750
time. And I know you have techniques that you use to try and, uh,

48
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.820
be more mindful. Uh,

49
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.240
one thing I'm curious about is whether any of the tools or techniques you use

50
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.410
utilize technology.

51
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.890
And do you think that there's a way that technology can actually make us more

52
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.780
mindful and aware as opposed to, uh, possibly the opposite?

53
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.130
<v 0>I, I do. I mean, I think, um,</v>

54
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.340
mindfulness and meditation for me is a practice of, um,

55
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.650
honing your skills of observation and making sure that we,

56
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.690
um, are present and aware of all,

57
00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:41.430
everything that we're doing and that we're not blindly reacting to it and

58
00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:46.350
just falling into a hole, but we're fully aware of the what,

59
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.340
and also the why behind it and able to make choices differently.

60
00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:55.260
So I've structured a lot of my work around, um, this concept of like,

61
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:57.990
how do I get, how do I focus more on one thing?

62
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.400
And most of my day is actually spent on,

63
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.960
on this iPhone here.

64
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.000
And the reason I use this instead of a computer is there's only one app open

65
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:13.500
at a time. So I, I definitely take my walks.

66
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:18.030
I definitely, um, meditate without a device and whatnot,

67
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.200
but I think it's more about how we train our minds to, um,

68
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.100
to, uh, to really observe it to, um, you've,

69
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.630
you've Al's book 21 lessons for 2020 first century. Um,

70
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.540
I think is phenomenal. His last chapter, his last lesson,

71
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:37.860
the 21st lesson is around meditation. He believes,

72
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.280
and I think we all feel this right now that, um,

73
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.530
Google has a better sense of what we prefer than we do.

74
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.440
And Google certainly has a better sense of what we prefer than

75
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.333
our partners.

76
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.530
<v 1>I can vouch for that in my marriage.</v>

77
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.100
<v 0>Thank you, your kids. I mean,</v>

78
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:03.300
Google will have a better sense of even who they are than they might.

79
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.760
And his recommendation is a practice of meditation actually

80
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.200
helps us understand why we're doing the things that we're doing,

81
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:14.970
why we react in the ways that we do.

82
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.250
And it's important for us to have that base level understanding and

83
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:22.170
self-awareness, um,

84
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.100
because otherwise we're just off shooting every single decision to these

85
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:30.810
algorithms. And then who are we? I mean, it's, it's the,

86
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:35.160
it's the Wall-E future that one of my favorite Pixar movies that, you know,

87
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:39.560
that that is a future where we're headed to. And, um, I,

88
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:41.670
I think meditation is one of those tools that,

89
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.000
that can at least make us aware of the choices that we're making.

90
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.730
<v 1>Agency towards technology. Uh, that that's certainly like a massive,</v>

91
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.400
uh, issue because I do have kids and to the extent that we had screen time

92
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.320
limits gone out the window with the COVID crisis, I have no idea how much,

93
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.090
how much time they're spending. Um,

94
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.120
so you just talked about how Google might know me better than my partner.

95
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.200
You've talked about how you're concerned about also the future of data

96
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:14.180
ownership. Um, and I, and it's like, I feel like with square,

97
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:15.890
you're privy to a certain form of data though.

98
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:18.800
It's much more business oriented than, um, you know,

99
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.110
people's like browsing habits and the rest of.

100
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.810
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, it just, just a high level principle. We, we,</v>

101
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.430
people need their own, their own data.

102
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.650
And I think the technology to allow that to happen across

103
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.300
service lines across company lines did not exist until recently with the

104
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:41.560
blockchain and things that blockchain presents a new opportunity for us to

105
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:45.760
create identity wallets for people. Um,

106
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.120
and then you get to choose what,

107
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.660
what services get to read from it and also get to write from it.

108
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.980
And you can turn that off at any time. I think it's,

109
00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:58.960
it's one of those ideas that, that needs to happen as quickly as possible.

110
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:02.620
And that leads to so many other beneficial things in our space.

111
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.320
<v 1>That's tremendous that that is a beautiful vision where we</v>

112
00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:12.220
actually own our data. And then there are various companies that, uh,

113
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.610
can make use of it with our permission. And we, yeah,

114
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.000
and we can turn it off at will. Um,

115
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.290
like that would be a whole different level of agency for us,

116
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.630
because right now, again, I, you know,

117
00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:28.420
you don't know really what the heck is going on, um,

118
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.670
in terms of your data getting sold and resold packaged and repackaged.

119
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.940
And, you know, what's interesting is like, I get a sense,

120
00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:39.760
a lot of the tech companies themselves, they may not know.

121
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.940
<v 0>That's true. That's true. I mean, this is, this is hard. This is hard stuff.</v>

122
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.600
I think the most important companies to actually make this happen are the folks

123
00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:51.940
that are actually deploying hardware,

124
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.290
because I think it has to happen when you buy a device. When you buy a laptop,

125
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:58.600
when you buy a phone, when you buy a tablet,

126
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.840
if I start on Android and I moved to Apple,

127
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.730
ideally all these things cross-connect connect just one wallet. Um,

128
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.510
but I do think it's,

129
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.820
it's up to the larger companies to actually make it work together and make this

130
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:14.890
a standard. Um, and then I hope they do.

131
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.150
And that's where I think smart regulation could come in, um,

132
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.100
in order to push them to do something.

133
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.500
<v 1>That is one of the frustrations I have too,</v>

134
00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:28.000
where government has been absent from most all of these issues for

135
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.770
years and decades, uh,

136
00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:34.150
where our legislators have a very dim understanding of most technology.

137
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.550
Um, we all saw when, uh, when Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress,

138
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:43.750
they were asking him all these inane questions about Facebook, its operation.

139
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:45.830
And you were like, what are you talking? Like,

140
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.000
like it wasn't like a surprise visit. You know what I mean?

141
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:51.220
They like theoretically knew he was coming and could prepare.

142
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.590
So let's imagine for a, that, um, I were present in the United States and,

143
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.840
uh, you and I were talking and you were like, well,

144
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:03.210
thank goodness that happened, Andrew. Um,

145
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.270
here are like the three things I really wish that the government could

146
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:10.680
intelligently, uh, get involved with. That would be a massive help to us.

147
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:14.610
And let's agree that universal basic income is one of them and that's happened.

148
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.380
And, you know, that's related to technology,

149
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.170
but not necessarily an intrinsically a tech issue.

150
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:22.830
Like what are the top few things that you wish an intelligent government

151
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.010
government could help with? I'd imagine AI is probably somewhere on that list.

152
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.660
<v 0>AI is definitely on that list. And I think like when I,</v>

153
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.330
when I talked to global leaders and regulators around the world, they're,

154
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.050
they're focused on the outcomes instead of the primitives being used to build

155
00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:36.890
these technologies,

156
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.410
we have to focus our regulation around the primitives being used and how things

157
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:47.120
are built rather than just putting band-aids over the outcomes. You know,

158
00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:51.410
these algorithms are going to start making more and more of these decisions and

159
00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:55.250
they're not being built in such way that it's required,

160
00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:58.610
that they explain why that would be one. You know,

161
00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:01.910
one simple piece of regulation is a,

162
00:10:01.911 --> 00:10:05.780
it's a field of research in AI called explainability really hard to do,

163
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.080
but even small steps we take there would be meaningful.

164
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.360
Why did my watch just tell me to stand? You know, just, just,

165
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.990
it's just basic things because we're offloading more and more of our decisions

166
00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:20.870
to these algorithms. And like you've all said in his book,

167
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.790
if we don't understand why we're doing it and why they're making these

168
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.440
decisions, we've just, you know,

169
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.950
we we've basically giving up our agency completely.

170
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.020
<v 1>Why did I turn left? Just that.</v>

171
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.890
<v 0>Exactly. Also when we think of AI, where we go, the algorithms,</v>

172
00:10:39.891 --> 00:10:43.600
but more important is the data. And it,

173
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:47.840
it's very hard for a startup right now to build a

174
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.580
compelling AI algorithm without access to massive

175
00:10:52.581 --> 00:10:57.500
amounts of data, which are owned by very, very few companies right now, Google,

176
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.870
Facebook, Amazon, Apple.

177
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.420
<v 1>Apparently the public sector has vast troves of data that are not being made</v>

178
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:09.860
available to commercial actors like Twitter or even

179
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:14.360
academics. Uh, this is one thing that I know we could, uh,

180
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.730
help with very quickly where the public sector governments are sitting on like

181
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:22.820
traffic patterns to whether to like, uh, you know,

182
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.490
to like a soil quality.

183
00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:30.350
Like there are things that we could do that companies could do if they had more

184
00:11:30.351 --> 00:11:31.184
access. Yeah.

185
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.640
<v 0>And, and now, and, and I think that brings to another point is like, if,</v>

186
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.030
if you were president, I would ask you like, how, how do we,

187
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.590
how do we establish a stronger partnership between technology

188
00:11:42.591 --> 00:11:47.000
companies and government and NGOs and the media,

189
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.310
because all four of these have a significant part to play in how

190
00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:57.160
society functions and there's faults in

191
00:11:57.161 --> 00:12:01.930
every single one of them right now. And, um, all of our institutions,

192
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.270
companies, media government have lost a lot of our trust and that can be very

193
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:11.770
isolating and it's very hard to solve problems with death and it could be

194
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:14.950
destructive. Yeah. So I,

195
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.870
I guess those are the three things I would ask.

196
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.670
<v 1>The, the rebuilding of trust is something I'm very passionate about Jack,</v>

197
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.560
because, you know, you can just look at the polling and see that our trust in,

198
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.240
like you said, media, government, financial institutions, uh,

199
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.560
schools, uh, hospitals, probably pre crisis.

200
00:12:34.561 --> 00:12:38.280
I think our trust has probably gone up the most trusted institution in American

201
00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:42.670
life right now. I believe it's still the U S military, uh, like the, like the,

202
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:47.340
the presidency it's collapsed and that that's pre-Trump. And so to me,

203
00:12:47.341 --> 00:12:49.200
one of the big, uh,

204
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:54.120
precursors to solving these problems in many ways is a restoration of trust. Um,

205
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.080
and so if you have these institutions that have been failing us in many,

206
00:12:58.081 --> 00:13:02.250
many regards, uh, for a long time, it's hard to then say, okay,

207
00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:06.390
that institution has been failing me for a long time, but now I trust it again.

208
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:06.930
Yeah.

209
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.430
<v 0>Exactly. I, and I think we are, we have to decompose trust,</v>

210
00:13:11.431 --> 00:13:13.560
like how do you earn trust in the first place?

211
00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:18.350
I think transparency is one way to RNM. I think, um, uh,

212
00:13:18.351 --> 00:13:20.070
accountability is another way to earn it.

213
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.890
I think reliability and being dependent is another way to earn it,

214
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.390
but there's, there's a, there's a matrix of ways to earn trust and they,

215
00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:33.900
they need to be ranked and they need to, um, they,

216
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.020
they need to be applied to all these institutions, but more importantly,

217
00:13:37.021 --> 00:13:39.030
to connections between the institutions.

218
00:13:39.031 --> 00:13:41.160
I think that is what's failing us the most right now.

219
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.440
Everyone is just so isolated.

220
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.560
<v 1>Your idea of a partnership between government media tech</v>

221
00:13:49.561 --> 00:13:52.890
companies, and NGOs is profound. We should a hundred percent do that.

222
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.070
<v 0>One thing I, I heard a lot from, uh, um, Joe,</v>

223
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.420
Sindo the prime minister of New Zealand. Um, and,

224
00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:04.320
and this was right after the Christ church call. Um, um,

225
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.390
so like she, you know, she, she also was trying to push like,

226
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.600
this is not just the government or tech technology companies.

227
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.140
This is the media too. Yeah. A lot of,

228
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.580
a lot of the videos being shared on, on Twitter after that,

229
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.660
we're not, you know, we we're, we're not individuals on Twitter.

230
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.680
They were actually reporters on Twitter, even though just into,

231
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.700
in prime minister, Jacinta in the country, he asked those not to be shared.

232
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:37.410
So we have to collaborate more. Um, otherwise, you know,

233
00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:39.960
everything that we're, we're going to be facing will just not work.

234
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.390
<v 1>You know, Jack,</v>

235
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.220
I believe that universal basic income is central to a restoration of trust.

236
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.340
Uh, where if a society actually invests in you in a way and says, Hey, look,

237
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.800
here's money. Um,

238
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.690
then you actually become more trusting and optimistic where you're like, okay,

239
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:03.860
like you actually do value me, care about me.

240
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:05.390
You'll invest in me. And my future.

241
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:08.750
You'll invest in my kids and my future because people can tell when you're

242
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:12.050
bullshitting them, honestly, it's like, if you say to them, Hey, you're great.

243
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:15.380
Like you're a citizen. It's important. Um, they're like, you know,

244
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.990
like young people at this point, I'm like, yeah, but if you're like, Hey,

245
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:20.960
you're important. We'd love you and here's money.

246
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.200
And we're not even going to tell you what to do with it. Like we trust you.

247
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.870
We love you. Um, that's actually a game changer. I can't tell you Jack,

248
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.200
like I randomly like Venmo someone money. Um,

249
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.130
and I know you've done the same thing, like, like on Twitter, but I use cash app

250
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.850
use cash app. It's the future.

251
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.840
I did Venmo. And you know, I'm, I'm not gonna lie. So other competitors do,

252
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.900
it's all good. As long as we bring in money, that's great.

253
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.120
As long as they got the money. Um,

254
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.140
but just like the act of someone receiving money, it's like,

255
00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.800
they can't believe it. Um, and just like when our government, you know,

256
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.240
even sent those $1,200 checks,

257
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:05.120
like no one believed it until it was in their account. Um,

258
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.970
like really there's so much, uh,

259
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.680
built up distrust and skepticism that when you

260
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:14.480
actually get that money,

261
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.980
like it diffuses it it's about to me actually restoring trust in

262
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.150
people, humanity, our society, our way of life,

263
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.440
the fact that we actually care about each other. I mean, I,

264
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.280
I live by the principle of everything is connected. So if someone is in pain,

265
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.410
I'm in pain ultimately over time.

266
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.480
And I want to make sure that I'm doing whatever I can in my lifetime to,

267
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:43.700
to help that through my company's works through my own personal, um,

268
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.690
giving, um,

269
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.670
in I'm in a situation that I never imagined when I was a kid or when I was 25,

270
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:54.470
or I didn't have any aspect of what money would mean

271
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:59.360
until I was probably 35. And I just,

272
00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:01.550
I I'm so grateful.

273
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:05.450
But part of gratitude is not just saying, I'm grateful.

274
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:08.510
It's doing it. Gratitude through action, man,

275
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.500
made that be like the theme of this era.

276
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.790
<v 3>All right. If you're listening to this,</v>

277
00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:28.960
you're obviously a fan of podcasts and one of the best podcasts out there is the

278
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:32.080
Jordan harbinger show. It's an Apple top 50 podcasts.

279
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:36.730
It's one of Apple's best 2018 podcasts and well, and we love it.

280
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.870
It's got a frankly,

281
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:42.790
a range of topics ranging from talking to FBI negotiators about how to deal with

282
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.050
hostage situations. Um, you've got mental health situations.

283
00:17:47.051 --> 00:17:48.340
You've got Tony Hawk on there.

284
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:51.660
You've got such wide range of topics and Jordan's such a fascinating guy.

285
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:55.500
So it's not pop psychology or superficial advice or BS,

286
00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:56.700
inspirational nonsense.

287
00:17:56.701 --> 00:18:00.960
It's a show that offers meaningful fun life-changing insights with a practical

288
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:01.230
edge.

289
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.440
And I love the worksheets cause I come away with like what I'm supposed to do

290
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:07.110
from an episode like this. Um, and there's no BS.

291
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.360
It's very straightforward and simple for someone like that.

292
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.970
<v 0>Yeah, it's really good listening. Good learning, uh,</v>

293
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.110
good information from experts that you kinda wish you had access to.

294
00:18:18.111 --> 00:18:19.280
And now Jordan's done it for you.

295
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.380
Check out the Jordan harbinger show on Jordan harbinger.com/subscribe on

296
00:18:24.381 --> 00:18:27.170
Apple, Spotify, wherever you get your podcasts.

297
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.150
I, it seems to me like you were actually ahead of me in universal basic income.

298
00:18:35.151 --> 00:18:39.560
It's not like you need an Andrew Yang, Andrew Yang. Um,

299
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:45.530
we'd love to hear from you as to like how you originally were exposed to it over

300
00:18:45.531 --> 00:18:50.270
the past number of years and how you became such a staunch believer and champion

301
00:18:50.271 --> 00:18:52.970
of it over the, over the past few years,

302
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.610
just seeing everything happening with AI and specifically

303
00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:01.610
in square. Um, we, you know,

304
00:19:01.611 --> 00:19:06.560
we serve sellers and their employees are cashiers and we can

305
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:10.970
see the writing on the wall in terms of the need for people behind those,

306
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.810
those cashiers. We saw this when we had an app called caviar,

307
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.920
which is a free delivery,

308
00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:20.810
which is basically moving the point of sale to the customer's hand.

309
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:21.470
Um,

310
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.580
the restaurants don't need someone managing the cashier anymore if they shift to

311
00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:30.560
a more, more delivery. Um, and we, we see that throughout,

312
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:36.110
um, the business and that, um, you know, we,

313
00:19:36.111 --> 00:19:40.580
we, we talk a lot about the, we talk a lot about the self-driving trucks, uh,

314
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.470
and, and whatnot. And this is even coming for programming.

315
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.300
Like a lot of the goals of machine learning and deep learning is to write the

316
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:52.550
software itself over time.

317
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.590
So a lot of entry level programming jobs will just not be as relevant anymore.

318
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.540
So every single field is going to be touched by automation and

319
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.080
UBI. To me represented a floor,

320
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.890
the floor that people could stand on, um,

321
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.690
and really have the, the knowledge and peace of mind,

322
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.610
ultimately that they could survive and eat and feed their

323
00:20:19.611 --> 00:20:24.410
children while they are learning how to transition into this new

324
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:26.750
world. It doesn't mean that they don't work.

325
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.320
It means that they have a floor with which to,

326
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.750
to build and to, um,

327
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.160
get to a skill stack that would be, um,

328
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.220
more relevant in this, in this future.

329
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.430
So I think that's one aspect of it.

330
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.830
And I think D the only way we answer these questions is your

331
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.330
experimentation. Yeah.

332
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.140
<v 1>So, so Jack, that's where we connected while I was running for president,</v>

333
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.660
that I was like, you very,

334
00:20:54.661 --> 00:20:59.100
very concerned about the impact of automation and technology,

335
00:20:59.101 --> 00:21:02.040
and you were closer to it than obviously just about anybody.

336
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.640
And one of the things I've been saying is that this pandemic,

337
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:10.260
this crisis is accelerating the rate of change that we had expected,

338
00:21:10.261 --> 00:21:14.910
where I've been saying we're seeing 10 years of progress or change in 10 weeks.

339
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.960
Uh, and is that similar to what you've seen in what you,

340
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.550
what you've seen companies investing in?

341
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.880
<v 0>Oh, yeah. I mean, like, just on the square side,</v>

342
00:21:23.881 --> 00:21:26.940
just the shift towards online has been a,

343
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.940
has been break fast and like, it's, uh,

344
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.030
it's just been incredible to see how people are,

345
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.630
are shifting and you know, that when you're, when you're online,

346
00:21:36.631 --> 00:21:39.720
you don't need a cashier. Um, so I mean,

347
00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:42.030
it does affect real lives and, uh,

348
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.400
it's certainly efficient for the business owner,

349
00:21:44.401 --> 00:21:47.100
but it's not great for their employees.

350
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.510
And that's why we need to look inwards and really make sure that we're taking

351
00:21:51.511 --> 00:21:53.850
care of, um,

352
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.680
of everyone and especially our most vulnerable, um, throughout this process as,

353
00:21:58.681 --> 00:22:03.120
as a shift happens. And I am optimistic that a shift can happen. Um, but,

354
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:08.010
but people need that peace of mind in order to just face it

355
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:08.933
in the first place.

356
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.490
<v 1>Well, yeah,</v>

357
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.120
it's hard for the shift to happen if people can't put food on the table and like

358
00:22:15.121 --> 00:22:18.600
are worrying about, um, paying next month's rent. Now,

359
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.960
I feel like square must give you one of the best dashboards into what's

360
00:22:21.961 --> 00:22:26.190
happening to small businesses right now that most anyone has.

361
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.130
I just saw this study that said, uh,

362
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.870
they think that 30% of small businesses might shut their doors forever.

363
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.910
What are you seeing at square in terms of what's happening to local

364
00:22:38.911 --> 00:22:39.744
entrepreneurs?

365
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.840
<v 0>Our sellers have been super creative, uh,</v>

366
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.470
in terms of like hacking the system and trying to figure out new ways of doing

367
00:22:46.471 --> 00:22:51.060
things. So all of our restaurants shifted to curbside pickup and delivery.

368
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.610
Um, we had a bunch of salons who shifted towards, uh, doing,

369
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.440
uh, FaceTime based or zoom based, uh, style, constant consultations.

370
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.280
Um, so a lot of creativity is emerging, but you're right. There are a lot.

371
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.690
<v 1>Of people that could use that right now.</v>

372
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:11.250
[inaudible].

373
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.120
<v 0>Hair grown everywhere.</v>

374
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.770
<v 1>I wasn't suggesting that Jack, I was just generalizing about us all.</v>

375
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.700
<v 0>It's so true. Um, but yeah,</v>

376
00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:24.180
so we are seeing a lot of creativity and I'm really optimistic about that,

377
00:23:24.181 --> 00:23:24.841
but I mean,

378
00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:29.340
the reality is that we're seeing a lot of people have to lay off all of their

379
00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:30.540
employees. Um,

380
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:35.220
we're seeing a lot of folks who are sole proprietors who have to shut down

381
00:23:35.221 --> 00:23:39.990
completely. Um, and, and for a lot of people, this is their dream. I mean,

382
00:23:39.991 --> 00:23:42.120
this has been their dream for years and years and years,

383
00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:46.370
and they worked so hard to build this up. Um, and it's just been,

384
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.930
it's been devastating. So we're,

385
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.830
we're doing everything that we can to support it, but there are limits to that.

386
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.450
And, um, one of the things I'm proud of is we were a vehicle for the,

387
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.910
for the BBP second round,

388
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.980
and we were able to get out over $500 million to our sellers, um,

389
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.870
next day, um, uh, weeks as incredible banks. Um,

390
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.970
and, uh, and it, it's,

391
00:24:11.971 --> 00:24:14.690
it's just been amazing to see that lifeline extended,

392
00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:17.600
but I don't ultimately think that's enough. We have to,

393
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:22.580
we have to figure out how these sellers will change their models. And, you know,

394
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:26.420
a lot of these things, um, some of these things will not reemerge, but some,

395
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:29.750
some will and just a different format. And that's what I'm excited to,

396
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.333
to help folks too.

397
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.740
<v 1>That makes me so happy that square was actually a conduit for some of that PPP</v>

398
00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:39.430
money, because I was thinking about those food truck operators and nail salons,

399
00:24:39.431 --> 00:24:42.550
and just thinking, how the heck are they going to access that money? You know,

400
00:24:42.551 --> 00:24:46.540
it's like a lot of them don't have like a private banker they can call.

401
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:51.820
So the fact that someone them called you and actually got that money

402
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.010
actually makes me really glad.

403
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.680
<v 0>Yeah. We had, um, uh,</v>

404
00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:01.300
over 500 million to about 60,000 sellers across the country in every,

405
00:25:01.301 --> 00:25:05.020
every state. Um, and it was from sole proprietors.

406
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.640
I think about 40% of them were employers

407
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.070
and 60% were so proprietors.

408
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.840
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, those, those are really, like you said,</v>

409
00:25:16.841 --> 00:25:17.950
they're living their dream. You know,

410
00:25:17.951 --> 00:25:22.000
they had this idea for a small business and they go out on a limb and that's one

411
00:25:22.001 --> 00:25:25.900
of the tragedies of this economic collapses, you know,

412
00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:29.350
it's affecting the local entrepreneurs the most.

413
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.840
<v 0>It's, it's also just such a massive part of our economy and every single economy</v>

414
00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:37.300
around the world, like it's over 51%.

415
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.850
The small business economy is over 51% of almost every national

416
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:43.840
economy around the world.

417
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.570
<v 1>Yeah. It's the job driver to in, in our economy and every other economy, uh,</v>

418
00:25:49.571 --> 00:25:49.930
you know,

419
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.230
and you were seeing just the seriousness of this crisis led you to do something

420
00:25:53.231 --> 00:25:56.110
that is singular in our entire country,

421
00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:01.270
which is you've pledged $1 billion in philanthropy to a combination

422
00:26:01.271 --> 00:26:05.920
of COVID relief, uh, helping girls and women and universal basic income.

423
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.710
And Jack, I got to say like, you see that headline.

424
00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:11.710
I remember you texted me when you were announcing. And I was like, I got chills.

425
00:26:11.711 --> 00:26:12.700
I told you, I was like,

426
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:17.560
that is the greatest thing I've ever seen because a billion dollars, um,

427
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.790
at the time it was reported to be something like 28% of your net worth. Uh,

428
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.910
you know, and, and so people look up and, and, you know,

429
00:26:24.911 --> 00:26:26.680
if you're worth several billion dollars, which you are,

430
00:26:26.681 --> 00:26:30.700
it's an unfathomable amount of money to the vast majority of people,

431
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.930
but then everyone can understand 28% of one's net worth.

432
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.670
Like what drove you to such a massive commitment that really is

433
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.120
a singular right now in our society.

434
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.650
<v 0>Well, I, I, I think there are a lot of,</v>

435
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.920
there are a lot of people doing things privately,

436
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.630
but I thought it was important that we added more transparency to this

437
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.400
because a lot of these things tend to be fairly dark and invisible

438
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.780
and you don't really see the impact. And, um, we,

439
00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:06.150
we launched this with a Google sheet, um,

440
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.110
which was just kind of a fast tacky way to do things, but the intention was.

441
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.960
<v 1>It was very Jack Dorsey by the way.</v>

442
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.250
<v 0>Was not, not only to show where we're giving each,</v>

443
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:24.080
each row has the amount and the org and their mission

444
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.510
and what these funds will go towards and also a link to their website for,

445
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.040
for people to, um, to click into and learn more or contribute themselves.

446
00:27:34.041 --> 00:27:38.060
So not only to track what we're doing, but also to learn, like we,

447
00:27:38.061 --> 00:27:39.560
aren't going to make mistakes in this.

448
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.550
And I want to make sure that we can annotate this sheet and just show people

449
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.100
where on why we made those mistakes.

450
00:27:46.101 --> 00:27:49.460
So I thought that transparency was really important. And the other,

451
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.030
I think creative thing that we did is, um,

452
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.320
I'm not a liquid billionaire. I have equity in these two companies.

453
00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:58.880
Um,

454
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.500
and I moved the square equity of billion dollars worth at that at that

455
00:28:03.501 --> 00:28:05.480
day to an LLC.

456
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:10.850
And that LLC then gives it to adapt over time.

457
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.090
<v 1>Uh, DAP is a donor advised fund. So the cool.</v>

458
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.260
<v 0>Thing is that, um,</v>

459
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:19.040
the original billion I get I gave in the OSC is now worth 1.5 by.

460
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.380
<v 1>Already. That's incredible. We did.</v>

461
00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.120
<v 0>Move 200 million into the Def and they sold it on the market and we now have</v>

462
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:30.680
200 million of cash to, to work with. And, um,

463
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:35.630
we've, we've now, um, we've now granted over 86 million,

464
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.850
um, of the, of the 200 so far where we've been able to move fairly fast,

465
00:28:40.851 --> 00:28:45.290
but a lot of, a lot of it has been due to the incredible work that, uh,

466
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.170
existing foundations already have. I don't want to build a foundation.

467
00:28:48.171 --> 00:28:51.440
I don't want to create a bunch of overhead and when all the money to go to the

468
00:28:51.441 --> 00:28:56.270
people that need. So it's only two people it's myself. And, um,

469
00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:01.520
my, uh, my assistant, such as chief of staff, uh, staff of Vanessa,

470
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.250
we want to keep it fairly light, um,

471
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.870
and really directed on these three problems of COVID response,

472
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.390
girls' health and education. And then, uh, universal,

473
00:29:11.391 --> 00:29:12.800
basic income experimentation.

474
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.080
<v 1>I have to say, that's the leanest thing anyone's ever heard of in philanthropy,</v>

475
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.380
two people, two people, a Google doc, uh,

476
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.080
a billion dollars. Um,

477
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.890
and we're going to use this occasion in to make an announcement, uh,

478
00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:34.340
which is that I think humanity forward actually is making that Google doc,

479
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.630
the coolest Google doc in the world.

480
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.900
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. We're, we're, we're doing a,</v>

481
00:29:38.901 --> 00:29:43.840
we're doing 5 million for humanity for it and your work. Um, and, uh,

482
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.920
and, um, I, I just, I really appreciate, um,

483
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.520
who you are first and foremost, but also what you're doing.

484
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.160
I think this idea is long overdue.

485
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.540
And I think the only way that we can change policy is by experimenting and

486
00:29:58.541 --> 00:30:02.890
showing case studies of why this works and a number of other countries have

487
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:07.300
proven small experiments as well, but we have to do it here. And, um,

488
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.700
I just, your, your voice, uh,

489
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.320
and bringing this to the public conversation and a global public conversation

490
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:15.460
has been incredible.

491
00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:20.020
And I'm just so grateful because we need this and we,

492
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.640
we need this as soon as possible.

493
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.580
<v 1>Well, thank you, Jack. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that.</v>

494
00:30:26.581 --> 00:30:30.930
And I can tell you exactly where the $5 million is going to go.

495
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.310
Um, we are going to give it to people, uh,

496
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.710
just sort of taking a page from your book.

497
00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:42.480
We're going to just turn around and distribute micro grants of generally

498
00:30:42.481 --> 00:30:47.130
$250 to thousands of people that you will make possible.

499
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:47.850
Um,

500
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.960
so I can't tell you how grateful I am personally and how grateful everyone who's

501
00:30:51.961 --> 00:30:56.610
going to be benefiting from this gift will be because I

502
00:30:56.611 --> 00:31:01.200
see the requests we get and they are Legion and

503
00:31:01.201 --> 00:31:04.500
heartbreaking. There's just so much need around the country right now.

504
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.510
And we we've been in a situation where we've raised and distributed

505
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.260
a 1.5 million or so a little bit more, uh,

506
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:18.240
but this 5 million is a godsend and is going to change thousands of lives.

507
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.930
Um, so I can't tell you how much this is going to mean to so many people.

508
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.453
<v 2>Hello.</v>

509
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:37.080
<v 1>Everyone. When I was running for president, we mailed a lot of stuff. Uh,</v>

510
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.550
and so what we did is we went to stamps.com and bought one of those cool scales.

511
00:31:41.551 --> 00:31:42.930
We had them in the office,

512
00:31:42.931 --> 00:31:47.430
it became this freaking post office out of the office that I have to say gave me

513
00:31:47.431 --> 00:31:51.440
some real pleasure every time I passed it, because, uh,

514
00:31:51.441 --> 00:31:55.650
I'm a big believer in mail in a post office.

515
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.010
I think the fact that we're talking about the post office going out of business

516
00:31:59.011 --> 00:31:59.760
is nonsense.

517
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.700
It's like the purpose of the government is to fund stuff exactly like the post

518
00:32:02.701 --> 00:32:06.480
office. Now, when you want stamps, uh,

519
00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:10.020
you can go to the post office or you can just go to stamps.com,

520
00:32:10.021 --> 00:32:14.040
which is what we did. And that was a home run for us right now,

521
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.060
listeners to yang speaks get a special offer that includes a four week trial

522
00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:22.650
plus free postage and a digital scale without any long-term commitment.

523
00:32:22.651 --> 00:32:26.580
So if you mail lots of stuff, this is your chance to just go to stamps.com,

524
00:32:26.581 --> 00:32:30.120
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in yang,

525
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.580
that stamps.com enter yang.

526
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.640
<v 0>I, I want to give up, I want to give out all my money in my lifetime.</v>

527
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:47.600
I want to see the impact, um, selfishly in my lifetime.

528
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.330
And I want to make sure that we're, we're helping people.

529
00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.540
<v 1>That's a good kind of selfish jacket.</v>

530
00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.410
<v 0>And I wanna see, I wanna see that, that impact. And that's just like, I mean,</v>

531
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.340
when you, when you build something like a Twitter or square,

532
00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.670
that the greatest value is actually seeing someone else use it,

533
00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.700
that's what drives us. It feels electric. I mean,

534
00:33:09.701 --> 00:33:13.420
the first time that we saw tweets from Iran,

535
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.390
it felt electric. It felt amazing.

536
00:33:16.391 --> 00:33:21.100
The first time we saw like one of my favorite coffee stores in San Francisco

537
00:33:21.101 --> 00:33:23.050
using square and choosing it themselves.

538
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.830
<v 1>That would be fine. Just walk in. Do you share,</v>

539
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.370
they didn't choose it because they recognize you.

540
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.250
<v 0>Um, positive. And then in the,</v>

541
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.200
even better is when my mom went into her favorite coffee store that is Louis

542
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:40.000
and she saw it there and she texted me. And, um, so like that,

543
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:45.010
that electricity that I feel in those moments is the same that I'm feeling right

544
00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:45.910
now when I give.

545
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.650
And when I know that these orgs that we're giving to are focused

546
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.420
on giving real impact and doing things that are bigger than all of us,

547
00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.420
uh, and especially me. So, um,

548
00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.240
I just want to learn as quickly as possible and how to do it the right way,

549
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.820
knowing that I'll make mistakes. Um,

550
00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:07.870
and knowing that I'll have a ton of advice coming at me because this spreadsheet

551
00:34:07.871 --> 00:34:11.860
is open. And, um, and, and that's, that's great.

552
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.610
<v 1>And I know exactly where your money's going to go,</v>

553
00:34:15.611 --> 00:34:18.400
where we're concerned that like every dollar is going to go into the hands of a

554
00:34:18.401 --> 00:34:20.680
struggling American family. And it just like,

555
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.140
like you're giving us the ability to,

556
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.960
to have that kind of impact on people's lives. Really.

557
00:34:25.961 --> 00:34:30.670
I cannot tell you how grateful I, like, just like,

558
00:34:30.671 --> 00:34:35.170
as a human being. I like, I just, it's beyond words really,

559
00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:38.980
because without someone like you making this kind of move,

560
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.780
then we're just faced with the need. Um, and like, and, you know,

561
00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:45.400
and then looking at the need and like, you,

562
00:34:45.401 --> 00:34:49.960
you have to have confidence that you're going to get resources, uh,

563
00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.750
but you don't know. And then because of you now,

564
00:34:52.751 --> 00:34:54.370
we're going to have these resources.

565
00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.850
I just hope that other people follow your example and want that same feeling

566
00:34:57.851 --> 00:35:01.750
that you just described. Jack. I hope so.

567
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:05.410
I've had that feeling too. Um, and it, it's awesome.

568
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.380
Like people called me the Asian Oprah for a little while on the trail,

569
00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:11.710
and I wasn't even doing that much,

570
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:16.210
but thanks to you, we're going to be able to do a lot more.

571
00:35:16.211 --> 00:35:20.230
And I think there's a real appetite for universal basic income right now because

572
00:35:20.231 --> 00:35:21.870
of the magnitude of the changes that we're.

573
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.540
<v 0>A hundred percent. And also because of your voice, I mean, you,</v>

574
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:29.800
you did put this on the national stage and, you know, it's been an idea that's,

575
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.830
that's talked about in this country since Martin Luther King, and maybe,

576
00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.050
maybe before that, but, um,

577
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.520
you really reminded us all of the importance of it.

578
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.450
And what I appreciated about you so much is that you S you,

579
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:46.230
you were talking about the problems of the future. That we're not,

580
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.570
we're not addressing enough right now.

581
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:53.340
Like we only have so much time to address these things. And, um, if,

582
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:58.170
if the small steps we're taking today compound into experiments

583
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:03.300
that change and inform, inform, and change policy success,

584
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.810
I mean, that's awesome. And, and the more we can do in this space, the better.

585
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

586
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.650
It's one of the frustrations I have is that we've committed 2.8 trillion or so

587
00:36:12.651 --> 00:36:15.680
at least Congress has, uh, towards relief in various forms.

588
00:36:15.681 --> 00:36:19.580
And right now there are other bills, um, being proposed, uh,

589
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:24.590
and let's call it $3 trillion. That'd be like 10,000 a person. Um,

590
00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.570
I can't help, but think that most Americans,

591
00:36:26.571 --> 00:36:29.360
if you gave them a choice between 10,000 a person,

592
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:34.790
and then a whole host of other things, like we would probably choose, uh,

593
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.310
direct relief because we're like, well, I know I'll get it.

594
00:36:37.311 --> 00:36:38.720
And I know that my neighbor will get it.

595
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.640
<v 0>I agree. I mean, like it,</v>

596
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.620
it's just a tragedy to see this money going to the banks and larger

597
00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:46.820
companies, um,

598
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.020
when it could be going into the hands of individuals in this country.

599
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.820
And they like giving people money and trusting them

600
00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:59.810
to do the right thing will have positive impact. It will.

601
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.920
And I think that the case against UBI in the, in the past has been,

602
00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.880
you can't just give everyone money because it was just wasted. No,

603
00:37:06.881 --> 00:37:07.760
that's not the case.

604
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.840
Like it will have positive impact and they will do the right things that are

605
00:37:11.841 --> 00:37:14.870
incentivized the right things, but we need to,

606
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.040
we need to trust our people and we need to trust the people of this country and

607
00:37:19.041 --> 00:37:19.874
other world.

608
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.810
<v 1>Just such a pleasure, Jack. Uh, you know, I,</v>

609
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:28.100
I feel honored to be having this conversation with you in this time of need for

610
00:37:28.101 --> 00:37:32.960
so many, um, and your role model to more than, you know, I mean, really like,

611
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:37.220
uh, just knowing that you are you and doing what you're doing,

612
00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.300
like makes me and other people feel like amazing things are possible.

613
00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:42.830
We can eradicate poverty,

614
00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.990
we can turn this crisis into something that actually accelerates positive change

615
00:37:47.991 --> 00:37:49.850
as well as negative. Um,

616
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:54.200
we can build a better way of life and you're going to be an enormous leader in

617
00:37:54.201 --> 00:37:55.100
that way.

618
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.770
<v 0>And it's been an honor to talk to our future president.</v>

619
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.740
<v 1>Well, thank you for saying so, man, um, yeah. The future matter of time.</v>

620
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.740
Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

621
00:38:06.741 --> 00:38:09.890
And I appreciate your support during the campaign to, uh, like that,

622
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.510
that meant a lot at the time. Um, and, uh, yeah, we'll be back at it, you know,

623
00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.920
uh, like the gang gang will be there and.

624
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.860
<v 0>We'll be happy to be so happy.</v>

625
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.030
<v 1>I can't wait to meet your mom. I saw her tweets. She's like,</v>

626
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.470
does that make me like the grandma Twitter, the dad,

627
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.140
she has quite a rambunctious grandchild.

628
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.140
<v 0>Yeah. She shaved you off more than, than she was bargaining for.</v>
