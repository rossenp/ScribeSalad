1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>You've launched a small business learning center for anyone trying to start a</v>

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:06.390
small business, uh, that, that you're trying to help. Um,

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
and you've launched a $50 million foundation to help small businesses and

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:15.240
families, um, called the lemonade foundation. Um, I might be missing,

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.430
uh, I mean, uh, I guess, you know,

6
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.800
that's just a play on your name at like Ramona's.

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.940
<v 1>So, you know, it's, um,</v>

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.180
the reason I launched the learning center is that one of the things that I

9
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:30.500
learned through my eight year journey with over a hundred businesses on the air

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.910
is that there's a common thread of what they were missing and they were missing

11
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:39.830
a depth of education. And the education isn't one plus one equals two,

12
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.960
or what's the capital of the state of Florida.

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.980
It's what are the real things that happen in a business from inventory

14
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:50.270
management to HR risk, to, you know, hundreds and hundreds of topics.

15
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.120
And you know that as a business owner, that those things happen.

16
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:57.830
And so I wanted to create a center where people felt a it's free

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.220
B people could do it in the privacy of their own home.

18
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.310
And there are so many folks who don't know the answer to things,

19
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.090
but they're embarrassed to admit they don't know it. Um, and I,

20
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:12.770
I'm one of those people, sometimes if you ask me a question, I may fake it. Um,

21
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.800
and I decided years ago that I wasn't going to fake it. I was going to say,

22
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.700
can you explain that to me? I don't know it. I don't understand that.

23
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.920
And I realized that the key is.

24
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.830
<v 0>Powerful. If you can acknowledge ignorance, it's very powerful.</v>

25
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.560
<v 1>It makes the other person feel, uh, I think more connected to you. Yeah,</v>

26
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.790
because you're saying like, Andrew, I don't understand how that works. And, um,

27
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.010
it, it really hit me one day. I got a call from Jamie diamond, uh, from,

28
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.450
you know, from JP Morgan. I was working on something, my phone rang, uh,

29
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.350
on the other end of the line. Hi, uh, is this Marcus? Yes. Uh, hi,

30
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:51.680
this is Jamie. Oh, okay. I didn't, I didn't know who it was.

31
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.600
I'd like to just talk to you for a few minutes.

32
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.480
Do you have a few minutes that I'm kind of in the middle of something? Um,

33
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.340
but I'm be glad cause I, I, my,

34
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.430
you could find my cell phone on the internet and I said,

35
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.210
I'd be glad to talk to you. I can't do it right now. He said, well, um,

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.070
you know, I'm your banker. And I said, Oh, okay, I'm sorry, sir.

37
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.940
I think you may have me confused. My banker is as if this woman's name, he goes,

38
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.920
no, no, I'm that woman's boss. And he said, this is Jamie diamond. I said, no,

39
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:23.660
seriously, who is this? Like, I, I I'm really busy. And he said, well,

40
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:27.350
listen, I only called, I got my, I got your phone number, uh, from Steve Burke,

41
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:31.580
who was the chairman of NBC at the time who was on the board. And he said,

42
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.070
I just want to call and tell you that, um,

43
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.470
I know you think you're only helping small business,

44
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:41.060
but you're really helping people understand the human psychology of business.

45
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.920
And that is something that you can't teach in a classroom.

46
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.710
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that,

47
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.280
and then they became chase ended up becoming like a six year sponsor of the

48
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:56.540
show. The point, the point of that is I think for me as

49
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.890
you went, like what you do and what I do all we're trying to do is just educate,

50
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.470
inform, inspire. That's it.

51
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.500
<v 0>Again, you, you, uh, acted in a way that's really, um,</v>

52
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.810
unique singular, uh,

53
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.520
because you've walked the walk for years at great personal

54
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:21.180
cost, not just in terms of, uh, financial resources,

55
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:24.270
but really the most precious thing of all, which is like your time, um,

56
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.440
energy and spirit. I'm actually going to, to explain to you what I did,

57
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:30.900
which was like my, my shot at the same problem,

58
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.220
just because I want to hear what you think. Um, so I, we,

59
00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:37.200
you and I graduated from college around the same time. Um,

60
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.230
I was not as enterprising as you. So I went to law school, uh,

61
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.640
and then after I went to law school,

62
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:44.910
I tried to start a business that did not work out and then ended up going

63
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:47.610
through sort of the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. Um,

64
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.360
and so years later after my company was acquired, uh,

65
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:56.220
in 2009 and 2011, I started a nonprofit that tried to, uh,

66
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.090
train the next generation of entrepreneur and help startups grow. Um,

67
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.150
so the organization's called venture for America. I want to see what you hear,

68
00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:04.440
what you think of this. Um,

69
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:08.400
so the thought process was that there are all of these enterprising college

70
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.590
graduates who want to learn to become someone like you.

71
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.000
But right now they go to JP Morgan and Deloitte,

72
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:19.650
these big consulting and finance shops to quote unquote, learn about business.

73
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.320
So what venture for America does venture for America,

74
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.000
puts them through a bootcamp of five weeks and then sends them to work at early

75
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:31.830
stage growth companies run by entrepreneurs in Detroit, Cleveland,

76
00:04:31.831 --> 00:04:36.150
Baltimore, and new Orleans, Birmingham, and other cities around the country.

77
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.440
So it's like a two year national entrepreneurship, apprenticeship fellowship.

78
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.550
And then at the end of two years, if they want to start their own business,

79
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:47.610
then we have investors in a seed fund to put money into them.

80
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.800
And so the goal was to try and create like an army of future use

81
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.120
essentially by sending them to work at these organizations.

82
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.600
So the way that you have like the learning center to try and teach people about

83
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:04.290
these things, though, our approach was we had that camp, but then we said, look,

84
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:08.790
just go work at the business for two years at like these formative, um,

85
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.580
twenties, you know, cause most of them are, are coming out of college.

86
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.940
<v 1>Wow. I mean,</v>

87
00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:18.000
what an amazing idea and how long has the program been running?

88
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.940
<v 0>Uh, we started it in 2011, so it's nine years in. Um,</v>

89
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.390
we have some real successes where some of the alums have started significant

90
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:29.340
enterprises. Uh, you know,

91
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:32.400
at this point I think we're responsible for something like maybe, um,

92
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.170
like a few thousand jobs, like depending upon how you calculate it.

93
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.930
Um, I should put you in touch with the CEO, but I,

94
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:44.610
I started and ran that organization full time, uh, for six and a half years.

95
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.790
And it was only after I realized that the,

96
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.940
the changes in our economy were going to be much bigger and hairier than

97
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:54.360
anything I could counteract with like my army of, uh,

98
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.730
entrepreneurs that I decided to do the, an thing of running for president.

99
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.970
<v 1>Well, you made a statement and I think it was inappropriate statement to make.</v>

100
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.160
I think you gave a lot of people, a lot of hope and, and,

101
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:09.730
and the idea of possibilities and opportunity.

102
00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:14.560
And I think that that singular moment was a huge character

103
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:15.490
defining moment.

104
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.770
The fact that you're giving young entrepreneurs a chance to work in the real

105
00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:25.090
world and then if they succeed and if they follow the program,

106
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.390
there's opportunity for them to do more is really,

107
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.470
I think at the center of what I believe in, which is,

108
00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:34.030
I want to give you a hand up,

109
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.960
but I'm not going to give you a handout and you gotta work for it.

110
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:39.460
And you got to show me you're committed to it.

111
00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:43.990
And the way you show me you're committed to it is by going to work and following

112
00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:46.630
through. I think that's amazing. How,

113
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:49.780
how can other people get involved in the organization? People like Mike.

114
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.740
<v 0>Oh, people like you. Geez, Mark is, we'll roll out the red carpet.</v>

115
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:57.790
I'll put you in touch with the CEO because you could speak at the training camp.

116
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.050
Um, you know, you could mentor some of the folks who are coming out, uh,

117
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.530
you know, you could do, you could mean invest in,

118
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.290
in some of the growth businesses. Uh, you'd love it.

119
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.940
It's essentially an army of aspiring Hughes. And,

120
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.480
uh, and, and to me, the problem is that like, if you're an aspiring, you,

121
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:18.880
I mean, you and I both had like, you know,

122
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.680
frankly like stumbles in our twenties,

123
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:22.920
cause like you're just starting to figure it out and like, and it,

124
00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:25.600
and it's a very isolating, stumbled circumstance.

125
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.520
<v 1>We had stumbles in our forties. I think yesterday.</v>

126
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.970
<v 0>You stumbled the whole time. It's true. Uh, you know, and,</v>

127
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:32.430
and I'm sharing your case too. You,

128
00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:37.030
you eventually have like a few people that you connect with on like a real human

129
00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:39.910
level, um, that understand you and what drives you.

130
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.310
That's the most beautiful thing about venture for America.

131
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:46.390
Marcus is these young people become so close to each other, uh,

132
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.960
that like imagine having that kinship early on,

133
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:51.940
where instead of people just thinking you're crazy,

134
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.750
there are at least a few other crazy people like you that are like, yeah,

135
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:56.380
I do that.

136
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.300
<v 1>There's the number of organizations out there that don't do a similar thing in</v>

137
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:04.870
practice. But in terms of principle of that comradery,

138
00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:09.820
it's like a YPO type organization where these young folks are sort of part

139
00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:12.670
of the fraternity of young entrepreneurs.

140
00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:16.360
And there's something that those lifelong relationships can never be fractured.

141
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.420
<v 0>I mean, what you've done is incredible. Um,</v>

142
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.800
and I can sense you and I saw the same need. And then, you know,

143
00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:27.880
we went after it in different ways. Uh, like, uh, so it's,

144
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.550
that's one reason why I'm such an admirer of yours is like,

145
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:34.960
I understand the spirit and the spirit of what drives you, the spirit of,

146
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:35.950
um,

147
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.510
of helping people become stronger versions of themselves through this process of

148
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:43.090
entrepreneurship in many ways. Cause like the business, the business,

149
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:46.240
but really it's about the people, uh, like it's,

150
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.800
it's so vital in American life and we don't talk about it enough. Like you're,

151
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:55.000
you're one of the primary champions that exists of this, uh,

152
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.390
w like it used to be much more built into American life.

153
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.880
Uh, but now it's less. So.

154
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.410
<v 1>I think that's one reason why your, why is that?</v>

155
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.730
<v 0>Yeah, I mean, there are a few very, very big reasons. Uh, you know,</v>

156
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.040
if someone asks me, like I say,

157
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:15.500
a lot of it is that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner,

158
00:09:15.501 --> 00:09:18.980
take all economy in the history of the world where when you and I were coming

159
00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:21.810
out of college, there was no Amazon. Like now what's Amazon.

160
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.580
Amazon is like a one to $2 trillion company that, you know,

161
00:09:25.581 --> 00:09:29.480
just like Hoovers up commerce, right. And left like a generation ago.

162
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.090
If someone were to want to start a hardware store,

163
00:09:32.091 --> 00:09:34.730
you might think that's a good idea. And then eventually, you know,

164
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.480
like the big box retailers made that a bad idea. And then I liken it.

165
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.900
The big box retailers were like tanks that came to town and the mom and pop

166
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:46.430
businesses were like, Oh, no, there's a tank. Um, and Amazon's like a spaceship.

167
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.930
And so if you're like these small business owners, you look up and you're like,

168
00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:53.800
how the hell do I compete with a spaceship? And, you know, like the,

169
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.450
the spaceship doesn't even need to make money in a given quarter.

170
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.470
This spaceship has unlimited capital unlimited data. Like, so, um, so,

171
00:10:00.471 --> 00:10:04.760
so that's one big reason why it's harder, uh, you know, uh, uh,

172
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:05.690
for young people,

173
00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:10.340
it's that the college education that you and I received in the nineties got two

174
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:12.710
and a half times more pricey at some point. Uh,

175
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:16.610
and so you have these young kids coming out who now have, you know,

176
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.300
life-changing debt in a way that like for you and me back in the nineties,

177
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.510
it was plausible that we could quote unquote, work our way through school.

178
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.600
You could actually like, make enough money to maybe pay for your school.

179
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.330
But that was back when college costs, uh, you know,

180
00:10:29.331 --> 00:10:32.840
20 to 25 grand a year and not 60 grand a year. And like, you know, it's like,

181
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.410
can, can a kid, like, you know, uh, work their way through 60 grand a year.

182
00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:39.710
It's like less likely. Uh, and then there are choices that get constrained,

183
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.361
like, uh,

184
00:10:40.361 --> 00:10:44.810
a lot of the community financial institutions that used to exist got gobbled up

185
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.940
by, you know, like the JP Morgan's of the world where like the,

186
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.490
the consolidation you see in retail for Amazon has happened in financial

187
00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:56.930
services. For sure. It happens in tech for sure. Like, uh, that, like,

188
00:10:56.931 --> 00:11:00.170
there are a lot of like the biggest industries that have become consolidated

189
00:11:00.171 --> 00:11:04.670
around like a few winners, um, you know, media and journalism's and another,

190
00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:08.150
like 2000 local newspapers gone. So if you're like a local journalist, like,

191
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.750
you know, like that that's gone. And so you,

192
00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:14.930
you have a shot if you go to New York and work for, um,

193
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.370
for NBC or like one of those, like, you know, those, those outlets persist.

194
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.090
Um,

195
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:25.010
so there's something that's been lost and people like you and I are looking at

196
00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:29.540
it and we've sensed it. And then we're like, huh, like we w what gets lost too,

197
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:34.280
is that process that makes those people into the people they aspired to be

198
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.150
like in, in some ways the people that you and I have become, uh,

199
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.460
though were kind of an earlier generation than a lot of them.

200
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.800
<v 1>Yeah. It, um,</v>

201
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.580
I worry about where we go from here.

202
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.260
And I, uh,

203
00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:53.120
along with you feel like it's time to double

204
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.820
on the young people, because I don't know what 10 years,

205
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:02.440
20 years looks like if they become disenchanted or disillusioned

206
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.880
or suppressed. And so when, when we started this foundation,

207
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.200
this $50 million foundation, it was exclusively, uh,

208
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.410
to provide financial grants, loans,

209
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.970
and equity investments to underserved communities and underserved individuals.

210
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.460
And people have said credible. Yeah, you're just,

211
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.030
you're just trying to help poor people. And I said, no,

212
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.960
I'm actually not trying to help any specific class of people,

213
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.710
other than those who have not been given the same opportunities that I was given

214
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.850
period. And so we don't need to debate it cause it's my money.

215
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.280
It kind of doesn't matter what you think I'm.

216
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.700
So it's not like I'm using your money or the government's money.

217
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.500
This is what I believe in there are women and people of color who haven't

218
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:51.550
been given the same opportunity, by the way, when they take my money,

219
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:54.790
I'm going to put them through the same paces, the same way.

220
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.570
I just want people to feel like if they had an opportunity,

221
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.720
what would they do with it? If they fail,

222
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.250
it's no different than people that are males or people that are not of color.

223
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.630
And so I just, I worry about them and I worry about our,

224
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.940
our societal disregard or lack of acknowledgement. People like to talk about it,

225
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.870
um, and say, we should start a fund. And you watch a lot of these big companies,

226
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.650
well, where we're donating a certain amount of money to this. Cause it's like,

227
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.480
it's not a, cause it's not a charity. These people are not, um,

228
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.430
they're not, they're not, unfortunately they're not, um, you know, um, uh,

229
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.300
handicap, they're not disabled. They're just, uh,

230
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.920
social and economically disabled. And I want to try to fix that.

231
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.700
Am I going to fix it? I probably won't. Am I going to try for sure.

232
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.380
<v 0>You're going to fix it. You're going to fix it for, um,</v>

233
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.450
a certain number of people. And that in itself is incredible like that.

234
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.830
Exactly. Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation.
