1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>So I, I'm a huge admirer of yours in large part because your origin story.</v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.080
So I just wanted to geek out a little bit, um,

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.280
cause you and I have a lot in common,

4
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:11.310
I don't know if you know how much we have in common. So check it out.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.530
I'm the child of Taiwanese American immigrants. Um,

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.450
my dad had a PhD in physics. Um, my mom had a master's in math.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.313
They came here,

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.820
there was this period in the sixties when the U S was letting in Taiwanese grad

9
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:28.570
students. And so they came here and they,

10
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:32.700
they met each other and then they had me and my brother, um, in the seventies,

11
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.450
uh, I think you and I might even have been born the same year. Uh,

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.690
and then I went to Phillips Exeter, uh,

13
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.620
and graduated in 92. Uh,

14
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.760
and then I wound up going to Columbia for law school where you went to

15
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:51.750
undergrad. Um, so the, the thing that blows my mind about you, Jen,

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.040
is that you and I, I think, you know, how those things in common,

17
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.080
I think you pretty much everything. I just stated, um,

18
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.620
like it could have been you talking, but then,

19
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.150
but then you did something that was so unusual, certainly for our community.

20
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:07.710
It really, for anyone. Cause you know, there aren't,

21
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:09.650
there aren't many people like you. Um,

22
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.070
so you have this education that primes you for

23
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.050
doing frankly, you know,

24
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.510
like what a lot of our peers did out of a place like Columbia,

25
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:22.590
which would be a medicine, finance consulting,

26
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:26.490
business tech in my case law, um, and the rest of it.

27
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.380
But then you took a very,

28
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:32.220
very sharp detour and became a labor organizer.

29
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:35.220
So I would love to hear how the heck that happened.

30
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.460
<v 1>Well, I had no idea. We had that many experiences in common.</v>

31
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:47.090
That's incredible. Um, thank you for naming all of that.

32
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:49.010
We have lots to talk about. Um,

33
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.570
but in terms of how I became a labor organizer when I was in college at

34
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.890
Columbia, I,

35
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.490
one of the reasons why I wanted to go to Columbia was it was in New York city

36
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.590
and the city and its energy and its diversity and

37
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:08.510
communities and the size of the Asian immigrant community and New York were

38
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.520
some of the reasons why I wanted to be there.

39
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:15.350
And I started volunteering at a domestic violence shelter for Asian immigrant

40
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.900
women, and I could still speak Mandarin.

41
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:22.070
So it was actually a value in terms of being a bilingual hotline volunteer.

42
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.470
Um, and, um,

43
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.690
and a lot of the calls were not just about the struggles

44
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.030
of surviving violence or abuse,

45
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.560
but a lot of them were about how hard it was to just survive

46
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.660
as a mom. Um, as someone working in a low wage service job,

47
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.471
you know,

48
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:47.210
I would hear from women who were domestic violence survivors who were working

49
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:48.380
in, um,

50
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.730
nail salons are doing domestic work and long,

51
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:57.590
long hours and still not able to pay the rent, um,

52
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.260
or, you know, cover the expenses related to school for kids.

53
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.490
And I just remember thinking like how could it be that there's so many people

54
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:11.320
who work so hard and do everything right and survive

55
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:16.090
so much and still can't make a decent living and take care of the

56
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.200
people they love.

57
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.430
And that kind of led me down a path of trying to figure out how we make work

58
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:26.320
better for women, especially women in our communities, women of color,

59
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.070
um,

60
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.780
women who are really struggling at the bottom of the economy where we just don't

61
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.360
value so much work. That's actually essential.

62
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.990
<v 0>There are a lot of people who fall frankly,</v>

63
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.050
volunteer at non-profits when they're in college. Um,

64
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.530
but then they don't make a career out of it in the same way that you have.

65
00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:45.810
So like the, the thing that, uh, again, I was wanting,

66
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:50.250
because I'm genuinely curious, I think you can tell is, um,

67
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.120
so you're an undergrad you're volunteering downtown. Um,

68
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.670
and then like how are you spending your summers? Like,

69
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.620
and what is your first job, um, when you graduated from school,

70
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.560
uh, and also like, how is your family taking this in,

71
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:06.860
but I'd love to start really like with, um,

72
00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:10.230
what your college career looked like and then what, what your first job was.

73
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.990
<v 1>Yeah. So in college I volunteered at the New York Asian women's shelter.</v>

74
00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:19.560
And then also at the committee against anti-Asian violence, as you mentioned,

75
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:23.490
where we started the women workers project that led to, um,

76
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.510
lots of the other work to organize domestic workers. Um,

77
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.290
and then I also on campus was involved in, um,

78
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.240
a campaign in 1996 to win ethnic studies, um,

79
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.190
on campus at Columbia. So, um, in the spring of 1996,

80
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:44.850
there was kind of a multiracial coalition of students who came together to fight

81
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:49.350
for an ethnic studies department and the combination of the

82
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:53.820
volunteering on campus or the volunteering outside of campus in the community

83
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.160
and the work to try to change how things worked on campus

84
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:03.960
and working across race. It was really transformative to me. Like I,

85
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.370
the fact that we actually waged a campaign, we took over buildings,

86
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:11.760
we went on a hunger strike, we did all kinds of stuff. And we won,

87
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.620
there's now a center for the study of ethnicity and race at Columbia

88
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.770
because of the activism that we did.

89
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:22.410
And I think I got kind of addicted to winning.

90
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.030
I just got really excited about the fact that you actually.

91
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.800
<v 0>Want for one, what else can I do?</v>

92
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.010
<v 1>Yeah, I kind of was like, Hey, you could get just like regular people together,</v>

93
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.080
get together and fight for something and make some real change that can

94
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:44.460
affect future generations. And I think I kind of caught the bug,

95
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.610
but I didn't know that you could make it a career to be honest, Andrew.

96
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.560
Yeah, no, there was no, I did not think of it as a career.

97
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:57.230
I thought maybe I would be a writer. Um, uh,

98
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.060
I was tutoring at the borough of Manhattan community college, um,

99
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.490
as a, you know, in the summers.

100
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:08.810
And then after I graduated to help people prepare for the writing assessment

101
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:10.160
test, um,

102
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.660
I thought I would like get some kind of a job to pay the bills while I wrote,

103
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.740
um, I R or something like that. Yeah, exactly.

104
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.660
I also worked in restaurants.

105
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:24.110
I was waited tables and I worked as a bartender.

106
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.200
<v 0>Like how did you figure out that activism was that actual career choice</v>

107
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.320
after you'd had this massive victory, your senior spring?

108
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.480
<v 1>I didn't really know that it was, um, we, uh, at,</v>

109
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.740
when I was working,

110
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.550
when I was volunteering at Cav and we started the women workers project,

111
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.470
the committee against anti-Asian violence,

112
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.150
we started the women workers project as kind of an all volunteer committee,

113
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.460
um, to do outreach to women,

114
00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:56.080
working in different low wage service jobs and to try to organize for better

115
00:06:56.081 --> 00:07:00.760
conditions. And, um, we were all volunteer and then,

116
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.630
um, we realized that we needed somebody full-time,

117
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.470
who would get up every day and really be thinking about how to move this work

118
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:12.790
forward and follow through and keep in touch with the workers we were meeting.

119
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.540
And, um, and we put together a job description.

120
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:20.200
We applied for some grant money to fund the position.

121
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.710
And I really didn't think that I would do that,

122
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:26.140
but when nobody applied for the job,

123
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.400
everyone in the volunteer committee convinced me to do it. Um,

124
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.210
so I started out doing it part time for awhile, and then it became full-time.

125
00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:38.800
And I think what I'll say is that even then, um,

126
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.610
I didn't think of it as my life's path. I just kind of,

127
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.860
I think I followed the women that I met and

128
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.870
organized with along the way and was so moved by the

129
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:57.100
incredible courage and resilience of the women that I would meet in the work.

130
00:07:57.101 --> 00:08:01.630
And I just kind of took their lead and kept going and,

131
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.380
um, and we would win along the way.

132
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.540
And that also kept me going.

133
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.670
<v 0>Wow. So you're kind of, you're tutoring, you're, uh,</v>

134
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.110
um, bartending and then you're volunteering.

135
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.020
And then the volunteerism gets to a point, I was like, Hey,

136
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:23.350
someone should actually start doing this. Uh, like part-time.

137
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.280
So do you remember who the original grand tours were to fund the,

138
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:29.200
this part-time and then full-time position?

139
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.680
<v 1>I think the New York women's foundation and the Ms</v>

140
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:39.970
foundation, maybe, um, the North stars.

141
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.220
Yeah. Some,

142
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.360
some of the grassroots social justice foundations in New York city

143
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.590
really important early supporters for seed projects like that.

144
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.280
<v 0>So listen to this philanthropists and funders, you end up funding these,</v>

145
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.790
uh, these positions, and then sometimes they end up, uh,

146
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.380
mushroom going into these world, changing activists doesn't happen, you know,

147
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:08.970
if you don't fund it, who knows, maybe I is, uh, is, uh,

148
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.440
doing something else right now. No, you never know. So well,

149
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:17.910
they had the pistes you gotta get in there early. Uh, so you're working,

150
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.890
um, uh, uh, eventually a full-time role, um,

151
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.180
for Cav. And then you wound up transitioning into, uh,

152
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.890
starting your own, um,

153
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.670
or organizing really domestic workers and starting an organization to that

154
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:35.940
effect. Um, what does that arc like? Because I, you know,

155
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:39.240
I can see the volunteer, I can see, okay, no one else wants to do it.

156
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:41.020
So everyone's like, hi Jen, you do it. And,

157
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.230
and one of the things that happens in these environments,

158
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.940
it's a little bit like a school project where responsibility ends up falling on

159
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:51.140
whoever the most competent person is. You know what I mean? Like, like if,

160
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:54.060
if you have like a class project and there are five of you and then there's one

161
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.850
person who's on top of it and the other four, you know, not as good,

162
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.400
so that everyone's like, Ooh, person, who's on top of it. Let's like, so I can,

163
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.460
I can imagine that happening. And I can imagine, um, you know,

164
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:06.540
you're doing it full time,

165
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.260
but then there was like this entire arc where you go from part-time to full-time

166
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:14.670
to actually starting your own organization, which is a very, very big deal. Um,

167
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.180
and this, I I'd imagine happened this arc transpired,

168
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.580
it seems like throughout your twenties. Hmm.

169
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:21.621
<v 1>Well,</v>

170
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:25.400
one thing that your listeners should really know is that none of these things

171
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:30.050
are because of singular individuals, um, or processes.

172
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.420
And at least in my experience,

173
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:37.400
I've been organizing for twenty-five years and it has always

174
00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:38.570
been a collective effort.

175
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.730
And maybe my name is on paper as the staff person or as the executive

176
00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:47.960
director or as a co-founder, but it takes, um,

177
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.160
groups of us squats. It's always a squad effort I find.

178
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.040
Um, and I'm sure you found this too with your campaign. Andrew's like, it took,

179
00:10:58.041 --> 00:10:58.370
like,

180
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.050
there was just like an essential core group every time to really take the work

181
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:06.890
to the next level. And, um, and that's really,

182
00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:10.880
I think the story of the domestic workers movement that I've been a part of has

183
00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:12.980
been, it was like a group of Filipino,

184
00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:17.720
domestic workers who decided to take the project multi-racial and then a

185
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:21.350
group of Caribbean women who decide to really expand,

186
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.300
strengthen the work in New York city together with Filipinas

187
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:29.870
and South Asian women and Latina workers.

188
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.460
And then a group of New York workers then get together with a group of

189
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:38.630
workers from LA DC, Seattle, San Francisco.

190
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.000
And then we launched the national Alliance.

191
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.010
We had 50 co-founders of the national Alliance in 2007,

192
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.760
and then a group of us, you know, in the domestic workers movement.

193
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:55.270
After the 2016 elections, you know, bunch of domestic workers said,

194
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.700
we need an advocacy platform.

195
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.170
We have to be able to use every tool at our disposal to make this

196
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:05.980
democracy, to save our democracy and to make it work for us.

197
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.840
And so that's how Karen action was formed. And it was never ever me.

198
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.150
I I'm often the fundraiser.

199
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.603
<v 2>To be honest.</v>

200
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.690
<v 1>But, um,</v>

201
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.860
there's so much leadership and so much collective leadership behind

202
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.040
every effort and every breakthrough. And,

203
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.320
and so many of the people who made this moment in the movement

204
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:34.380
possible, their names that you'll never hear of,

205
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.350
but who were absolutely essential to the work.

206
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.360
<v 2>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
