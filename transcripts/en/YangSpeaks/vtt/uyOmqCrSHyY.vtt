1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>So you talked about the need for a four day workweek or someone like to say a</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:05.880
three-day weekend.

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.900
<v 1>Yes, I did the math.</v>

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.960
<v 0>Either one of those works. So I was all right,</v>

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.600
as I looked into this and I think, you know, this,

6
00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.590
like I was looking in the history of weekends and really it started, I mean,

7
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:24.140
there's been, they've been around for awhile, but it really was a union thing.

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.890
Right. Like the unions demanded like, Hey, um,

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.310
we get two days off, like that's the move? And it was in, uh,

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.380
right after the great depression, if I recall.

11
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.930
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It was in the, um,</v>

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.280
the fair labor standards act of 1938, 40 hour work week.

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.710
Well, first let me, let me explain the thinking behind it, where right now,

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.310
uh, our work week is getting longer, not shorter. Uh,

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.230
and it's having a disastrous set of effects on

16
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:57.020
millions of people where, uh,

17
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.930
we have this mental health crisis that we talked about last week. Um, we,

18
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:05.630
we have, uh, this worship of work, work ism, um,

19
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.930
and, uh, we're sleep deprived. I mean, you can name it there,

20
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:13.010
like all these stacked effect, uh, and it's getting worse now,

21
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.690
economists like canes projected we'd have a 15 hour work week by now because

22
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:22.330
we'd be so wealthy and it turns out he was right about the level of wealth like

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.460
that, that blind was correct. Um,

24
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.860
but he obviously got the number of hours in the work week,

25
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.150
very wrong because it's been getting longer, not shorter, um, here in the us.

26
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.761
Uh,

27
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.780
and Barack Obama actually said to me that we should be looking at a shorter work

28
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:40.400
week because, uh, firms aren't going to, um,

29
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.100
employ people in the same way that they have previously.

30
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.060
So let's see what happens if you do, uh,

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.060
implement three-day weekends four day work week.

32
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.030
The big thing people say is like, well, won't you then just do 20% less work.

33
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.190
And that's not really the way it happens in real life where organizations

34
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.370
actually become more productive in many cases. Um,

35
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.960
if you shorten the work week and if you think about the way most of us work,

36
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.720
uh, we have bursts of productivity and then bursts of relative.

37
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.500
Like I'm not really doing a whole lot right now. Um,

38
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.240
and those bursts tend to correspond to when the

39
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:27.140
deadline is, but also what our schedule is like,

40
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.480
I'll give you an example. Um,

41
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.900
the most productive day that anyone has is the day before they're gone,

42
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.050
they go on vacation for awhile. Like, uh, like that, like that day,

43
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:38.900
all of a sudden it's like, you know, just get so much stuff done.

44
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.360
<v 0>Oh, he knows that feeling too. Yeah. So this just getting done this done today.</v>

45
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.740
<v 1>So your productivity, um,</v>

46
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.860
expands or contracts depending upon the schedule.

47
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:53.690
And that's why if you have a four day work week,

48
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.110
you may get the exact same amount done as you wouldn't a five day work week,

49
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.380
just get it done in less time. Um,

50
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.150
so let's stipulate that productivity let's say stays the same,

51
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.020
even though studies have shown it'll actually go up now, then,

52
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:10.060
then you have a three-day weekend, um,

53
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.960
which ends up improving your level of rest,

54
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.070
your mental health, your relationships, your time with family. Uh,

55
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.780
it actually has even been shown to, uh, help, um,

56
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.530
more evenly distributed, like domestic responsibilities, uh,

57
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.460
so that there are all of these positive effects. Um,

58
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.640
and the negative effects are, as far as I can tell,

59
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.210
quite absent in the data and here's the kicker.

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.490
It would help create jobs at the margins because if you're a firm

61
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.560
and you have a four day work week, and let's say you need coverage, um,

62
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.410
then you might have to hire another, like, you know,

63
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.120
20% of people and then like have them work different periods of time.

64
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.613
Uh, so,

65
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.220
and right now we're in a situation where we need to create jobs in the worst way

66
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.230
where we're going to be short tens of millions of jobs for months. Uh,

67
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.370
so anything we can do, that's going to stimulate hiring is a win. Um,

68
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.820
so the,

69
00:04:10.821 --> 00:04:14.890
the four day workweek to me is something that we should be seriously looking at.

70
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.040
And the way you make it happen is the same way you made the two day work week

71
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.330
happen, which is you, uh, pass a law saying, Hey, guess what?

72
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.790
Like these are going to be the expected work hours. Like,

73
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:29.230
of course you can have a firm that has people work different, uh,

74
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.960
hours, but then you have to, um,

75
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.520
accommodate your employees and like, you know, additional ways. And like, it's,

76
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.110
you know, um, Franklin.

77
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.900
<v 0>That's the dumb question? Is it like, is it it's a law? And so right now we,</v>

78
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.090
the weekend essentially structured on the 40 hour work week.

79
00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:48.150
You're not allowed to have a number of workers and a lot of work more than 40

80
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:52.560
hours a week if it's an hourly worker. Right. And so after a certain level,

81
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.420
right. And so you would make overtime after 30 hours or whatever.

82
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.400
<v 1>Well, you know, you, yeah. I mean, you could,</v>

83
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.310
you could work with the number of hours you could, uh,

84
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.280
like there are different ways you could make the, um,

85
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.220
the weekend longer. Uh,

86
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.790
I have a feeling though that it wouldn't take that much. Um,

87
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.480
because if you were to pass a law in this direction,

88
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.400
a lot of major companies would adopt it.

89
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.060
And then it's going to be very difficult for some companies to look up and say

90
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:22.530
like, actually, we're going to ignore that.

91
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.560
Like when literally their competitor companies are hiring,

92
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:29.010
the same people are doing, it's like,

93
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.340
and so it's really interesting if you're an employee,

94
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:34.850
like which company you're going to choose, you're going to choose the one that,

95
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.820
that with the four day work week. Um, and so they're going to end up with like,

96
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.713
you know,

97
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.710
better people who are going to have the same level of productivity and higher

98
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:46.110
contentment levels and better rest. You know,

99
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:49.350
it's like one of the signs to me about how sleep deprived we are is that when

100
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:52.020
you have daylight savings time, when you lose an hour of sleep,

101
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.890
car accidents go up, like, literally if like you,

102
00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:57.440
you have like one less hour sleep,

103
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:59.420
it screws us up enough where we're actually like,

104
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.920
like a non-trivial number of us are going to like, get an accident. Right. Uh,

105
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.110
so it's like, there's, and I'm, you know,

106
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:09.800
it's fun to have this conversation right now, like after Memorial day, because,

107
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.910
uh, you know, it's like that three day weekend, I was saying, it's like,

108
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:18.410
it's 50% better than a two day weekend. You know, you'll, you'll come back in,

109
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.950
you'll come back into the office, like much more ready to go.

110
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:25.430
You'll be more productive from front to back. Right. And there,

111
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:27.860
there are many workers, obviously that like aren't in this world.

112
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.900
So some people I know are looking to be like, well,

113
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:33.350
it doesn't apply to me because like, I'm like, you know, I've got a job that I,

114
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.830
medicine medicine, or it's like, I get paid hourly. So like,

115
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.220
what are you talking about? Um, so, so there,

116
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:43.730
there have to be ways that we make it, uh, like a universal, basic income, uh,

117
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.720
make it so that people are able to, uh,

118
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.530
work and not feel like they have to work themselves to the bone,

119
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.050
the way that many, many people do right now.

120
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.990
<v 0>Is there an argument that economic activity will be boosted</v>

121
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.740
because you have more weekends? Like do people spend,

122
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:05.620
I don't know if you know these numbers, do people spend more on the weekends?

123
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:07.930
I imagine, yes. When you have free time, that's when you're going to dinner,

124
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.000
that's when you're going on vacation. And that's when you're traveling this,

125
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.470
when you're spending more on gas, who knows?

126
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.540
<v 1>Yeah, of course. You know,</v>

127
00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:17.170
of course we spend more and more money on recreational stuff on weekends, uh,

128
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.670
than when you're working. Like, you know,

129
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.230
all you can do is eat lunch at your desk and whatnot. Right. Um,

130
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.850
the economy that is stimulative.

131
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.560
<v 0>Yup. The, but I also think this, I think this,</v>

132
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.500
it clearly pinched a nerve on Twitter when you, when you,

133
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.430
when you tweeted it out.

134
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:40.150
So that's why I wanted to explore it more with you in this.

135
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:43.330
And you talked about this a lot personally, and on the trail like this,

136
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.040
the why of like, it begs the question, why are we working?

137
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.950
You know what I'm saying? Um, and I think you.

138
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.940
<v 1>It's obvious Zack, where we're working to maximize GDP. Like,</v>

139
00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:58.930
have you made your GDP contribution today? If not, then you.

140
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.880
<v 0>Um, but you've kind of argued that work is activity that makes society better.</v>

141
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.850
Um, theoretically and now.

142
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.780
<v 1>Oh, I love to work. Don't get me wrong. I've, I've learned that the hard way,</v>

143
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:14.614
man.

144
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.250
<v 0>That Ronnie Chang thing where like Asians don't take off,</v>

145
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.620
they don't stop for Christmas. They don't stop for Thanksgiving.

146
00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:23.920
Like that's yang man. Like, there's like, Oh man, all day, I love that. Um,

147
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:26.740
you like finish your presidential run and you just kept working. Um,

148
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.440
you're insane. But, um, the, I,

149
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.740
we were joking on our team, Andrews.

150
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.220
The irony of we're going to work with the irony is we're going to work a seven

151
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:40.690
day work week to fight for a four day work week around the rest of the country.

152
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.600
<v 1>Yeah. That's pretty good summary, man. Um, so here's,</v>

153
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:50.350
here's the thing too, is like, if, if you have a four-day work week, um,

154
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.780
and you're someone who likes to work, then you know what you're gonna do,

155
00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:55.180
you're gonna get tons of work done during those four days.

156
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.060
And then those other three days,

157
00:08:57.061 --> 00:09:00.480
you're going to do different types of work on like yourself, your family,

158
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:04.410
your health, your relationships, your community, like you'll find stuff to do.

159
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.210
Uh, if you want to work, like nothing's going to keep you from, from working,

160
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.090
but you'll get the same amount of work done in less time.

161
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.280
<v 0>Yeah. I'm a fan. I was on the fence at first. I was like, wait,</v>

162
00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:17.101
we changed this up. And I,

163
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:20.390
I think there's a lot of arguments in the pro column and not a lot arguments in

164
00:09:20.391 --> 00:09:23.090
the con column, but the here's the money shot. Andrew,

165
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.180
do you pick Monday or Friday?

166
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.240
<v 1>Uh, my instinct is you pick Friday because I don't get done on Fridays.</v>

167
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.500
I'm just kidding. Um,

168
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.360
but, uh, you know, I mean,

169
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.330
another thing you do is you could just like let a company choose and then you'd

170
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:45.260
have some companies, uh, in effect Monday. And, uh, some companies in fact,

171
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:48.560
Friday, if, if you were like a certain type of business, but generally speaking,

172
00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:53.300
you'd want to pick the same day for most companies so that, um,

173
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.920
so that everyone would have the benefits,

174
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.930
because one of the things you realize quickly is that weekends are best when

175
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.800
they're synchronous. If you want someone to be sad, um,

176
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.510
you give them time off when no one else has time off. Yeah. So,

177
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.460
so, so generally speaking, we would just pick Fridays, um, um,

178
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.870
I think that would be the win.
