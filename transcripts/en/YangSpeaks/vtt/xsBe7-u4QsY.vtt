00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 0>Ezra had me intrigued when he said that you may be working on something or</v>

2
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:08.070
working on something big. Uh, and so he nudged me to ask you,

3
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.070
so I'm going to ask you, are you,

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.370
so the thing that came to mind for me is a new book, but it might,

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.230
but it sounded like it might be something else.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.571
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

7
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:22.130
so I'm working on a bigger project that I'm really excited about,

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.440
um, which is looking at the ways in which,

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.700
um, our safety and this actually grows out of the last book. Um,

10
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.380
our safety net, um, uh, was sort of described,

11
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.180
it was constructed to be difficult to use. And lo and behold,

12
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:46.010
when you had a real crisis in which people need to use, um, benefits, um,

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.750
or safety net programs, right? So UI, something like that or snap,

14
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.080
um, that, that, that then it, you know,

15
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:58.340
the systems can't contain these people. Um, and just in general,

16
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:03.290
I think that, that the government, uh, is dysfunctional for a lot of reasons,

17
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:07.040
but one of the ways in which the government is dysfunctional is that, um,

18
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.940
it doesn't have a very good customer service, orientation, uh,

19
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.560
things like doing your taxes are really confusing necessarily. So,

20
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.450
yeah, Y right. Um,

21
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.350
we have this enormously over complicated health system in which you have to

22
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.260
fight with an insurer and you have to figure out, you know,

23
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.990
does your doctor take this, that, or the other it's horrible.

24
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:29.230
And the government is crucial in that. And then you,

25
00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:32.810
you look at programs like snap or UI, and they're just a disaster.

26
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.130
And for this piece,

27
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:38.510
I was talking to some folks who work on these kinds of systems

28
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.150
in, uh, like Finland.

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.650
And they were just horrified that you might wait three months for UI benefits

30
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:49.850
here. It's like, literally unheard of there. And, and so, um, that's,

31
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:53.240
that's one thing that I've really been thinking about a lot this year. Um,

32
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.510
because I think it's in, in a lot of ways intentional, right?

33
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:59.240
We don't want the government to work very well. Um,

34
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.350
or at least a lot of people do.

35
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.820
<v 0>I want it to work well, Annie.</v>

36
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.180
<v 1>You do historically,</v>

37
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:08.750
many politicians have thought that these should be punitive programs,

38
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:12.980
that they shouldn't be ones that are easy to access or to use. And, and,

39
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:16.700
and it's, um, you know, a pretty paternalistic like, well, you know,

40
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.460
if you're unemployed and you need help from the state,

41
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:22.280
then you should have to go to this office and figure it out.

42
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:25.730
We don't want to make it too. It was a famous Paul Ryan line, right?

43
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:30.260
Like we don't want the safety net to be a hammock. Um, but, but I think that,

44
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:30.471
that,

45
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:34.340
that you can kind of back out and just see how little administrative capacity

46
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:36.740
the federal government has at this point. Um,

47
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.140
and the States that are administering federal programs,

48
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:41.900
and it's pretty horrifying, and it's a really hard problem to measure,

49
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.010
but it's like very obvious to everybody who ever interacts with any of these

50
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:46.844
systems.

51
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.130
<v 0>Oh, we all heard the horror stories of people getting busy signals for days and</v>

52
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:56.810
weeks on end, because they're trying to call their state unemployment office.

53
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.120
And the obvious question in my mind,

54
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.570
why the heck do you have to call someone to get your benefits?

55
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:02.860
Like what is going on here?

56
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.850
Like there should be myriad ways for you to access those benefits that do not

57
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:10.660
involve your, uh, getting frustrated dialing in.

58
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:12.820
And every time you call and get that busy signal,

59
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.610
it's an erosion in public trust, you know,

60
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:19.960
like w we're we're conditioned to think that things are supposed to be this

61
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:22.720
lousy and it's awful. Uh,

62
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.760
so you're writing a book about why things were designed to be lousy is

63
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.580
that [inaudible].

64
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.980
<v 1>Hang on a story on it now. Right. Um, and, and it, yeah,</v>

65
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.830
it's about, um, it's about, um, how it came to be that the,

66
00:03:39.831 --> 00:03:42.180
the administrator that it,

67
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.510
public administration became the burden of individuals instead of the

68
00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:48.570
government, because I think that that's functionally what happened. Um,

69
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.030
and I think that there's absolutely no reason for it.

70
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.250
It was a colleague was asking me, um,

71
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.890
why is it that unemployment isn't automatic?

72
00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:59.520
So as soon as you lose your job in a layoff, you don't get unemployment.

73
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.520
And I was like, well, because we've designed it not to be automatic. Like,

74
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:06.150
there's absolutely no reason that it couldn't be automatic. Um,

75
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.580
and the same thing for a lot of these, these programs, right?

76
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:13.560
Like why isn't it that if you are a parent with low income who has a new

77
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:16.740
kid, that you don't just automatically get a payment from the government, uh,

78
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:20.460
to support that kid's nutrition and to make sure that you have childcare other

79
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:23.850
countries do that. We don't. Um, and so I think that,

80
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:27.120
that this really grew out of, um,

81
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.270
my thinking about this really grew out of the last book where,

82
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:35.160
where one of the cool things about UBI is it just volts over a lot of these

83
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:38.160
problems. Um, but absent UBI,

84
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.330
there are a lot of fixes that other governments have taken, um, uh,

85
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.720
lots of updates that other governments have made. Um,

86
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.870
and I think that there's like an obvious the role of the Republicans in all of

87
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.340
this is a little bit more obvious.

88
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.870
But one thing that I think is especially fascinating is that it's not like blue

89
00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:58.800
States are a lot better on this front than red States, right. Um,

90
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.430
they have a lot of issues with administrative complexity. Um,

91
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.860
California has had an absolute disaster,

92
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:07.950
whether it's a UI system and people waiting months and months and months for

93
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:12.660
benefits. And, um, the problem is, is really systemic and multi causal.

94
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:17.460
And it touches all sorts of, um, programs, you know, um,

95
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.930
when you talk to people who are applying for asylum or people who are formerly

96
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:26.490
incarcerated and, you know, um, uh, are still involved in the judicial system,

97
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:27.780
it's all the same thing, right?

98
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:31.230
It's just endless red tape in a really profound way.

99
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.530
<v 0>This, this to me is the issue, Annie, that you, me as,</v>

100
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:42.030
or anyone else can just, we can beat the drum on this stuff because, uh,

101
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.490
everyone can see that our government is highly inefficient at delivering various

102
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:49.320
things, uh, to people.

103
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:52.470
And we are conditioned to think that's the way it supposed to be,

104
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:57.240
even though it's not supposed to be that way. And it hamstrings, uh,

105
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.760
the ability for progressives to effectively, uh,

106
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.680
both wind policy changes and argue for a bigger role of government

107
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.230
in improving our lives. In my opinion,

108
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:13.800
because even reasonable folks can look up and say, wait a minute. I get,

109
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.600
you know, like you couldn't get me unemployment benefits for weeks,

110
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:18.740
or I still haven't gotten them. I mean,

111
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.550
I hear these horror stories on Twitter all the time where people are like,

112
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:25.970
still haven't gotten them and it says September or whatnot. Um,

113
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.450
so we need to actually start paying attention to the mechanics,

114
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.470
like the nitty gritty.

115
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.510
It's one reason why you and I both like universal basic income because

116
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.480
I thought, well, if we champion a way to get value into people's hands,

117
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.850
then it's uniform and it's universal,

118
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.300
then we're going to figure out a way to actually get people that money.

119
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:46.340
And of course, everyone was a tenant of that money, you know, you know,

120
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.350
this would be like, they'd be like, where's my dividend. Uh, and it ends up, um,

121
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.400
uh,

122
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.090
building our capacity to actually add value in people's lives because you would

123
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:57.050
have to figure out the plumbing.

124
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.920
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. Um, and I think that there's,</v>

125
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.240
there's a bunch of win-win wins here, right? If things are simple and automatic,

126
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.990
I, you don't need a bunch of civil servants to administer it. Right. Um,

127
00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:12.490
and you can free the government up to do other things. Um, and we actually, we,

128
00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:15.220
there's a ton of political science research. There's, uh,

129
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.180
a really great scholar at Cornell named Jamila missioner.

130
00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:23.740
And a lot of her work is focusing on Medicaid and people's interaction with the

131
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:25.720
political system after, um,

132
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.540
after receiving Medicaid or working with the health system in general. And,

133
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:33.520
and we know one of the things that comes out of that is that in many ways,

134
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:38.440
interacting with our government reduces our interest in and confidence

135
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:39.610
in government, as you put it.

136
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.320
And there's even some evidence that it sort of dissuades people from voting and

137
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:46.570
disconnect them from the political process.

138
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.420
<v 0>No way. They're like, I want nothing to do with this.</v>

139
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.780
<v 1>Exactly. And I think that there's this really interesting,</v>

140
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:54.590
kind of like thought loop that you get in,

141
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.260
in which like public services are terrible and it erodes your confidence in

142
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:01.720
government, and then it becomes self justifying, right?

143
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:04.690
Like why would we want to put any more administration into this if the

144
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:06.280
government can't get anything right.

145
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.730
And I think that you can look at sort of positive cases of where the government

146
00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:12.340
does get stuff, right? Like actually,

147
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:15.370
most people who have Medicaid are pretty happy with it.

148
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.760
I'm old enough to remember when the argument about Medicaid was that it wasn't

149
00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:22.150
insurance worth having, but it, isn't sure it's worth having.

150
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:25.270
And people actually really like it. People are very happy with Medicare.

151
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.700
People are very happy with social security.

152
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.260
People are very happy with public libraries, for instance. Um, so like,

153
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:33.820
shouldn't we be setting that standard.

154
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.030
Shouldn't everything be as efficient and transparent,

155
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.380
and non-punitive non paternalistic as social security, right?

156
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:44.800
Like this is the argument for, for UBI, but you can,

157
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:47.530
you can make other changes, um,

158
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.900
to sort of nudge you in the direction.

159
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:53.230
So one change that I think we don't talk about very often,

160
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:56.370
but I think would be really good is that I think TANIF,

161
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.750
which is our cash welfare programs should be eliminated and replaced with a

162
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.880
child grant. Right. You should not have to apply. You should not have to, um,

163
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.870
you know, meet these really onerous, terrible work requirements.

164
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.750
You shouldn't have to interface with,

165
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:17.400
with a welfare office that in many cases, um, might,

166
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:20.400
might have some preconceived notions about you. If you,

167
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:25.050
if you are a person with a kid, we should just give you the help. Right. Um,

168
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.530
and, and we should take away all of the red tape and the judgment and the,

169
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:30.360
everything that goes with it. Um,

170
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.330
and so I think that that's probably the clearest case. Um,

171
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.860
TANIF is a really unworkable, punitive, terrible program, um,

172
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.190
depending on which state you're you're in. Um, and,

173
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:44.430
and it's also not big enough, right? Like it doesn't, um,

174
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.700
actually help enough people get out of poverty. Um,

175
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.620
cause it's been kept at this amount since 1996, uh, the same, the same, um,

176
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.390
amount, uh, gets appropriated for it every year. Um, and so big. Yeah,

177
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:00.780
I think as a general point, like making government work for people is,

178
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:04.110
is not necessarily a focus of our political system, but it really.

179
