1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.860
<v 0>This is something I've always wanted to ask you about,</v>

2
00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:04.740
and I'm excited to ask you about it since I've gotten to know you a bit and

3
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.120
now's maybe a good time. Um, cause I,

4
00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:10.800
I heard you on a podcast a while back when, when you were first, um,

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.020
campaigning for president and,

6
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.230
and you were talking about universal basic income,

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.110
but then you were also saying like,

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.770
and you could don't wanna put words in your mouth.

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.150
You could express this better than I could,

10
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.770
but you were talking about like having other programs and structures to

11
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:33.120
support kind of productivity and like

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.280
community driven collaborative efforts,

13
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:40.080
whether it's an art or in other fields that were not

14
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:44.340
necessarily driven by a commercial market, but,

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.080
um, but we're driven by other modes of Oh yeah. Yeah.

16
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.990
I'm so interested in, in how that works,

17
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:56.430
because I don't know that commerce is the only way to drive art.

18
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.590
<v 1>Yeah. Thank you for calling that out. Uh,</v>

19
00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:03.020
so that, to me,

20
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.660
the pillar number one is like put money into people's hands.

21
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.180
Would folks have more freedom to create? Yes.

22
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:11.570
Would they have more ability to reward artists and creators? Yes.

23
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.730
If you had better structures in place, uh,

24
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.940
but there's like this whole set of activities that, uh,

25
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.260
has been eroding for years and decades in the United States of America that we,

26
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.040
I think most of us agree are like pretty positive stuff that the market just is

27
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:29.360
not going to love. And one thing that let you know, I use as an example,

28
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.940
when I travel is like local papers, local newspapers,

29
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.060
local newspapers are getting wiped out like a, you know,

30
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:39.770
a thousand local papers gone and democracy does not function as well if you

31
00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:42.740
don't have local papers. Uh, so let's,

32
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.400
let's say even if we had more money in the community, sure.

33
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.170
Some more local papers would survive,

34
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:52.730
but maybe you decide that local journalism is good regardless of whether or not

35
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.270
like the advertising makes money or, you know, like the, the subscriptions.

36
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.620
And so if you start looking at some things that maybe we can agree are positive,

37
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.420
which I would definitely put art in this category,

38
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.920
I'd put local journalism in this category.

39
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.480
I put volunteering for a civic organization, um,

40
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.110
in this category. And so volunteerism is down, uh,

41
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.800
like pretty much anything where like that there's something that you regard as

42
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:20.420
positive in the community, um, has been declining by the numbers for years.

43
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.070
And so there's like this whole suite of activities where I don't think any of us

44
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.150
necessarily wants to get quote unquote paid for everything. It's like, Hey,

45
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:34.070
if I, you know, volunteer for the non-profit like, non-profit pay me. It's like,

46
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.380
there has to be like some sort of activity you do. That's like non-monetary,

47
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.080
but also, um, something that we,

48
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.020
we want to reward or reinforce.

49
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.850
And so my idea was essentially you create like a parallel economy

50
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.240
around this other set of activities that could,

51
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.690
that we could use another currency for or time. Um,

52
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.100
and it was based on something called time banking where, um,

53
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.630
in the sixties RFKs speech writer was trying to figure out how to help. Um,

54
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.810
poor communities become more socially connected.

55
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.030
And what they came up with was something called TimeBanking where if I babysit

56
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.900
your kids,

57
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.670
then you get me back by hauling like logs off my lawn.

58
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420
And we essentially just trade like units of time with each other. Um,

59
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.770
and so you could introduce like a different currency or time units into this

60
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:30.280
other set of activities that we know we need more of,

61
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.250
but you don't want to pay people for, cause it's like a little messed up.

62
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.920
So,

63
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.420
and I would certainly put art in this category where if someone produces public

64
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:43.840
art, uh, then they would get, uh, you know,

65
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.580
this other currency reward or other people get them back in

66
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:53.530
various ways. It'd be a way to try and stitch together, uh, social interactions.

67
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.670
Uh, and, and,

68
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.150
and also you could disclose it publicly in a way that you don't money.

69
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.590
So if I'm like, Hey, I made a thousand bucks, like I'm an.

70
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.450
If I'm like waving around like my thousand dollars my head,

71
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.650
but it, but if I got these like, you know, um,

72
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.990
a thousand, um, social points,

73
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.850
so whatever you call them, um,

74
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.570
then you could actually broadcast it in a way that everyone finds perfectly

75
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:24.490
socially acceptable. Um,

76
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.350
and then you could even give those social points to someone else. Um, and, uh,

77
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.390
and then they could use it for various things.

78
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.490
So that was like the thinking around like, uh, like you,

79
00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:39.340
you need something non-monetary for certain activities that you

80
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:40.780
want to help see more of.

81
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.110
<v 0>Can I ask you more about how that will work?</v>

82
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:45.810
I know you haven't like fleshed it out entirely.

83
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:49.050
So this is maybe just a totally hypothetical situation,

84
00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:52.920
but I just find that so fascinating. I want to ask you more about like,

85
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:54.480
so in the case of an artist, say,

86
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.210
cause that's obviously what's close to my heart and experience.

87
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.820
So someone who,

88
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.660
who makes some art say they make a, a song,

89
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.720
they record a song and it's,

90
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.590
it's not necessarily like the kind of commercially viable song that a

91
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:15.270
record label is going to invest in or something, but they,

92
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.780
they have the potential to earn this sort of whether it's like time,

93
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:23.220
time banking or social points or whatever you call it, how there,

94
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:24.060
there would have to be what,

95
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:28.440
some kind of system in place that would determine whether w how many social

96
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:31.710
points that song is worth, or like, how would that kind of.

97
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.630
<v 1>So the, my thinking on this,</v>

98
00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:36.090
and this is actually very close to the conversation I was having with the

99
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:39.570
musicians online, um, would be that if I listened to the song,

100
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.830
just by virtue of my listening to the song, you get like a social credit, uh,

101
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.630
uh, for the fact that I listened to it,

102
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.640
it's like essentially a micropayment thing.

103
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.350
<v 0>Oh God. Okay. So everybody who listens to it than that. Right. Okay.</v>

104
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.600
So it does have to do with, um,

105
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.090
the audience that you garner for art that you create. Yeah.

106
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.460
Right. But so, cause right now, the way that you can make money

107
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.320
or to get any kind of compensation for that sort of thing is say,

108
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.650
you put your song on YouTube, but your video on YouTube or whatever,

109
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.680
and YouTube is able to, if,

110
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.340
if a million or more people come and watch your video,

111
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.290
you might make enough money on ads that they'll give you like a few bucks. Um.

112
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.170
<v 1>This is the distinction you drew initially. Um, Joseph,</v>

113
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.880
cause I've been struggling with how the heck we got,

114
00:06:29.881 --> 00:06:32.710
we would get this done on a societal level.

115
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.520
You essentially want the world to look more like Netflix than YouTube.

116
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.250
<v 0>Right. It's like.</v>

117
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.920
<v 1>Where we're paying, but in this case you don't necessarily want.</v>

118
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.520
And I think like tier one,

119
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:50.020
which would be better is if we all had money and we're all paying for stuff.

120
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.770
Um, but then tier two would be like, Hey, I'm paying with my attention.

121
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.810
And you can take like this attention currency and use that for various things

122
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.290
to, um, some of which it could be monetary, um,

123
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.950
because you want to try and get the like, cause right,

124
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:09.430
right now people are conditioned to consume our content for free or near free.

125
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.910
Um, and then you pay it, then you pay a subscription and then you're like, okay,

126
00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:15.070
now I'm in the walled garden. And I get like the cool,

127
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.780
like a movie or TV show from like the, the Joseph [inaudible] of the world.

128
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.870
And so what you want to do is you want to create like,

129
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.890
like closer to that walled garden dynamic, um, out there,

130
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.770
like a way where if you pay attention to something,

131
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.050
then the creator is getting rewarded. Um,

132
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.290
and it doesn't necessarily necessitate my whipping out my credit card.

133
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.420
<v 0>Right, right. Cause someone has spent their time on your art.</v>

134
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.650
So if it were time banking, it would be that, that kind of thing. Yeah.

135
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.270
<v 1>And so like the, the time actually has value. Um, and then it,</v>

136
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.600
and then if people have elected to spend their time on your art,

137
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.550
then you actually like build up this time currency that you, you know,

138
00:07:57.551 --> 00:07:59.980
you could trade for dollars. Like, you know,

139
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:01.690
there could be like an exchange rate essentially.

140
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.290
<v 0>Right. So, and in order for that to happen, it would just,</v>

141
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:08.620
it would have to be kind of top down, right?

142
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.510
Like the government would have to say, okay,

143
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:13.660
there is the government is just like the government does with dollars.

144
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:17.770
Like dollars is a top-down thing. The government says we do United States.

145
00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:21.820
Government is deciding that us dollars are valuable. Right. And,

146
00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:24.610
and so you're saying that like the government would have to say,

147
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:29.200
we're also saying now that time is valuable and here is a like

148
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.900
government built structure,

149
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.760
like institution for how we can exchange time

150
00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:37.594
currency.

151
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.340
<v 1>So here's where it gets interesting.</v>

152
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.550
That TimeBanking is an effect right now in hundreds of communities around the

153
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:45.220
country like that, they're just doing it informally. They have some ledger,

154
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.710
they'll keep, keep, keep track of it. Um,

155
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.860
and there are also some apps, uh,

156
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.500
like there's one called civic stains of karma points.

157
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.310
There are different things where they're starting try and monitor this.

158
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.420
So if you were a foundation or a philanthropy or a billionaire or whatnot,

159
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.620
I know some of these characters, so this is an entirely hypothetically, like,

160
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.260
could you go in and say, Hey guys, guess what? Like, we're,

161
00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:12.060
we're going to essentially guarantee your time currency at like a certain

162
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:16.200
exchange. Um, and, uh, so if you do something for someone, you develop it,

163
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.310
you know, you get,

164
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.120
get a credit or you produce public art and people want to reward it. Um,

165
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.350
and then if you want, like,

166
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:26.220
we've got like essentially like an exchange bank and I'm going to monetize it to

167
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:30.270
the tune of a million bucks, 10 million bucks, whatever it is. Uh, and, and the,

168
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.630
the fun thing about this is that you could potentially create like,

169
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.650
like a hundred million worth of, uh,

170
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.120
interactions or social activity with like a much smaller level of money. Um,

171
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.360
but you would need to essentially do it within a community the same way that

172
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:47.340
communities are doing it with time banking. Right now.

173
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.910
I agree with you on a macro level, you'd probably need the government, uh,

174
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.920
lending a hand, like if you wanted to do it,

175
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:56.040
like throughout the entire us economy, and you were dealing with like massive,

176
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.530
um, numbers, but you could pilot this in a community, um,

177
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.150
certainly in terms of in-person activities and it's happening now. Uh,

178
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.490
and then the trickier thing, which is something that I,

179
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:13.470
I genuinely think that we need to be investing a ton of energy and

180
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.450
resources on is how to make it happen in the digital universe is how to make it

181
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.450
so that like a, your time is actually, uh,

182
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.700
monetizeable in a different way than advertising,

183
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.020
because we have to face facts that right now, so much of our internet, uh,

184
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.600
enjoyment or whatever is based on advertising.

185
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.200
And there was a period when it seemed like, okay, this is cool. Like I've got a,

186
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:37.260
you know, free Facebook for YouTube free this. Um,

187
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.880
but now it's degenerated into this form of pernicious surveillance, capitalism

188
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.630
where they're like, and among other problems, it's absolute for creators.

189
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.450
<v 0>Yes. Yeah. I think it really is. Uh, and, uh,</v>

190
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.750
and it, it's not just, um,

191
00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.480
it's not just the ads.

192
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.470
It's what comes with the ads.

193
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.310
Like you mentioned the difference between like a Netflix and a YouTube.

194
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.820
And again, I'm saying again, there's lots of great stuff on YouTube.

195
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.260
I love YouTube.

196
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.160
I look at YouTube all the time and I find amazing things that I never would have

197
00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:20.210
been able to find anywhere else. Like YouTube is incredible, but there,

198
00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:25.160
there is a difference between what YouTube will recommend

199
00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:27.170
versus what Netflix will recommend,

200
00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:31.880
because there's a difference between how they're monetizing the viewers that

201
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.620
Netflix is trying to serve viewers,

202
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:41.540
something that's so good and meaningful to them that they're willing to

203
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:43.160
pay out of their pocket for it.

204
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.740
Whereas YouTube is trying to serve up things that are just going to like catch

205
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.520
your attention and keep your attention. And it doesn't have to be,

206
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.190
it doesn't to be so profound or meaningful that you would pay money for it.

207
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.053
That doesn't,

208
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.470
it doesn't have to be that it just has to kind of catch you enough to keep your

209
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:06.490
attention. And those are two different offerings that are,

210
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.270
that are a result of those two different models.

211
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.870
And I think like, as an artist, I,

212
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.510
I'm much more interested in making art,

213
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.140
not that's just going to catch someone's attention and kind of like hook them

214
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.660
and keep their attention. I'm interested in making stuff.

215
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.930
That's going to be really meaningful to somebody that they're going to think

216
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:28.320
about afterwards. It's going to, like, they're going to remember.

217
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.850
<v 1>You create different, uh, work based upon one goal. And the other,</v>

218
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.350
the other thing is that if you do succeed in catching someone's attention,

219
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.580
even for like X minutes, and then afterwards, you're like, okay, like,

220
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.930
what did I get? Like as the creator, I mean, right now, like, you know,

221
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:49.170
in many cases it's next to nothing or nothing. Um,

222
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.370
and then that doesn't create like an ecosystem that enables that artist to like,

223
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.480
do something else reinvest. So, you know, uh, like pay themselves,

224
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.400
have health care, like whatever, like the, um,

225
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.110
like one of the basics that we'd expect anyone who's working, um, you know,

226
00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:08.040
creatively to have.

227
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.210
