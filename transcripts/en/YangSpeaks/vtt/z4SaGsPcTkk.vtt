1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>Are we looking at a cabinet position what's going on here?</v>

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.260
<v 1>Uh, so that's, there's absolutely nothing has been, you know, uh,</v>

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.030
discussed in like a hyper official level, but unofficially, um,

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.830
in the conversations we've had people like,

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.660
we'd love to have you on the team when a boom work with you.

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.870
Like things like that. I love. So what do you want to be.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.360
<v 0>Dream? What's your dream position there?</v>

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.870
<v 1>So what I've been saying, uh,</v>

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.850
to folks is that I want to try and speed us up on these technology

10
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:33.560
issues. And we could, you know,

11
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.570
I think the three of us could talk about this stuff for hours,

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.380
but our government is just so out to launch on technology issues.

13
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.040
And so that could be AI.

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.240
That could be the selling and reselling of our data that could be,

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.490
uh, media and social media.

16
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:53.330
That could be mental health issues that are attendant with smartphone adoption

17
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:55.880
on the part of teenage girls. They're all of these issues.

18
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.340
<v 0>Does that cabinet position even exist?</v>

19
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.350
<v 1>It does not. And then there's a good part. Um, but there,</v>

20
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:08.270
there is an advantage there because, uh, if they created a new role for me,

21
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.900
then it's not like they'd be blocking anyone out because it's not like they're

22
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:13.760
like 15 people being like, Hey,

23
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.670
I really want to be in innovation and technology.

24
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.250
<v 0>We created a new cabinet, a branch.</v>

25
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.540
<v 1>Yes. That is something. So yeah, you can, that's the short answer.</v>

26
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.300
<v 0>I mean, that's, that seems like a great,</v>

27
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.730
a great place to go and perfect gang style cabinet of technology,

28
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.400
um, secretary of technology.

29
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.660
<v 1>Secretary of technology and innovation, actually the Washington post, just,</v>

30
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.930
just put that out there today. They said, here's the cabinet we recommend.

31
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:46.520
And they said, Andrew Yang, like a secretary of technology,

32
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:50.120
innovation that devises all of the other cabinet.

33
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.910
That would be amazing.

34
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.830
<v 0>I'm lobbying for that from now on.</v>

35
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.100
<v 1>Can we actually.</v>

36
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.420
<v 0>I don't think Joe would CA I think Joe could garner a lot of, of, uh,</v>

37
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.300
support by, by making that happen.

38
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.390
<v 1>Do we have any input in making that happen? Like,</v>

39
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:12.410
can we do anything if people were to,

40
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.810
if there was a groundswell of support being like, Hey Joe,

41
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.260
like if you signal to everyone that you're going to name Andrew,

42
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:22.070
the secretary of technology and innovation that would help us vote for you. Um,

43
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.240
they might do it because there's no reason not to really. I mean, like, again,

44
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.280
it's not like a role that exists presently. And so, you know,

45
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.360
it would make him seem forward thinking so enough people and this stuff,

46
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.990
you know, it's not, uh, that under the radar, in the sense, again,

47
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:41.780
the Washington post just recommended it. So,

48
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.900
and when I've spoken to people that like me, they were like, well,

49
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:48.590
this makes me more excited about Joe. If I bring you on in this capacity.

50
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.260
<v 0>If you get this cabinet position, which we're all hoping for, tell me, tell me,</v>

51
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.130
what are the first things that you think like you're sitting down in America,

52
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.180
you're part of the cabinet. What do we need to do first?

53
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:05.800
What is the most pressing things we need to address in this country? America?

54
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.470
<v 1>I mean, clearly it's casually for universal basic income, you know, it's like,</v>

55
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.610
that's just like the simple thing. Um, it sounds, you know, that's,

56
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.790
to me the single best thing we could do for people.

57
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.630
So let's say if you say something technology-related then I, you know,

58
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.120
I I'd actually choose something related,

59
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.660
which is what we talked about earlier around the fact that we didn't actually

60
00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:29.610
have a system set up to get people money.

61
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.450
So we use the IRS check distribution system. Um,

62
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.460
and I think it's bad for our confidence in our government that it sucks so

63
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.860
bad. And a lot of these things where like,

64
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.270
if you go to your bank's website or whatever,

65
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:49.470
you just expect it to work generally a certain level. Um, and then,

66
00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:52.830
so you'd be like, well, why isn't the government to have something? So,

67
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:57.120
one thing I'd love to invest in would be essentially a citizen portal where if

68
00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.030
there was something like we're trying to get you money or trying to get you

69
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:00.900
information,

70
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.980
or so the lamest version of this would be a citizen portal where it's

71
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:05.790
essentially like,

72
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.540
here are all of these links to other government websites that you can go to.

73
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.730
Like, that would be the absolute worst version. The best version would be. So

74
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.820
like one of those boards where it's like,

75
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.900
here's a pretty good flurry of websites to go to you. But

76
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.970
like the good Virgin would be like a,

77
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.640
a slick interface where like, you know,

78
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:34.200
like the information from let's call it your tax returns, uh,

79
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.010
or, uh, from, uh,

80
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.690
the passport office or wherever the heck, like could actually be compiled. Uh,

81
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.260
because part of the thing that makes me angry right now is that like,

82
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.980
you're hearing a lot of messages from folks all the time associated with

83
00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:52.170
politics. We're just like, trust us. Trust is you got to trust us.

84
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:53.004
And it's like, well,

85
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.080
like you guys don't really deliver the same level as like some of the other

86
00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:00.600
organizations I've used to interacting with. Um,

87
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.230
so I would love to try and help the government deliver at like a,

88
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.800
on a technical level, because I think it would be enormous for our confidence.

89
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.620
Uh, so that would be something I would love to,

90
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.630
especially if it was tied to universal basic income,

91
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:15.390
because I think that there is a relationship where, um,

92
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.620
we need to actually know who you are, know how to get you money,

93
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.240
have to have some kind of secure relationship with you and interface with you.

94
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.960
If we're going to try and, you know, add value.

95
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.180
<v 0>Don't you think the big problem is that all of our elected officials and</v>

96
00:05:33.181 --> 00:05:37.350
even, you know, uh, Joe by, I mean, how old is Joe?

97
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:39.540
He's like 74 or something like that. I mean.

98
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.700
<v 1>Um, I think, I think he's, uh, like 76 or 77, I think.</v>

99
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.030
Um, I don't want to misspeak. I should know that. I mean, he's.

100
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.190
<v 0>In his, Oh, you're looking it up. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.290
<v 1>Okay. Let's see. I mean, maybe one of your team.</v>

102
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.730
<v 0>Yeah. Look it up. Uh, Zach he's 77 years old. Whoa.</v>

103
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.910
So, so don't you think that's the, it,

104
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.310
we need young people who understand this,

105
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.540
like a seventies I've no 77 year old people. They're not interested in cash app.

106
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.210
Do you know what I mean? They understand checks and that's not their fault.

107
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.610
It's just the way it is.

108
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.120
But I think like we have this tendency of electing,

109
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.980
especially lately old people to office, even Donald Trump is in his seventies.

110
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:27.770
Right. He's like 72, 73 years old. I mean, these,

111
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.450
although he's a little to be, Oh, 74, somehow.

112
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:36.500
He doesn't somehow Trump, I guess.

113
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.890
<v 1>He's got a young energy, such an. He's got that energy that associated with.</v>

114
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.300
<v 0>He does a lot. He does a lot with this. He does like a spray tan and that hair.</v>

115
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.850
Yeah.

116
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.080
<v 2>It's used to the cameras. I think he just on camera.</v>

117
00:06:50.081 --> 00:06:53.050
I think it comes off like that. I'll re say, I never met him in person,

118
00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:56.620
but I have a feeling if you saw him in person, he would look that age to you.

119
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.960
<v 0>Do give him credit. He is, he has a more youthful spirit for whatever reason.</v>

120
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.650
And he's on Twitter. That's pretty, that's pretty Epic. But that being said,

121
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:09.910
I don't think Trump uses cash app either. And so what we need is, is,

122
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.090
is younger people. I really truly think we just need younger people.

123
00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:16.150
And that's one of the reasons not, that was one of the reasons why I liked you.

124
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.050
Right. And one of the reasons I like AOC is that we just like AOC.

125
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:24.760
Does Instagram live every like super frequently to talk

126
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:28.310
directly with her? Uh, yeah.

127
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.120
<v 1>She's like a digital native, uh,</v>

128
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.350
think the average age of a member of Congress is 62 to your point, Ethan.

129
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:37.090
So it was not just presidential candidates, right?

130
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.180
Someone called it a gerontocracy take a rule by the old,

131
00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:44.170
we essentially have a gerontocracy in the United States of America for a number

132
00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:48.350
of reasons. Uh, one of the main reasons is that after you get into Washington,

133
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.230
you just try and stay there forever. Uh,

134
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.280
and it's actually very hard to defeat an incumbent. So you have folks,

135
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.260
uh, like, um, Nancy Pelosi I believe is, uh, around Joe's age.

136
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.130
Um, and she looks great, but she does,

137
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.620
but our leaders are of a nother generation, uh,

138
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.560
because of the way the structure is, the, the,

139
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.380
the structures are set up. And it's one reason why I'm for term limits, um,

140
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.610
where you should go to DC as a term of service,

141
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.160
get something done and then get out, uh,

142
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.930
and it would help keep our legislators more current and fresh and modern to your

143
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:31.990
point, Ethan, because if you go to DC,

144
00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:36.790
you'll find it is not exactly a tech friendly town. Uh, you know, you go,

145
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.950
I'll tell a story that was going to make you angry,

146
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:43.930
but it will be totally consistent with your understanding of the world. So, uh,

147
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.250
so I was on the trail and then there was like this, uh, uh,

148
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.920
Asian kid was like, you know, mid twenties maybe. Um,

149
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.920
and he interned at his congressional office and then they asked him to like, uh,

150
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.820
do, do something, um, uh,

151
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.630
like answering messages or data related, like in the office.

152
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.280
And he was smart.

153
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:12.930
So he set up like a program to like automate the process and make it so that

154
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:16.830
okay, like this thing will like happen more seamlessly and like, you know,

155
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.680
like less labor, um, this'll be great.

156
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.080
And then they yelled at him for it and said like, no,

157
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:25.320
we didn't want you to do that. Like, uh, like where,

158
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.700
where we actually preferred the way that like the other person, uh,

159
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.010
could just understand and just like sit there and like,

160
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:35.510
just pick at it all the time. And he was like, what the hell is going on? I did,

161
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.760
there's like a congressional office. And so he left, he now works at Facebook.

162
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.700
He like went and worked in DC for like a summer, was like,

163
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.420
they are freaking stuck in like the stone age. Let me get the hell outta here.

164
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:48.540
And then he like peaced out to Silicon Valley. So like that,

165
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:52.620
that is the general culture in DC where you go there and you feel like you just

166
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.610
rewound, uh, like a, a number of years.

167
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.490
And if you go into some of these government agencies, it's much,

168
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:02.970
much worse because some of them have been underfunded.

169
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:07.110
So you have like very strange patchwork technologies, uh,

170
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.910
from past years, uh, you know, like, I mean, I might be exaggerating,

171
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.380
but probably not my much it'd be like windows,

172
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.760
like 2005 or whatever that you go in and they'll just be used up all over,

173
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.460
um, in, in different, uh, different government organizations. So it,

174
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.300
so that's, that's the government we have. Um, and like you said before,

175
00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:30.390
it's like not really anyone's fault. Um,

176
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.900
but we need to try and speed them up. Um,

177
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.980
and if I'm in position to try and move that in a better direction,

178
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:39.900
like I've taken and do everything I could.

179
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.210
<v 0>That sounds really we have to, yeah, we have to do that. I mean, I think the,</v>

180
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.920
I think we would probably miss that the rate of technology has Sur as

181
00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:53.060
past our,

182
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.410
our people it's been going so fast that it's past them. Right.

183
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.170
When Joe Biden was a one in his forties,

184
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.350
even fifties, like 25, 26, seven years ago,

185
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.400
it was a, we were in 1995. I mean,

186
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.850
I don't even know that smartphones were popular then I don't think, no,

187
00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:17.840
not even close, not even close. Right. So, I mean, in,

188
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.950
in his own experience and in government,

189
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.490
the technology as ran around him like 30 times,

190
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.850
so it's a new, it's a new world.

191
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.290
<v 1>They got rid of the office of technology assessment in 1995,</v>

192
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.770
the year you just described the perfect time to get rid of it. Yeah.

193
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:37.650
But they had a,

194
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.030
they had a department that advised members of Congress on what technology,

195
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.540
you know, they should care about and like opinions,

196
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.920
like why didn't they do that?

197
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.780
Why did they get rid of the office of technologies? That's been, uh, you know,

198
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.100
like, it, it, it was like to quote save money,

199
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:55.660
which is like the most asinine thing in the world,

200
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.570
because the budget of the entire thing was like 25 million.

201
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.100
It was like a drop in the bucket.

202
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.080
You just had some smarter people around telling you. It's like, Hey,

203
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.790
so you know where legislators get their technology guidance from now the

204
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.370
technology companies and the technology companies are like,

205
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:12.430
do absolutely nothing because everything is perfect.

206
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.290
And that the legislators are like, yeah, that sounds about right.

207
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.820
<v 0>Perfect. Yeah. That whatever requires the least of me. Yeah. So,</v>

208
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.900
and especially if you're donating $25 million to my campaign, that's fantastic.

209
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.701
<v 1>There was a period,</v>

210
00:12:29.701 --> 00:12:32.670
and it's been interesting to see the pendulum swing somewhat.

211
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.570
So Silicon Valley could do no wrong for a long time.

212
00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:38.250
Where do you see is cause it's, they're just like, Oh,

213
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.750
you're like the innovators, you're the super value creators. And you're rich as.

214
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.030
And you donate to my campaign. So let's just like,

215
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.760
leave you the heck alone and just sing your praises every chance we get. Uh,

216
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.380
and then that pendulum has swung because of, uh, like, uh,

217
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.220
Facebook screwing, some things up and, uh, and, and some other problems. Uh,

218
00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:01.860
so now everyone's starting to turn on a turn towards them and be like,

219
00:13:01.861 --> 00:13:03.810
wait a minute. Like, you know,

220
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.820
is this really been like cool that Amazon is, you know, like, uh.

221
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.370
<v 0>Andrew Yang, future secretary of technology and innovation</v>

222
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.223
love this one.

223
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.190
<v 1>Essentially. And if that happened,</v>

224
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.640
I certainly have U2 and a lot of other people to thank.

225
00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:23.400
But the big thing right now is just for us to help each other,

226
00:13:23.401 --> 00:13:27.330
try and get through this mess and stay strong and healthy ourselves.

227
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.320
Cause you can't help anyone if you can, you know, like help yourself.

228
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.330
But then if you do have the capacity to help others,

229
00:13:33.331 --> 00:13:36.360
please do lend someone a hand. Cause like someone in your life needs a hand.

230
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.160
<v 0>Can we count on an interview from Washington DC a year from now?</v>

231
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.620
<v 1>Yeah, definitely.</v>

232
00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:48.360
Like if I'm the secretary of technology innovation,

233
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.560
uh, then we'll have so much to talk about and then leave,

234
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.230
it ended up being like one of these types of being like, Hey, send me ideas,

235
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.810
citizens, because I am now.

236
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.480
<v 0>Yeah. And Andrew, if there are UFO's, will you tell us that you have.</v>

237
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.210
<v 1>If I find out there are UFO's, uh,</v>

238
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.500
I will tell people because we all know they're there already.

239
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.863
You let me ask you that.

240
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.930
<v 0>Yes. If someone's like, okay, Andrew, we're going to give,</v>

241
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.500
we're going to tell you that UFO's and the aliens and all this crazy exists,

242
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.520
but you can't tell anyone. Do you tell us.

243
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.610
<v 1>Depends on who it is really. I mean, you know, it's someone I can be like,</v>

244
00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:32.190
sorry, man. Like I just had to tell people that'd be.

245
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.200
<v 0>But there's no way you would actually be able to tell us that you see the</v>

246
00:14:37.201 --> 00:14:38.034
problem.

247
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.660
<v 1>I do see the problem. If they bring me into the circle of UFO trust,</v>

248
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.590
then it's hard to run outside of the circle and tell Ethan in Hilo.

249
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.070
<v 0>Or you die. Just get the truth out there. Yeah. Blink twice your on your death.</v>

250
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.140
<v 1>Bed. Um, that done deal. Deathbed,</v>

251
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.140
UFO confession. Yes. There we go.

252
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.780
<v 3>All right. Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation.</v>
