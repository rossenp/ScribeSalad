00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.080
<v 0>For the most part,</v>

2
00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:05.580
the way Congress works and has worked for many years now is the speaker of the

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:10.470
house has to let it go through. If the speaker says, no, it's not moving. Um,

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.440
the speaker has amassed a tremendous amount of power.

5
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:17.820
This probably started in the Gingrich days. This was before my time, of course,

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.380
um, and has continued and has, has gotten, um,

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.970
with successive speakers has gotten worse. For example,

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.130
during my time in Congress, John Bayner a man. I tried to oust from Congress.

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.550
I tried to oust him from the speakership. I didn't want to be a speaker anymore.

10
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.780
Cause I thought he was so bad.

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.240
He actually ran a more open Congress than Paul Ryan or Nancy Pelosi.

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.920
And that's hard to believe, like if I could go back in time and say to 'em,

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.940
you know, pass Justin Amash, Hey, this is actually as good as it gets right now.

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.750
I would have probably changed my approach to it and said, Hey,

15
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:57.360
I guess we were going to stick with John Bayner for now,

16
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.240
but I tried to oust him cause I thought he was so bad. I mean,

17
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:05.190
this was a guy who one time called me a terrorist and I still, um,

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.150
you know, think he was probably the best speaker. Um,

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.200
we've had overall because he was, he cared about, uh,

20
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.750
opening up the process, uh,

21
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.500
relative to his successors. Um,

22
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.530
it wasn't a super open process,

23
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.180
but at least we could offer amendments on the house floor from time to time.

24
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.210
And we don't have any of that now.

25
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.910
<v 1>So why do these bills get presented without the</v>

26
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:40.430
opportunity for amendment? It is that,

27
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.910
cause it sounds like that's a big part of the problem is that, well, Hey,

28
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:45.260
it's taking her, leave it. And then you're like,

29
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:47.030
well I guess like if I can't change it,

30
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:50.600
I'm going to have to say no to this thing. Um, when did that become the norm?

31
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.780
<v 0>So, um, until about 2016, May, 2016,</v>

32
00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:01.400
which is a while Paul Paul Ryan was speaker. It was,

33
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.480
uh, the tradition of the house that, uh, particularly, uh,

34
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.840
particularly on appropriations bills. So these are the spending bills.

35
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.720
You had something called an open process where any member of the house

36
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:18.710
could come to the house floor during the reading of the bill and offer an

37
00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:21.860
amendment. And as long as the amendment was germane to the bill,

38
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.380
that member would get a vote on that amendment.

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.240
So we would have votes on all sorts of things, especially like I said,

40
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.630
an appropriations bills and, um, that,

41
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:37.460
that was the tradition of the house for, uh, you know, over 200 years.

42
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.260
And then along comes Paul Ryan. And he says,

43
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.880
you know, the Democrats are trying to put in these poison pill amendments,

44
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.570
they are offering amendments that are causing, um,

45
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.850
our members to have really tough votes.

46
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.880
And we don't want to have these tough votes.

47
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:59.260
So what he told the Republican conference, cause I was there at the, uh,

48
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.030
when he announced this, he said, look,

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.140
we're going to shut down the open process. Um,

50
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.460
you guys can bring your amendments and present them to the rules committee.

51
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.640
And I will allow a lot of amendments to go through and

52
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:19.330
be voted on the floor, but I will be able to weed out the, the, um,

53
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.620
as he called them, you know, the, the dangerous or poison pill,

54
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.960
democratic amendments, we can weed those out.

55
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.430
And Republicans were sitting there in the room and they were like, yes, yes,

56
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:35.260
let's do this. And I objected, I said, this is crazy.

57
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.550
And first of all, he's telling you, he's going to just weed out these, um,

58
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.960
you know, a poison pill amendments.

59
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.060
He's going to weed out all sorts of amendments once,

60
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.180
once this process starts and what's the end game.

61
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.330
So what happens when the Democrats are in charge, then they're like, you know,

62
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.980
ending Republican amendments,

63
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.970
this is a dangerous game to play and we shouldn't be doing this.

64
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:58.930
We should have an open process. We are a body, um,

65
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.710
where we're supposed to discover the outcomes through the legislative process.

66
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.510
But, you know, I lost that argument and Republicans went forward with that.

67
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.730
They shut down the amendment process.

68
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.770
And Paul Ryan became the first speaker in the history of our country to have a

69
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.820
whole term where we had no open amendments. In other words, there,

70
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.540
there was never a piece of legislation during his whole term that he was speaker

71
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.220
of the full, the full term.

72
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:27.670
He served as speaker where we were allowed to go to the floor and offer an

73
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:28.504
amendment.

74
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.740
And Nancy Pelosi has carried that on during her tenure as speaker.

75
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.450
She is not allowed a single open process, um,

76
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.210
during her entire tenure as speaker during this recent tenure, I,

77
00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:44.350
I can't speak for before. She must have allowed it before,

78
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.660
but recently she's followed the precedent set by Paul Ryan and

79
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:54.370
that's really bad for the American people. It's really,

80
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:59.030
really bad. Um, I mean, we could talk about this for a long time, but it,

81
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:03.010
it affects everything. It affects executive power, for example,

82
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.960
uh, I'll give you, um, just, just to,

83
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.150
to flush that out a little bit.

84
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.610
If the president of the United States knows that he only has to negotiate with a

85
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:18.880
couple people, it makes his job a lot easier.

86
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:23.680
He can get what he wants a lot more easily than if he has to negotiate with the

87
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:24.850
entire Congress.

88
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.860
So you've just given the president a tremendous amount of leverage by closing

89
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:33.040
down the process that the, uh,

90
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.070
framers of the constitution never intended the president to have.

91
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.480
And he only has to negotiate with Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell essentially.

92
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.280
Right? There's only two people.

93
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:45.250
He has to get it through because they run the whole show.

94
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.900
Nobody else has any say. Now people say to me,

95
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:53.350
when I say let's open up the process, let some let's allow amendments, Oh,

96
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:56.800
this will take forever, Justin, this will it'll. You'll slow everything down.

97
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.820
Well, first of all, we,

98
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.910
we spent a lot of time on things we don't need to be spending time on in

99
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.240
Congress. I mean, there's like a lot of stuff that.

100
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.690
<v 1>No, no, I just want to stop here for a second, Justin.</v>

101
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.140
And just joke that it's like, Oh,

102
00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:15.670
because Congress has such this model of legislative efficiency right now that if

103
00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:19.120
you were to allow amendments that you'd be interfering with this well-oiled

104
00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:20.470
machine that is just humming along.

105
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.523
<v 0>Anyone,</v>

106
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.630
anyone looking at it right now knows that Congress is not working

107
00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:30.190
efficiently under this model.

108
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.020
This model of minutia negotiates with Pelosi and McConnell is

109
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:39.490
not efficient. It's taken months look at the COVID relief stuff.

110
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.560
It's yeah, it's taken months and months to get anything.

111
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:46.930
And then they just, they negotiate for a couple of weeks.

112
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.230
Then the president says something on Twitter, and then they're like, Oh, we're,

113
00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:53.980
we're stopped. We're going to stop negotiating now. And then he says, no, no.

114
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:57.820
I changed my mind. And they started again, this has been going on, um,

115
00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.620
for months, for months now.

116
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.140
And if you just put legislation on the house floor and allow us all

117
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:09.130
to participate every single member, if Justin Amash has an idea,

118
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:14.020
let me offer it for people who say that it'll slow down the process to offer

119
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:17.230
amendments. It won't slow down the process. It will speed up the process. And,

120
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.270
and you know, what else, you know, what else happens?

121
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.670
Every member of Congress then feels like they participated in the process.

122
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.720
And so it brings them on board and brings their constituents on board with

123
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:33.070
whatever the final packages. Because now you can say to your constituents,

124
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.670
I offered an idea that you guys really wanted,

125
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:38.110
my constituents wanted this thing.

126
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:40.480
I went into the house floor and I offered it as an amendment,

127
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.400
but it didn't pass it failed.

128
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.980
So this is the product that is the compromise of the house of

129
00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:51.310
representatives. And a lot of members will then say, well,

130
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.810
this is the best we can do.

131
00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:55.600
And this is something that I'd be willing to vote for.

132
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.240
There are other members who say, no, I'm not willing to vote for it.

133
00:07:58.241 --> 00:07:59.200
And that's okay too.

134
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.330
But the fact is we went through a process and we got something that,

135
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.860
uh,

136
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.330
in a much better way reflects the will of the American people and reflect the

137
00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:14.080
representatives of the people there using their judgment on behalf of the

138
00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:14.914
people.

139
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.450
<v 1>Why do you think more has not been made of the fact that the legislative process</v>

140
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:23.380
now, uh, shuts down the ability to amend? Um,

141
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.610
because at this point it's been in effect since 2016, uh,

142
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:31.070
we can see some of the negative effects. People are very, uh,

143
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:33.760
upset about how, uh,

144
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.810
unresponsive Congress has been to crisis after crisis at this point.

145
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:42.010
And COVID relief is the crisis of the moment. Uh,

146
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.990
I have not heard that much in the press, uh, beating up, um, either Paul,

147
00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:49.780
Ryan or Nancy Pelosi for shutting down amendments.

148
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:52.810
And it seems like a fundamental problem. Would you agree, first of all,

149
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:54.940
with the sense that this is somewhat under.

150
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.330
<v 0>Oh, it's way under reported and I've complained to reporters about it.</v>

151
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.420
I've said, this is like, this is the big story,

152
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.820
because when I go to town halls and I talk to my constituents and, um,

153
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.091
you know,

154
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:12.390
obviously we haven't been doing in person town halls with the COVID situation,

155
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:17.100
but, uh, back in the day, they would say to me, Justin,

156
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.590
um, you know, the process is all fine at all. Like, it's,

157
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:24.000
it's nice that there's some procedural problems,

158
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:27.210
but we care about the substance. We need to get this to spill.

159
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.230
And I say to them, you can't get that bill that you want.

160
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.040
You can't get that idea that you want without an open process.

161
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.570
There's no way for a member of Congress to bring that to the floor

162
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.940
to offer it. So

163
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.170
there's this expectation that I,

164
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:51.090
as a member of Congress can go and just offer things and have

165
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:55.890
votes on them. And that's just not true. Um, I can't even tweak bills.

166
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.510
So let alone, I mean, forget the idea of offering my own bill.

167
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.430
I can't even amend bills. So that is a real problem.

168
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:09.240
And it's under reported, I think, because it's just not a sexy topic,

169
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.253
like really.

170
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.600
<v 1>Cause this strikes me as very, very weird in the sense that it's very impactful.</v>

171
00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:16.100
I mean, you and I.

172
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.110
<v 0>Yeah. You know, I think this is like in our wheelhouse where,</v>

173
00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:25.760
you know, I'm, to me, I'm like a procedure person. This is sort of how I think,

174
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:28.340
I think about process. Um,

175
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:33.320
because if you control the process that has a big impact on the outcome.

176
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:35.930
So the way the, the, um,

177
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.050
leadership teams are controlling the process now in both the house and Senate

178
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.720
that impacts the outcome very directly,

179
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.940
I would hope that we can all agree on following a process that allows

180
00:10:46.941 --> 00:10:51.860
everyone to participate so that the libertarian can offer

181
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:55.940
ideas on the house floor. The progressive can offer ideas on the house floor.

182
00:10:55.941 --> 00:10:58.160
The conservative can offer ideas on the house floor.

183
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.360
We want to bring all of these viewpoints to this

184
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.310
magnificent body that was created in our country,

185
00:11:07.311 --> 00:11:10.640
this magnificent body to, uh,

186
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.860
to legislate on behalf of the American people.

187
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:17.330
We want to bring all of these viewpoints there and work to persuade each other,

188
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.520
but I can't do that until we fix the procedural process

189
00:11:22.521 --> 00:11:26.870
stuff. So my focus, my focus really has been on that.

190
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.240
<v 1>Thank you for listening in. I hope you enjoyed this conversation. If you did,</v>
